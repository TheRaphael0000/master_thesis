## Thesis / Report

- [Final version TODO]()

## Code

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.8.8 : Programming language
- Pip >= 21.1.3 : Python packet manager
- *the packages in requirements.txt* : See Installation

### Installation

```
cd code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

The experiments (runnable scripts) were written in a Jupyter notebook file format.

Jupyter is installed with the requirements, if you do not already have it.
After installing it, you can simply run, for example, JupyterLab, a web IDE for Jupyter notebooks, with the command below.

```
cd code
jupyter lab
```

## Repository

This repository history may be not accurate.
This is due to a history rewrite that happened on July the 12th.
The repository was private until this date.

During the git history rewrite, copyrighted files were removed from the tree (copyrighted papers .pdf files), to be allowed on GitHub.
`git filter-branch` was used to the rewrite the history.
