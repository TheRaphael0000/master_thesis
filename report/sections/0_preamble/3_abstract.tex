This study aim to select different text representations and distance metrics to create rank lists for authorship attribution.
Among the vector based text representation: Word frequency, Letters n-grams frequency, POS n-grams.
$L^1$, $L^2$ and inner product based distances are in conjunction to compute distance between documents.
In addition to the vector representation, the compression techniques are also applied.
The Oxquarry, Brunet and St-Jean corpora are used to evaluate the system.
With the selected rank lists, a new rank list is created by fusing them.
Two approaches are explored for the fusion: one use Z-Score normalization and another one use Logistic Regression.
The Z-Score normalization give us the best results.
With this technique, the rank list obtained by fusion give results superior compared to the best rank list used for the fusion.
In addition to the fusion, two veto strategy are proposed to enhance the fusion.
The veto do not show any significant improvements with rank lists used.
In a second part, the rank list obtained by fusion is used to solve the authorship clustering task.
The clustering task is achieved by using three different models based on hierarchical clustering.
A Silhouette score based model, distribution-based and a regression based clustering models are proposed and evaluated.
The three models show similar correct results.
The clustering obtained by these models are close to the best achievable clustering for the rank lists used.
