  I particularly wanted to thank Prof. Jacques Savoy who not only help me throughout the study but also gave me really helpful advices and documents.
  My thesis could not have been completed without the University of Neuch√¢tel's (UniNE) computational linguistics research group and the PAN @ CLEF committee, who gave me access to corpora used in the study.
  I also want to thank the pan.webis.de website, which gave me free access to most of the papers studied in this thesis.
