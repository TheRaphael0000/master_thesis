\begin{abstract}
  I particularly wanted to thank Mr. Savoy who not only help me throughout the study but also gave me really helpful advices and documents.
  My thesis couldn't have been completed without the University of Neuch√¢tel's (UniNE) computational linguistics reserach group and the PAN @ CLEF committee who gave me access to corpora used in the study.
  I also want to thanks the pan.webis.de website which gave me a free access to most of the papers studied in this thesis.
