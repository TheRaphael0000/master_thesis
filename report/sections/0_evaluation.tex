\section{Evaluation \label{sec:evaluation}}

This section explains the different evaluation metrics used and experiments realized on the corpora to evaluate the proposed methods (ref. Chapter~\ref{sec:methods}).
Each experiment of this chapter is described by its purpose in the study, the methodology used to conduct it, the results obtained in the form of: graphic, table or statistics, an analysis of the results and sometimes a few additional conclusions to the experiment.
The chapter is separated into four parts: one concerning the creation and the evaluation of rank lists according to the proposed methods, the proposed fusion methods, the clustering tasks, and an analysis on the errors encountered.
