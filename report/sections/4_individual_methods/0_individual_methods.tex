\chapter{Individual Rank Lists Methods \label{sec:individual_methods}}

In this chapter, the goal is to find individual methods which yield a good rank list for the authorship verification task.
These rank list can also be used for the authorship clustering task, which is explored in Chapter~\ref{sec:clustering}

The method adopted was to compare documents using the authorship linking strategies presented in \textit{Evaluation of text representation schemes and distance measures for authorship linking}~\cite{kocher_verification}.
The strategy used in this paper is based on the most frequent (MF) approach.
This method aim to compare the similarity of documents by considering recurrent stylistic textual patterns.
Text patterns can be, for example, from either recurrent words, short sequences of characters (known as n-grams) or Part-Of-Speech (POS).

Another possible method is to compare similarities between document with compression techniques.
This method is also slightly explored in this study.

For each method, the parameters that give the best results over the three corpora are retained and summarized at the end of this chapter.
The chapter main objective is to have the most reliable authorship linking rank list possible for the next chapters.
