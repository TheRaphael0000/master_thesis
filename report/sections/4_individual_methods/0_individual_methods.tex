\section{Individual rank lists methods}

In this chapter, the goal is to find individual methods which yield good rank list for the authorship verification task.
Two main types of rank list are created, one using the most frequent (MF) approach and another one using compression based techniques.

For the most frequent approach, three texts representations are explored.

For each method, the parameter that give the best results over the three corpora are retained and summerized at the end of this chapter.
