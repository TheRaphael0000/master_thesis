\section{Individual rank lists methods}

In this chapter, the goal is to find individual methods which yield good rank list for the authorship verification task.

The method adopted was to compare document using the authorship linkings strategies presented in \textit{Evaluation of text representation schemes and distance measures for authorship linking}~\cite{kocher_verification}.
The strategy used in this paper is based on the most frequent (MF) approach.
This method aim to compare the simlarity of documents by considering reccurent stylistic textual patterns.
Text patterns can be for example from either reccurant words, short sequences of characters (known as n-grams) or Part-Of-Speech (POS).

Another possible method is to compare similarities between document with compression techniques.
This method is also slightly explored in this study.

For each method, the parameters that give the best results over the three corpora are retained and summerized at the end of this chapter.
The main objective is to have the most reliable authorship linking rank list possible for the next chapters.
