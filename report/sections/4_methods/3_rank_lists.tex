\subsection{Rank lists}

Rank lists are used to order objects such that the most interesting object is at the top and every subsequent object become less interesting.
In information retrival systems, rank lists are used to order the results from the most relevant to the user's query to the least relevant.

\begin{definition}[Ranked list for authorship verification]
  A ranked list is a ordered list containing pairs of document.
  In most cases, the rank list contain every possible pairs of documents (every links).
  The ranked list is generally ordered by a score which can be either be ascendant in the case of scoring based on distance metrics and descendant when using similarity metrics.
  \begin{equation}
    L = (((X_a, X_b), Score(X_a, X_b)) | X_a \neq X_b \forall (X_a, X_b))
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    |L| = \frac{N \cdot (N - 1)}{2}
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
