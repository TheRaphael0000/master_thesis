\section{Evaluation \label{sec:evaluation}}

This section explain the divers evaluation metrics used and experiments realized on the datasets to evaluate the proposed methods (ref. Section~\ref{sec:methods}).
Each experiment of this section is described by its purpose in the study, the methodology used to conduct it, the results obtained in the form of: graph, table or statistics, an analysis of the results and sometimes a few additional conclusion to the experiment.
The section is seperated into two parts, one concerning the rank lists and another one dedicated to the clustering task.
The experiment realized in this study where written in the Python programming language (version 3.8.8)~\cite{python}, using the following libraries:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Python Standard Library 3.8.8, for the data types, functional programming, file and direcotry access, data compression, text processing~\cite{python_standard_library}
  \item Matplotlib 3.3.4, for the plot generations~\cite{matplotlib}
  \item Numpy 1.20.2, for scientific computations~\cite{numpy}
  \item SciPy 1.4.1, for scientific computations~\cite{scipy}
  \item Scikit-learn 0.24.1, for most machine learning algorithm~\cite{sklearn}
  \item bcubed 1.5, for computing the BCubed family metrics~\cite{bcubed_gh}
  \item adjustText 0.7.3, for automatics text adjustments in plots~\cite{adjustText}
\end{itemize}
