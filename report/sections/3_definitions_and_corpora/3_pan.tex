\subsection{PAN @ CLEF 2016}

During PAN @ CLEF 2016 clustering campaign, a group of corpora was given to the participants.
The corpora was separated in two parts : a training part where 18 clustering problems and solutions were available and a second part with 18 problems without solutions.
The problems are in 3 languages (English, Dutch, Greek) and two genres (articles and reviews)~\cite{pan16}.

Detailed statistics on the corpora can be found in Table~\ref{tab:pan_corpus} in annex.
The $r$ ratio is closer to 1 than 0 for most of the problems, which indicate a rather larger number of single cluster, making the baseline \textit{Singleton Cluster} (metrics evaluated such that each document are considered in a different cluster) a challenging problem to overcome for this datatset.
The mean number of tokens for each problem in corpora is in the range $[142-1533]$, which compared to the literary datasets presented in Section~\ref{sec:lit_corpus} correspond to ~2\%-15\% tokens.
Additionally, the true links' ratio is rather low for all problem which mean without strong comparison metrics, finding the correct true links is even harder, thus Singleton Cluster can give better results with most of the standard approaches.
