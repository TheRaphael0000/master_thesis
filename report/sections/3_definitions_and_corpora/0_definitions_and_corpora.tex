\chapter{Definitions and Corpora \label{sec:definitions_and_corpora}}

In this section, some basic concepts related to the authorship verification, attribution and clustering will be introduced as well as the different corpus used.
Two types of corpus were selected for this study.
Three literary corpora containing excerpts of English (1 corpus) and French (2 corpora) novels.
As well as the ones used for PAN @ CLEF 2016 campaign \cite{pan16}, which contain reviews and articles written in English, Dutch and Greek.
