\chapter{Rank Lists' Fusions \label{sec:fusions}}

To increase the rank lists' quality, the proposed method is to use a combination of multiple rank list to form an optimistically better rank list.
We call this method \textit{fusion} or \textit{rank lists' fusion}.
By using the most diverse strategies, we believe it is possible to increase the rank list quality using the principle of combination of evidences.

In this Chapter, two fusion strategies will be presented.
To evaluate the two fusion schemes, techniques from Section~\ref{sec:evaluation_comparison} are used.

At the end of this Chapter, the rank list produced by fusion will be used to solve the authorship clustering task.
