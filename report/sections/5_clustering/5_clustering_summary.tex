\subsection{Clustering Summary}

Table~\ref{tab:clustering_evaluation_summary} contains a summary of the proposed method to evaluate using the $B^3_{F_1}$ score and the $r_{diff}$.

Each method produces similar results, but the semi-supervised with complete linkage give the best results, $B^3_{F_1} = 0.82$.
When compared to the tweaked unsupervised methods and the supervised method produce slightly worse results.
The non-tweak unsupervised model give the worse results.

The tweaked unsupervised model with average linkage and complete linkage and the semi-supervised with average linkage are the best models to estimate the number of clustersm, $r_{diff} = 0.06$.

Overall the results are close to the upper bound.
