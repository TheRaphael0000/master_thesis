\subsection{Clustering Summary}

Table~\ref{tab:clustering_evaluation_summary} contains a summary of the proposed method to evaluate using the $B^3_{F_1}$ score and the $r_{diff}$.
As observed previously, having an $r_{diff}$ slightly larger than 0, produce better a $B^3_{F_1}$ as shown with the two upper bounds.
Each method produces similar results, but the unsupervised tweak method give the best results.
When compared to the tweaked unsupervised method, the semi-supervised and supervised methods produce slightly worse results.
The non-tweak unsupervised model give the worse results.
If the upper bound, best $B^3_{F_1}$ is considered the best possible clustering for these ranks lists.
The clustering models can be evaluated in terms of $B^3_{F_1}$ completion to the best $B^3_{F_1}$ upper bound (completion: $\frac{score_{model}}{score_{upper bound}}$).
This completion value should reflect the model clustering with a hypothetical perfect rank list, since the upper bound for a perfect rank list should be 1.00.
The unsupervised have a 0.82 $B^3_{F_1}$ completion, the unsupervised tweaked 0.95, the semi-supervised 0.93 and the supervised 0.91.
