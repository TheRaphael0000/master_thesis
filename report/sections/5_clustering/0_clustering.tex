\section{Authorship clustering \label{sec:clustering}}

In this chapter authorship clustering methods will be presented and evaluated.

Authorship clustering aim to regroup documents into clusters.
The best achievable clustering have every same author document in the same cluster and every different author document in a different cluster.

For the clustering part, multiple methods are investigated and proposed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  A full unsupervised clustering, by minimizing intercluster distances and maximizing nearest cluster distance.
  \item
  A semi-supervised clustering technique using previously computed values as a decision point.
  \item
  A supervised clustering technique which takes clues from previous corpora analysis to lead the clustering.
\end{itemize}
