\chapter{Authorship Clustering \label{sec:clustering}}

In this chapter, authorship clustering methods will be presented and evaluated.

Authorship clustering aim to regroup documents into clusters.
The best achievable clustering have every same author document in the same cluster and every different author document in a different cluster.
The quality can be measured with the metrics presented in Section~\ref{sec:clustering_evaluation_meterics}.

For the clustering part, multiple methods based on hierarchical clustering are investigated and proposed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Silhouette-based clustering : A fully unsupervised clustering which aims to minimize the intra-cluster distances and maximize the nearest cluster distance.
  \item
  Distribution-based clustering : A supervised clustering technique which aims to model known corpus rank lists and compute a decision point.
  \item
  Regression-based clustering : A supervised clustering technique which takes clues from previous corpora analysis to lead the clustering.
\end{itemize}
