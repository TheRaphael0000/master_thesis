\section{Contributions}

In this study, the following contributions are made to the computer science computational linguistic scientific community:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  An evaluation of most frequent words frequency feature extraction strategy using : tokens, lemmas, $n$-grams, POS sequences text representation and multiple distance metrics.
  \item
  An brief evaluation of the compression based methods for authorship attribution.
  \item
  An brief evaluation of the mean Silhouette score maximization for unsupervised hierarchical clustering in the authorship use case as well as an optimization proposition for the authorship clustering use case.
  \item
  A proposition and evaluation of a supervised authorship clustering model based on an authorship attribution modelling using a mixture of two beta distribution and hierarchical clustering.
  \item
  A proposition and evaluation of a supervised authorship clustering model based on the logistic regression and the hierarchical clustering.
  \item
  A methodology to create robust rank lists for authorship attribution and authorship clustering, using rank lists' fusions based on combination of evidence.
\end{enumerate}
