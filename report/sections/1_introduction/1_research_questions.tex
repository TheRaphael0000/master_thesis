\section{Research questions}

The main research questions for this study are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  RQ1 : What are some good individual techniques to identify same author documents based on the text style ?
  \item
  RQ2 : What are some good technique for the authorship clustering ?
  \item
  RQ3 : Using the principle of combination of evidence and the methods found in RQ1, can a combination of the results improve the results quality ?
  \item
  RQ4 : Using the authorship clustering models found in RQ2, can the results obtained by RQ3 be better than the ones obtained with RQ1 ?
\end{itemize}

The first research question, is to cherry-pick methods to identify same authors documents pairs and are required for the clustering task.
The second question aim to provide methods to achieve the clustering task.
By answering the third question, we aim to provide a simple framework of combination of results.
With the fourth question, we aim to evaluate if the clustering obtained by using a combination of result is better than each individual clustering.
