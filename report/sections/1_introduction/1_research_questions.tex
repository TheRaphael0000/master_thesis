\section{Research questions}

The main research questions for this study are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  What are the best individual methods based on the text style to achieve authorship verification ?
  \item
  Using the principle of combination of evidence on the best individual methods, can the authorship rank lists' fusion improve the quality of rank lists ?
  \item
  Can the authorship clustering using rank lists obtained by fusion be better than the individual methods ?
\end{enumerate}

The first research question, is to cherry-pick methods to identify same authors documents pairs and is required for the clustering task.
By answering the second question, this provides a simple framework that can be used in multiple fields using rank lists such as the information retrieval, recommender systems, authorship attribution, authorship clustering and most classification problems based on complete graphs.
With the third question, we aim to evaluate a possible use case for the rank lists' fusion by realizing an authorship clustering task with the obtained rank lists.
