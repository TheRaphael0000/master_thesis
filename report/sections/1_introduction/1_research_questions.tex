\section{Research Questions}

The main research questions for this study are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[RQ1]
  What are good individual techniques to identify same author documents based on the text style?
  \item[RQ2]
  How effective are techniques for authorship clustering?
  \item[RQ3]
  Using the principle of combination of evidence and the methods found in RQ1, can a combined strategy improve the effectiveness of the solution?
  \item[RQ4]
  Using the authorship clustering models found in RQ2, can the results obtained by RQ3 be better than the ones obtained with RQ1?
\end{enumerate}

The first research question evaluates a wide range of possible methods and then fine tune the best approaches to identify pairs of documents written by the same author.
The second question aim to provide methods to achieve the clustering task.
By answering the third question, we aim to provide a simple framework for combining individual methods.
With the fourth question, we aim to evaluate if the clustering obtained by using a combination of results is better than each individual clustering.
