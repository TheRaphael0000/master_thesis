\section{Overview}

An overview of the current technique used in the authorship field is presented in Chapter~\ref{sec:state_of_the_art}.
Chapter~\ref{sec:definitions_and_corpora} show definitions and introduce the corpora used for the evaluations.
In Chapter~\ref{sec:individual_methods} individual methods to create rank lists are described.
This section encompasses methods for the rank generations using the author style and compression techniques.
The methods proposed in the previous section are used for the clustering task in Chapter~\ref{sec:clustering}.
Chapter~\ref{sec:fusions} explain rank lists' fusions approaches and evaluate them.
At the end of this chapter, the clustering methods are evaluated using the fused rank list to try to obtain the best possible clustering for each corpus.
Finally, Chapter~\ref{sec:conclusion} conclude this paper by reviewing experiments results and indicate the potential clues to continue the study.
