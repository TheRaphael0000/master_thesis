\section{Overview}

An overview of the current technique used in the authorship field is presented in Chapter~\ref{sec:state_of_the_art}.
Chapter~\ref{sec:definitions_and_corpora} shows definitions and introduces the corpora used for the evaluations.
In Chapter~\ref{sec:individual_methods} individual methods to create rank lists are described.
This chapter encompasses methods to generate rank lists, using stylometric clues and compression techniques.
The methods proposed in the previous chapter are used for the clustering task in Chapter~\ref{sec:clustering}.
Chapter~\ref{sec:fusions} explain rank lists' fusions approaches and evaluate them.
At the end of this chapter, the clustering methods are evaluated using the fused rank list to hopefully obtain the best possible clustering for each corpus.
Finally, Chapter~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes this study by reviewing experiments results and indicate the potential clues to continue the study.
