supper
had
been
extremely
gay
.
all
those
present
declared
that
never
had
lady
blakeney
been
more
adorable
,
nor
that
"
demmed
idiot
"
sir
percy
more
amusing
.
his
royal
highness
had
laughed
until
the
tears
streamed
down
his
cheeks
at
blakeney
'
s
foolish
yet
funny
repartees
.
his
doggerel
verse
,
"
we
seek
him
here
,
we
seek
him
there
,
"
etc
.
,
was
sung
to
the
tune
of
"
ho
!
merry
britons
!
"
and
to
the
accompaniment
of
glasses
knocked
loudly
against
the
table
.
lord
grenville
,
moreover
,
had
a
most
perfect
cook
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
some
wags
asserted
that
he
was
a
scion
of
the
old
french
noblesse
,
who
having
lost
his
fortune
,
had
come
to
seek
it
in
the
cuisine
of
the
foreign
office
.
marguerite
blakeney
was
in
her
most
brilliant
mood
,
and
surely
not
a
soul
in
that
crowded
supper
-
room
had
even
an
inkling
of
the
terrible
struggle
which
was
raging
within
her
heart
.
the
clock
was
ticking
so
mercilessly
on
.
it
was
long
past
midnight
,
and
even
the
prince
of
wales
was
thinking
of
leaving
the
supper
-
table
.
within
the
next
half
-
hour
the
destinies
of
two
brave
men
would
be
pitted
against
one
another
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
dearly
-
beloved
brother
and
he
,
the
unknown
hero
.
marguerite
had
not
tried
to
see
chauvelin
during
this
last
hour
;
she
knew
that
his
keen
,
fox
-
like
eyes
would
terrify
her
at
once
,
and
incline
the
balance
of
her
decision
towards
armand
.
whilst
she
did
not
see
him
,
there
still
lingered
in
her
heart
of
hearts
a
vague
,
undefined
hope
that
"
something
"
would
occur
,
something
big
,
enormous
,
epoch
-
making
,
which
would
shift
from
her
young
,
weak
shoulders
this
terrible
burden
of
responsibility
,
of
having
to
choose
between
two
such
cruel
alternatives
.
but
the
minutes
ticked
on
with
that
dull
monotony
which
they
invariably
seem
to
assume
when
our
very
nerves
ache
with
their
incessant
ticking
.
after
supper
,
dancing
was
resumed
.
his
royal
highness
had
left
,
and
there
was
general
talk
of
departing
among
the
older
guests
;
the
young
were
indefatigable
and
had
started
on
a
new
gavotte
,
which
would
fill
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
.
marguerite
did
not
feel
equal
to
another
dance
;
there
is
a
limit
to
the
most
enduring
of
self
-
control
.
escorted
by
a
cabinet
minister
,
she
had
once
more
found
her
way
to
the
tiny
boudoir
,
still
the
most
deserted
among
all
the
rooms
.
she
knew
that
chauvelin
must
be
lying
in
wait
for
her
somewhere
,
ready
to
seize
the
first
possible
opportunity
for
a
tete
-
a
-
tete
.
his
eyes
had
met
hers
for
a
moment
after
the
`
fore
-
supper
minuet
,
and
she
knew
that
the
keen
diplomat
,
with
those
searching
pale
eyes
of
his
,
had
divined
that
her
work
was
accomplished
.
fate
had
willed
it
so
.
marguerite
,
torn
by
the
most
terrible
conflict
heart
of
woman
can
ever
know
,
had
resigned
herself
to
its
decrees
.
but
armand
must
be
saved
at
any
cost
;
he
,
first
of
all
,
for
he
was
her
brother
,
had
been
mother
,
father
,
friend
to
her
ever
since
she
,
a
tiny
babe
,
had
lost
both
her
parents
.
to
think
of
armand
dying
a
traitor
'
s
death
on
the
guillotine
was
too
horrible
even
to
dwell
upon
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
impossible
in
fact
.
that
could
never
be
,
never
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
for
the
stranger
,
the
hero
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
well
!
there
,
let
fate
decide
.
marguerite
would
redeem
her
brother
'
s
life
at
the
hands
of
the
relentless
enemy
,
then
let
that
cunning
scarlet
pimpernel
extricate
himself
after
that
.
perhaps
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
vaguely
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
marguerite
hoped
that
the
daring
plotter
,
who
for
so
many
months
had
baffled
an
army
of
spies
,
would
still
manage
to
evade
chauvelin
and
remain
immune
to
the
end
.
she
thought
of
all
this
,
as
she
sat
listening
to
the
witty
discourse
of
the
cabinet
minister
,
who
,
no
doubt
,
felt
that
he
had
found
in
lady
blakeney
a
most
perfect
listener
.
suddenly
she
saw
the
keen
,
fox
-
like
face
of
chauvelin
peeping
through
the
curtained
doorway
.
"
lord
fancourt
,
"
she
said
to
the
minister
,
"
will
you
do
me
a
service
?
"
"
i
am
entirely
at
your
ladyship
'
s
service
,
"
he
replied
gallantly
.
"
will
you
see
if
my
husband
is
still
in
the
card
-
room
?
and
if
he
is
,
will
you
tell
him
that
i
am
very
tired
,
and
would
be
glad
to
go
home
soon
.
"
the
commands
of
a
beautiful
woman
are
binding
on
all
mankind
,
even
on
cabinet
ministers
.
lord
fancourt
prepared
to
obey
instantly
.
"
i
do
not
like
to
leave
your
ladyship
alone
,
"
he
said
.
"
never
fear
.
i
shall
be
quite
safe
here
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
,
i
think
,
undisturbed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
i
am
really
tired
.
you
know
sir
percy
will
drive
back
to
richmond
.
it
is
a
long
way
,
and
we
shall
not
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
an
we
do
not
hurry
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
get
home
before
daybreak
.
"
lord
fancourt
had
perforce
to
go
.
the
moment
he
had
disappeared
,
chauvelin
slipped
into
the
room
,
and
the
next
instant
stood
calm
and
impassive
by
her
side
.
"
you
have
news
for
me
?
"
he
said
.
an
icy
mantle
seemed
to
have
suddenly
settled
round
marguerite
'
s
shoulders
;
though
her
cheeks
glowed
with
fire
,
she
felt
chilled
and
numbed
.
oh
,
armand
!
will
you
ever
know
the
terrible
sacrifice
of
pride
,
of
dignity
,
of
womanliness
a
devoted
sister
is
making
for
your
sake
?
"
nothing
of
importance
,
"
she
said
,
staring
mechanically
before
her
,
"
but
it
might
prove
a
clue
.
i
contrived
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
no
matter
how
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
detect
sir
andrew
ffoulkes
in
the
very
act
of
burning
a
paper
at
one
of
these
candles
,
in
this
very
room
.
that
paper
i
succeeded
in
holding
between
my
fingers
for
the
space
of
two
minutes
,
and
to
cast
my
eyes
on
it
for
that
of
ten
seconds
.
"
"
time
enough
to
learn
its
contents
?
"
asked
chauvelin
,
quietly
.
she
nodded
.
then
continued
in
the
same
even
,
mechanical
tone
of
voice
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
in
the
corner
of
the
paper
there
was
the
usual
rough
device
of
a
small
star
-
shaped
flower
.
above
it
i
read
two
lines
,
everything
else
was
scorched
and
blackened
by
the
flame
.
"
"
and
what
were
the
two
lines
?
"
her
throat
seemed
suddenly
to
have
contracted
.
for
an
instant
she
felt
that
she
could
not
speak
the
words
,
which
might
send
a
brave
man
to
his
death
.
"
it
is
lucky
that
the
whole
paper
was
not
burned
,
"
added
chauvelin
,
with
dry
sarcasm
,
"
for
it
might
have
fared
ill
with
armand
st
.
just
.
what
were
the
two
lines
citoyenne
?
"
"
one
was
,
`
i
start
myself
to
-
morrow
,
'
"
she
said
quietly
,
"
the
other
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
'
if
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
,
i
shall
be
in
the
supper
-
room
at
one
o
'
clock
precisely
.
'
"
chauvelin
looked
up
at
the
clock
just
above
the
mantelpiece
.
"
then
i
have
plenty
of
time
,
"
he
said
placidly
.
"
what
are
you
going
to
do
?
"
she
asked
.
she
was
pale
as
a
statue
,
her
hands
were
icy
cold
,
her
head
and
heart
throbbed
with
the
awful
strain
upon
her
nerves
.
oh
,
this
was
cruel
!
cruel
!
what
had
she
done
to
have
deserved
all
this
?
her
choice
was
made
:
had
she
done
a
vile
action
or
one
that
was
sublime
?
the
recording
angel
,
who
writes
in
the
book
of
gold
,
alone
could
give
an
answer
.
"
what
are
you
going
to
do
?
"
she
repeated
mechanically
.
"
oh
,
nothing
for
the
present
.
after
that
it
will
depend
.
"
"
on
what
?
"
"
on
whom
i
shall
see
in
the
supper
-
room
at
one
o
'
clock
precisely
.
"
"
you
will
see
the
scarlet
pimpernel
,
of
course
.
but
you
do
not
know
him
.
"
"
no
.
but
i
shall
presently
.
"
"
sir
andrew
will
have
warned
him
.
"
"
i
think
not
.
when
you
parted
from
him
after
the
minuet
he
stood
and
watched
you
,
for
a
moment
or
two
,
with
a
look
which
gave
me
to
understand
that
something
had
happened
between
you
.
it
was
only
natural
,
was
it
not
?
that
i
should
make
a
shrewd
guess
as
to
the
nature
of
that
`
something
.
'
i
thereupon
engaged
the
young
man
in
a
long
and
animated
conversation
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
we
discussed
herr
gluck
'
s
singular
success
in
london
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
until
a
lady
claimed
his
arm
for
supper
.
"
"
since
then
?
"
"
i
did
not
lose
sight
of
him
through
supper
.
when
we
all
came
upstairs
again
,
lady
portarles
buttonholed
him
and
started
on
the
subject
of
pretty
mlle
.
suzanne
de
tournay
.
i
knew
he
would
not
move
until
lady
portarles
had
exhausted
on
the
subject
,
which
will
not
be
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
at
least
,
and
it
is
five
minutes
to
one
now
.
"
he
was
preparing
to
go
,
and
went
up
to
the
doorway
where
,
drawing
aside
the
curtain
,
he
stood
for
a
moment
pointing
out
to
marguerite
the
distant
figure
of
sir
andrew
ffoulkes
in
close
conversation
with
lady
portarles
.
"
i
think
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
triumphant
smile
,
"
that
i
may
safely
expect
to
find
the
person
i
seek
in
the
dining
-
room
,
fair
lady
.
"
"
there
may
be
more
than
one
.
"
"
whoever
is
there
,
as
the
clock
strikes
one
,
will
be
shadowed
by
one
of
my
men
;
of
these
,
one
,
or
perhaps
two
,
or
even
three
,
will
leave
for
france
to
-
morrow
.
one
of
these
will
be
the
`
scarlet
pimpernel

"
"
yes
?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
?
"
"
i
also
,
fair
lady
,
will
leave
for
france
to
-
morrow
.
the
papers
found
at
dover
upon
the
person
of
sir
andrew
ffoulkes
speak
of
the
neighborhood
of
calais
,
of
an
inn
which
i
know
well
,
called
`
le
chat
gris
,
'
of
a
lonely
place
somewhere
on
the
coast
.
.

.
.
.
.
the
pere
blanchard

s
hut

.
.
.
.
.
.
which
i
must
endeavor
to
find

all
these
places
are
given
as
the
point
where
this
meddlesome
englishman
has
bidden
the
traitor
de
tournay
and
others
to
meet
his
emissaries
.
but
it
seems
that
he
has
decided
not
to
send
his
emissaries
,
that
`
he
will
start
himself
to
-
morrow
.
'
now
,
one
of
these
persons
whom
i
shall
see
anon
in
the
supper
-
room
,
will
be
journeying
to
calais
,
and
i
shall
follow
that
person

until
i
have
tracked
him
to
where
those
fugitive
aristocrats
await
him
;
for
that
person

will
be
the
man

sought
for
,
for
nearly
a
year

the
man

energies
has
outdone

baffled

set
me
wondering

me

who
have
seen

the
mysterious
and
elusive
scarlet
pimpernel

"
and
armand
?

she
pleaded
.

i
ever
broken
my
word

i
promise
you
that
the
day
the

more
than

pledge

that

meddlesome
englishman

be
here

safe
in

sister

"
and
with
a
deep
and
elaborate
bow
and
another
look
at
the
clock
,
chauvelin
glided
out
of
the
room
.
it
seemed
to
marguerite
that
through
all
the
noise
,
all
the
din
of
music
,
dancing
,
and
laughter
,
she
could
hear
his
cat
-
like
tread
,
gliding
through
the
vast
reception
-
rooms
;
that
she
could
hear
him
go
down
the
massive
staircase
,
reach
the
dining
-
room
and
open
the
door
.
fate
had
decided
,
had
made
her
speak
,
had
made
her
do
a
vile
and
abominable
thing
,
for
the
sake
of
the
brother
she
loved
.
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
,
passive
and
still
,
seeing
the
figure
of
her
relentless
enemy
ever
present
before
her
aching
eyes
.
when
chauvelin
reached
the
supper
-
room
it
was
quite
deserted
.
it
had
that
woebegone
,
forsaken
,
tawdry
appearance
,
which
reminds
one
so
much
of
a
ball
-
dress
,
the
morning
after
.
half
-
empty
glasses
littered
the
table
,
unfolded
napkins
lay
about
,
the
chairs
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
turned
towards
one
another
in
groups
of
twos
and
threes
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
very
close
to
one
another
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
the
far
corners
of
the
room
,
which
spoke
of
recent
whispered
flirtations
,
over
cold
game
-
pie
and
champagne
;
there
were
sets
of
three
and
four
chairs
,
that
recalled
pleasant
,
animated
discussions
over
the
latest
scandal
;
there
were
chairs
straight
up
in
a
row
that
still
looked
starchy
,
critical
,
acid
,
like
antiquated
dowager
;
there
were
a
few
isolated
,
single
chairs
,
close
to
the
table
,
that
spoke
of
gourmands
intent
on
the
most
recherche
dishes
,
and
others
overturned
on
the
floor
,
that
spoke
volumes
on
the
subject
of
my
lord
grenville
'
s
cellars
.
it
was
a
ghostlike
replica
,
in
fact
,
of
that
fashionable
gathering
upstairs
;
a
ghost
that
haunts
every
house
where
balls
and
good
suppers
are
given
;
a
picture
drawn
with
white
chalk
on
grey
cardboard
,
dull
and
colourless
,
now
that
the
bright
silk
dresses
and
gorgeously
embroidered
coats
were
no
longer
there
to
fill
in
the
foreground
,
and
now
that
the
candles
flickered
sleepily
in
their
sockets
.
chauvelin
smiled
benignly
,
and
rubbing
his
long
,
thin
hands
together
,
he
looked
round
the
deserted
supper
-
room
,
whence
even
the
last
flunkey
had
retired
in
order
to
join
his
friends
in
the
hall
below
.
all
was
silence
in
the
dimly
-
lighted
room
,
whilst
the
sound
of
the
gavotte
,
the
hum
of
distant
talk
and
laughter
,
and
the
rumble
of
an
occasional
coach
outside
,
only
seemed
to
reach
this
palace
of
the
sleeping
beauty
as
the
murmur
of
some
flitting
spooks
far
away
.
it
all
looked
so
peaceful
,
so
luxurious
,
and
so
still
,
that
the
keenest
observer
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
veritable
prophet
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
could
never
have
guessed
that
,
at
this
present
moment
,
that
deserted
supper
-
room
was
nothing
but
a
trap
laid
for
the
capture
of
the
most
cunning
and
audacious
plotter
those
stirring
times
had
ever
seen
.
chauvelin
pondered
and
tried
to
peer
into
the
immediate
future
.
what
would
this
man
be
like
,
whom
he
and
the
leaders
of
the
whole
revolution
had
sworn
to
bring
to
his
death
?
everything
about
him
was
weird
and
mysterious
;
his
personality
,
which
he
so
cunningly
concealed
,
the
power
he
wielded
over
nineteen
english
gentlemen
who
seemed
to
obey
his
every
command
blindly
and
enthusiastically
,
the
passionate
love
and
submission
he
had
roused
in
his
little
trained
band
,
and
,
above
all
,
his
marvellous
audacity
,
the
boundless
impudence
which
had
caused
him
to
beard
his
most
implacable
enemies
,
within
the
very
walls
of
paris
.
no
wonder
that
in
france
the
sobriquet
of
the
mysterious
englishman
roused
in
the
people
a
superstitious
shudder
.
chauvelin
himself
as
he
gazed
round
the
deserted
room
,
where
presently
the
weird
hero
would
appear
,
felt
a
strange
feeling
of
awe
creeping
all
down
his
spine
.
but
his
plans
were
well
laid
.
he
felt
sure
that
the
scarlet
pimpernel
had
not
been
warned
,
and
felt
equally
sure
that
marguerite
blakeney
had
not
played
him
false
.
if
she
had
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
cruel
look
,
that
would
have
made
her
shudder
,
gleamed
in
chauvelin
'
s
keen
,
pale
eyes
.
if
she
had
played
him
a
trick
,
armand
st
.
just
would
suffer
the
extreme
penalty
.
but
no
,
no
!
of
course
she
had
not
played
him
false
!
fortunately
the
supper
-
room
was
deserted
:
this
would
make
chauvelin
'
s
task
all
the
easier
,
when
presently
that
unsuspecting
enigma
would
enter
it
alone
.
no
one
was
here
now
save
chauvelin
himself
.
stay
!
as
he
surveyed
with
a
satisfied
smile
the
solitude
of
the
room
,
the
cunning
agent
of
the
french
government
became
aware
of
the
peaceful
,
monotonous
breathing
of
some
one
of
my
lord
grenville
'
s
guests
,
who
,
no
doubt
,
had
supped
both
wisely
and
well
,
and
was
enjoying
a
quiet
sleep
,
away
from
the
din
of
the
dancing
above
.
chauvelin
looked
round
once
more
,
and
there
in
the
corner
of
a
sofa
,
in
the
dark
angle
of
the
room
,
his
mouth
open
,
his
eyes
shut
,
the
sweet
sounds
of
peaceful
slumbers
proceedings
from
his
nostrils
,
reclined
the
gorgeously
-
apparelled
,
long
-
limbed
husband
of
the
cleverest
woman
in
europe
.
chauvelin
looked
at
him
as
he
lay
there
,
placid
,
unconscious
,
at
peace
with
all
the
world
and
himself
,
after
the
best
of
suppers
,
and
a
smile
,
that
was
almost
one
of
pity
,
softened
for
a
moment
the
hard
lines
of
the
frenchman
'
s
face
and
the
sarcastic
twinkle
of
his
pale
eyes
.
evidently
the
slumberer
,
deep
in
dreamless
sleep
,
would
not
interfere
with
chauvelin
'
s
trap
for
catching
that
cunning
scarlet
pimpernel
.
again
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
,
and
,
following
the
example
of
sir
percy
blakeney
,
he
too
,
stretched
himself
out
in
the
corner
of
another
sofa
,
shut
his
eyes
,
opened
his
mouth
,
gave
forth
sounds
of
peaceful
breathing
,
and
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
waited
!
marguerite
blakeney
had
watched
the
slight
sable
-
clad
figure
of
chauvelin
,
as
he
worked
his
way
through
the
ball
-
room
.
then
perforce
she
had
had
to
wait
,
while
her
nerves
tingled
with
excitement
.
listlessly
she
sat
in
the
small
,
still
deserted
boudoir
,
looking
out
through
the
curtained
doorway
on
the
dancing
couples
beyond
:
looking
at
them
,
yet
seeing
nothing
,
hearing
the
music
,
yet
conscious
of
naught
save
a
feeling
of
expectancy
,
of
anxious
,
weary
waiting
.
her
mind
conjured
up
before
her
the
vision
of
what
was
,
perhaps
at
this
very
moment
,
passing
downstairs
.
the
half
-
deserted
dining
-
room
,
the
fateful
hour
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
chauvelin
on
the
watch
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
then
,
precise
to
the
moment
,
the
entrance
of
a
man
,
he
,
the
scarlet
pimpernel
,
the
mysterious
leader
,
who
to
marguerite
had
become
almost
unreal
,
so
strange
,
so
weird
was
this
hidden
identity
.
she
wished
she
were
in
the
supper
-
room
,
too
,
at
this
moment
,
watching
him
as
he
entered
;
she
knew
that
her
woman
'
s
penetration
would
at
once
recognise
in
the
stranger
'
s
face
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
whoever
he
might
be
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
strong
individuality
which
belongs
to
a
leader
of
men
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
a
hero
:
to
the
mighty
,
high
-
soaring
eagle
,
whose
daring
wings
were
becoming
entangled
in
the
ferret
'
s
trap
.
woman
-
like
,
she
thought
of
him
with
unmixed
sadness
;
the
irony
of
that
fate
seemed
so
cruel
which
allowed
the
fearless
lion
to
succumb
to
the
gnawing
of
a
rat
!
ah
!
had
armand
'
s
life
not
been
at
stake
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
faith
!
your
ladyship
must
have
thought
me
very
remiss
,
"
said
a
voice
suddenly
,
close
to
her
elbow
.
"
i
had
a
deal
of
difficulty
in
delivering
your
message
,
for
i
could
not
find
blakeney
anywhere
at
first
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
marguerite
had
forgotten
all
about
her
husband
and
her
message
to
him
;
his
very
name
,
as
spoken
by
lord
fancourt
,
sounded
strange
and
unfamiliar
to
her
,
so
completely
had
she
in
the
last
five
minutes
lived
her
old
life
in
the
rue
de
richelieu
again
,
with
armand
always
near
her
to
love
and
protect
her
,
to
guard
her
from
the
many
subtle
intrigues
which
were
forever
raging
in
paris
in
those
days
.
"
i
did
find
him
at
last
,
"
continued
lord
fancourt
,
"
and
gave
him
your
message
.
he
said
that
he
would
give
orders
at
once
for
the
horses
to
be
put
to
.
"
"
ah
!
"
she
said
,
still
very
absently
,
"
you
found
my
husband
,
and
gave
him
my
message
?
"
"
yes
;
he
was
in
the
dining
-
room
fast
asleep
.
i
could
not
manage
to
wake
him
up
at
first
.
"
"
thank
you
very
much
,
"
she
said
mechanically
,
trying
to
collect
her
thoughts
.
"
will
your
ladyship
honour
me
with
the
contredanse
until
your
coach
is
ready
?
"
asked
lord
fancourt
.
"
no
,
i
thank
you
,
my
lord
,
but
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
you
will
forgive
me
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
really
am
too
tired
,
and
the
heat
in
the
ball
-
room
has
become
oppressive
.
"
"
the
conservatory
is
deliciously
cool
;
let
me
take
you
there
,
and
then
get
you
something
.
you
seem
ailing
,
lady
blakeney
.
"
"
i
am
only
very
tired
,
"
she
repeated
wearily
,
as
she
allowed
lord
fancourt
to
lead
her
,
where
subdued
lights
and
green
plants
lent
coolness
to
the
air
.
he
got
her
a
chair
,
into
which
she
sank
.
this
long
interval
of
waiting
was
intolerable
.
why
did
not
chauvelin
come
and
tell
her
the
result
of
his
watch
?
lord
fancourt
was
very
attentive
.
she
scarcely
heard
what
he
said
,
and
suddenly
startled
him
by
asking
abruptly
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
lord
fancourt
,
did
you
perceive
who
was
in
the
dining
-
room
just
now
besides
sir
percy
blakeney
?
"
"
only
the
agent
of
the
french
government
,
m
.
chauvelin
,
equally
fast
asleep
in
another
corner
,
"
he
said
.
"
why
does
your
ladyship
ask
?
"
"
i
know
not
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
.
.
.
.
.
.
did
you
notice
the
time
when
you
were
there
?
"
"
it
must
have
been
about
five
or
ten
minutes
past
one
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
wonder
what
your
ladyship
is
thinking
about
,
"
he
added
,
for
evidently
the
fair
lady
'
s
thoughts
were
very
far
away
,
and
she
had
not
been
listening
to
his
intellectual
conversation
.
but
indeed
her
thoughts
were
not
very
far
away
:
only
one
storey
below
,
in
this
same
house
,
in
the
dining
-
room
where
sat
chauvelin
still
on
the
watch
.
had
he
failed
?
for
one
instant
that
possibility
rose
before
as
a
hope
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
hope
that
the
scarlet
pimpernel
had
been
warned
by
sir
andrew
,
and
that
chauvelin
'
s
trap
had
failed
to
catch
his
bird
;
but
that
hope
soon
gave
way
to
fear
.
had
he
failed
?
but
then
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
armand
!
lord
fancourt
had
given
up
talking
since
he
found
that
he
had
no
listener
.
he
wanted
an
opportunity
for
slipping
away
;
for
sitting
opposite
to
a
lady
,
however
fair
,
who
is
evidently
not
heeding
the
most
vigorous
efforts
made
for
her
entertainment
,
is
not
exhilarating
,
even
to
a
cabinet
minister
.
"
shall
i
find
out
if
your
ladyship
'
s
coach
is
ready
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
tentatively
.
"
oh
,
thank
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
thank
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
if
you
would
be
so
kind
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
fear
i
am
but
sorry
company
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
i
am
really
tired
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
,
perhaps
,
would
be
best
alone
.
but
lord
fancourt
went
,
and
still
chauvelin
did
not
come
.
oh
!
what
had
happened
?
she
felt
armand
'
s
fate
trembling
in
the
balance
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
she
feared
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
now
with
a
deadly
fear
that
chauvelin
had
failed
,
and
that
the
mysterious
scarlet
pimpernel
had
proved
elusive
once
more
;
then
she
knew
that
she
need
hope
for
no
pity
,
no
mercy
,
from
him
.
he
had
pronounced
his
"
either
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
or
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
and
nothing
less
would
content
him
:
he
was
very
spiteful
,
and
would
affect
the
belief
that
she
had
wilfully
misled
him
,
and
having
failed
to
trap
the
eagle
once
again
,
his
revengeful
mind
would
be
content
with
the
humble
prey
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
armand
!
yet
she
had
done
her
best
;
had
strained
every
nerve
for
armand
'
s
sake
.
she
could
not
bear
to
think
that
all
had
failed
.
she
could
not
sit
still
;
she
wanted
to
go
and
hear
the
worst
at
once
;
she
wondered
even
that
chauvelin
had
not
come
yet
,
to
vent
his
wrath
and
satire
upon
her
.
lord
grenville
himself
came
presently
to
tell
her
that
her
coach
was
ready
,
and
that
sir
percy
was
already
waiting
for
her
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
ribbons
in
hand
.
marguerite
said
"
farewell
"
to
her
distinguished
host
;
many
of
her
friends
stopped
her
,
as
she
crossed
the
rooms
,
to
talk
to
her
,
and
exchange
pleasant
au
revoirs
.
the
minister
only
took
final
leave
of
beautiful
lady
blakeney
on
the
top
of
the
stairs
;
below
,
on
the
landing
,
a
veritable
army
of
gallant
gentlemen
were
waiting
to
bid
"
good
-
bye
"
to
the
queen
of
beauty
and
fashion
,
whilst
outside
,
under
the
massive
portico
,
sir
percy
'
s
magnificent
bays
were
impatient
pawing
the
ground
.
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
just
after
she
had
taken
final
leave
of
her
host
,
she
suddenly
say
chauvelin
;
he
was
coming
up
the
stairs
slowly
,
and
rubbing
his
thin
hands
very
softly
together
.
there
was
a
curious
look
on
his
mobile
face
,
partly
amused
and
wholly
puzzled
,
as
his
keen
eyes
met
marguerite
'
s
they
became
strangely
sarcastic
.
"
m
.
chauvelin
,
"
she
said
,
as
he
stopped
on
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
bowing
elaborately
before
her
,
"
my
coach
is
outside
;
may
i
claim
your
arm
?
"
as
gallant
as
ever
,
he
offered
her
his
arm
and
led
her
downstairs
.
the
crowd
was
very
great
,
some
of
the
minister
'
s
guests
were
departing
,
others
were
leaning
against
the
banisters
watching
the
throng
as
it
filed
up
and
down
the
wide
staircase
.
"
chauvelin
,
"
she
said
at
last
desperately
,
"
i
must
know
what
has
happened
.
"
"
what
has
happened
,
dear
lady
?
"
he
said
,
with
affected
surprise
.
"
where
?
when
?
"
"
you
are
torturing
me
,
chauvelin
.
i
have
helped
you
to
-
night
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
surely
i
have
the
right
to
know
.
what
happened
in
the
dining
-
room
at
one
o
'
clock
just
now
?
"
she
spoke
in
a
whisper
,
trusting
that
in
the
general
hubbub
of
the
crowd
her
words
would
remain
unheeded
by
all
,
save
the
man
at
her
side
.
"
quiet
and
peace
reigned
supreme
,
fair
lady
;
at
that
hour
i
was
asleep
in
one
corner
of
one
sofa
and
sir
percy
blakeney
in
another
.
"
"
nobody
came
into
the
room
at
all
?
"
"
nobody
.
"
"
then
we
have
failed
,
you
and
i
?
"
"
yes
!
we
have
failed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
perhaps
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
but
armand
?
"
she
pleaded
.
"
ah
!
armand
st
.
just
'
s
chances
hang
on
a
thread
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
pray
heaven
,
dear
lady
,
that
that
thread
may
not
snap

"
chauvelin

i
worked
for
you
,
sincerely
,
earnestly

remember

"
"
i
remember
my
promise
,
"
he
said
quietly
.
"
the
day
that
the
scarlet
pimpernel
and
i
meet
on
french
soil
,
st
.
just
will
be
in
the
arms
of
his
charming
sister
.
"
"
which
means
that
a
brave
man
'
s
blood
will
be
on
my
hands
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
shudder
.
"
his
blood
,
or
that
of
your
brother
.
surely
at
the
present
moment
you
must
hope
,
as
i
do
,
that
the
enigmatical
scarlet
pimpernel
will
start
for
calais
to
-
day
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
i
am
only
conscious
of
one
hope
,
citoyen
.
"
"
and
that
is
?
"
"
that
satan
,
your
master
,
will
have
need
of
you
elsewhere
,
before
the
sun
rises
to
-
day
.
"
"
you
flatter
me
,
citoyenne
.
"
she
had
detained
him
for
a
while
,
mid
-
way
down
the
stairs
,
trying
to
get
at
the
thoughts
which
lay
beyond
that
thin
,
fox
-
like
mask
.
but
chauvelin
remained
urbane
,
sarcastic
,
mysterious
;
not
a
line
betrayed
to
the
poor
,
anxious
woman
whether
she
need
fear
or
whether
she
dared
to
hope
.
downstairs
on
the
landing
she
was
soon
surrounded
.
lady
blakeney
never
stepped
from
any
house
into
her
coach
,
without
an
escort
of
fluttering
human
moths
around
the
dazzling
light
of
her
beauty
.
but
before
she
finally
turned
away
from
chauvelin
,
she
held
out
a
tiny
hand
to
him
,
with
that
pretty
gesture
of
childish
appeal
which
was
essentially
her
own
.
"
give
me
some
hope
,
my
little
chauvelin
,
"
she
pleaded
.
with
perfect
gallantry
he
bowed
over
that
tiny
hand
,
which
looked
so
dainty
and
white
through
the
delicately
transparent
black
lace
mitten
,
and
kissing
the
tips
of
the
rosy
fingers
:
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
pray
heaven
that
the
thread
may
not
snap
,
"
he
repeated
,
with
his
enigmatic
smile
.
and
stepping
aside
,
he
allowed
the
moths
to
flutter
more
closely
round
the
candle
,
and
the
brilliant
throng
of
the
jeunesse
doree
,
eagerly
attentive
to
lady
blakeney
'
s
every
movement
,
hid
the
keen
,
fox
-
like
face
from
her
view
.
a
few
minutes
later
she
was
sitting
,
wrapped
in
cozy
furs
,
near
sir
percy
blakeney
on
the
box
-
seat
of
his
magnificent
coach
,
and
the
four
splendid
bays
had
thundered
down
the
quiet
street
.
the
night
was
warm
in
spite
of
the
gentle
breeze
which
fanned
marguerite
'
s
burning
cheeks
.
soon
london
houses
were
left
behind
,
and
rattling
over
old
hammersmith
bridge
,
sir
percy
was
driving
his
bays
rapidly
towards
richmond
.
the
river
wound
in
and
out
in
its
pretty
delicate
curves
,
looking
like
a
silver
serpent
beneath
the
glittering
rays
of
the
moon
.
long
shadows
from
overhanging
trees
spread
occasional
deep
palls
right
across
the
road
.
the
bays
were
rushing
along
at
breakneck
speed
,
held
but
slightly
back
by
sir
percy
'
s
strong
,
unerring
hands
.
these
nightly
drives
after
balls
and
suppers
in
london
were
a
source
of
perpetual
delight
to
marguerite
,
and
she
appreciated
her
husband
'
s
eccentricity
keenly
,
which
caused
him
to
adopt
this
mode
of
taking
her
home
every
night
,
to
their
beautiful
home
by
the
river
,
instead
of
living
in
a
stuffy
london
house
.
he
loved
driving
his
spirited
horses
along
the
lonely
,
moonlit
roads
,
and
she
loved
to
sit
on
the
box
-
seat
,
with
the
soft
air
of
an
english
late
summer
'
s
night
fanning
her
face
after
the
hot
atmosphere
of
a
ball
or
supper
-
party
.
the
drive
was
not
a
long
one
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
less
than
an
hour
,
sometimes
,
when
the
bays
were
very
fresh
,
and
sir
percy
gave
them
full
rein
.
to
-
night
he
seemed
to
have
a
very
devil
in
his
fingers
,
and
the
coach
seemed
to
fly
along
the
road
,
beside
the
river
.
as
usual
,
he
did
not
speak
to
her
,
but
stared
straight
in
front
of
him
,
the
ribbons
seeming
to
lie
quite
loosely
in
his
slender
,
white
hands
.
marguerite
looked
at
him
tentatively
once
or
twice
;
she
could
see
his
handsome
profile
,
and
one
lazy
eye
,
with
its
straight
fine
brow
and
drooping
heavy
lid
.
the
face
in
the
moonlight
looked
singularly
earnest
,
and
recalled
to
marguerite
'
s
aching
heart
those
happy
days
of
courtship
,
before
he
had
become
the
lazy
nincompoop
,
the
effete
fop
,
whose
life
seemed
spent
in
card
and
supper
rooms
.
but
now
,
in
the
moonlight
,
she
could
not
catch
the
expression
of
the
lazy
blue
eyes
;
she
could
only
see
the
outline
of
the
firm
chin
,
the
corner
of
the
strong
mouth
,
the
well
-
cut
massive
shape
of
the
forehead
;
truly
,
nature
had
meant
well
by
sir
percy
;
his
faults
must
all
be
laid
at
the
door
of
that
poor
,
half
-
crazy
mother
,
and
of
the
distracted
heart
-
broken
father
,
neither
of
whom
had
cared
for
the
young
life
which
was
sprouting
up
between
them
,
and
which
,
perhaps
,
their
very
carelessness
was
already
beginning
to
wreck
.
marguerite
suddenly
felt
intense
sympathy
for
her
husband
.
the
moral
crisis
she
had
just
gone
through
made
her
feel
indulgent
towards
the
faults
,
the
delinquencies
,
of
others
.
how
thoroughly
a
human
being
can
be
buffeted
and
overmastered
by
fate
,
had
been
borne
in
upon
her
with
appalling
force
.
had
anyone
told
her
a
week
ago
that
she
would
stoop
to
spy
upon
her
friends
,
that
she
would
betray
a
brave
and
unsuspecting
man
into
the
hands
of
a
relentless
enemy
,
she
would
have
laughed
the
idea
to
scorn
.
yet
she
had
done
these
things
;
anon
,
perhaps
the
death
of
that
brave
man
would
be
at
her
door
,
just
as
two
years
ago
the
marquis
de
st
.
cyr
had
perished
through
a
thoughtless
words
of
hers
;
but
in
that
case
she
was
morally
innocent
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
she
had
meant
no
serious
harm
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
fate
merely
had
stepped
in
.
but
this
time
she
had
done
a
thing
that
obviously
was
base
,
had
done
it
deliberately
,
for
a
motive
which
,
perhaps
,
high
moralists
would
not
even
appreciate
.
as
she
felt
her
husband
'
s
strong
arm
beside
her
,
she
also
felt
how
much
more
he
would
dislike
and
despise
her
,
if
he
knew
of
this
night
'
s
work
.
thus
human
beings
judge
of
one
another
,
with
but
little
reason
,
and
no
charity
.
she
despised
her
husband
for
his
inanities
and
vulgar
,
unintellectual
occupations
;
and
he
,
she
felt
,
would
despise
her
still
worse
,
because
she
had
not
been
strong
enough
to
do
right
for
right
'
s
sake
,
and
to
sacrifice
her
brother
to
the
dictates
of
her
conscience
.
buried
in
her
thoughts
,
marguerite
had
found
this
hour
in
the
breezy
summer
night
all
too
brief
;
and
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
keen
disappointment
,
that
she
suddenly
realised
that
the
bays
had
turned
into
the
massive
gates
of
her
beautiful
english
home
.
sir
percy
blakeney
'
s
house
on
the
river
has
become
a
historic
one
:
palatial
in
its
dimensions
,
it
stands
in
the
midst
of
exquisitely
laid
-
out
gardens
,
with
a
picturesque
terrace
and
frontage
to
the
river
.
built
in
tudor
days
,
the
old
red
brick
of
the
walls
looks
eminently
picturesque
in
the
midst
of
a
bower
of
green
,
the
beautiful
lawn
,
with
its
old
sun
-
dial
,
adding
the
true
note
of
harmony
to
its
foregrounds
,
and
now
,
on
this
warm
early
autumn
night
,
the
leaves
slightly
turned
to
russets
and
gold
,
the
old
garden
looked
singularly
poetic
and
peaceful
in
the
moonlight
.
with
unerring
precision
,
sir
percy
had
brought
the
four
bays
to
a
standstill
immediately
in
front
of
the
fine
elizabethan
entrance
hall
;
in
spite
of
the
late
hour
,
an
army
of
grooms
seemed
to
have
emerged
from
the
very
ground
,
as
the
coach
had
thundered
up
,
and
were
standing
respectfully
round
.
sir
percy
jumped
down
quickly
,
then
helped
marguerite
to
alight
.
she
lingered
outside
a
moment
,
whilst
he
gave
a
few
orders
to
one
of
his
men
.
she
skirted
the
house
,
and
stepped
on
to
the
lawn
,
looking
out
dreamily
into
the
silvery
landscape
.
nature
seemed
exquisitely
at
peace
,
in
comparison
with
the
tumultuous
emotions
she
had
gone
through
:
she
could
faintly
hear
the
ripple
of
the
river
and
the
occasional
soft
and
ghostlike
fall
of
a
dead
leaf
from
a
tree
.
all
else
was
quiet
round
her
.
she
had
heard
the
horses
prancing
as
they
were
being
led
away
to
their
distant
stables
,
the
hurrying
of
servant
'
s
feet
as
they
had
all
gone
within
to
rest
:
the
house
also
was
quite
still
.
in
two
separate
suites
of
apartments
,
just
above
the
magnificent
reception
-
rooms
,
lights
were
still
burning
,
they
were
her
rooms
,
and
his
,
well
divided
from
each
other
by
the
whole
width
of
the
house
,
as
far
apart
as
their
own
lives
had
become
.
involuntarily
she
sighed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
at
that
moment
she
could
really
not
have
told
why
.
she
was
suffering
from
unconquerable
heartache
.
deeply
and
achingly
she
was
sorry
for
herself
.
never
had
she
felt
so
pitiably
lonely
,
so
bitterly
in
want
of
comfort
and
of
sympathy
.
with
another
sigh
she
turned
away
from
the
river
towards
the
house
,
vaguely
wondering
if
,
after
such
a
night
,
she
could
ever
find
rest
and
sleep
.
suddenly
,
before
she
reached
the
terrace
,
she
heard
a
firm
step
upon
the
crisp
gravel
,
and
the
next
moment
her
husband
'
s
figure
emerged
out
of
the
shadow
.
he
too
,
had
skirted
the
house
,
and
was
wandering
along
the
lawn
,
towards
the
river
.
he
still
wore
his
heavy
driving
coat
with
the
numerous
lapels
and
collars
he
himself
had
set
in
fashion
,
but
he
had
thrown
it
well
back
,
burying
his
hands
as
was
his
wont
,
in
the
deep
pockets
of
his
satin
breeches
:
the
gorgeous
white
costume
he
had
worn
at
lord
grenville
'
s
ball
,
with
its
jabot
of
priceless
lace
,
looked
strangely
ghostly
against
the
dark
background
of
the
house
.
he
apparently
did
not
notice
her
,
for
,
after
a
few
moments
pause
,
he
presently
turned
back
towards
the
house
,
and
walked
straight
up
to
the
terrace
.
"
sir
percy
!
"
he
already
had
one
foot
on
the
lowest
of
the
terrace
steps
,
but
at
her
voice
he
started
,
and
paused
,
then
looked
searchingly
into
the
shadows
whence
she
had
called
to
him
.
she
came
forward
quickly
into
the
moonlight
,
and
,
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
,
he
said
,
with
that
air
of
consummate
gallantry
he
always
wore
when
speaking
to
her
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
at
your
service
,
madame
!
"
but
his
foot
was
still
on
the
step
,
and
in
his
whole
attitude
there
was
a
remote
suggestion
,
distinctly
visible
to
her
,
that
he
wished
to
go
,
and
had
no
desire
for
a
midnight
interview
.
"
the
air
is
deliciously
cool
,
"
she
said
,
"
the
moonlight
peaceful
and
poetic
,
and
the
garden
inviting
.
will
you
not
stay
in
it
awhile
;
the
hour
is
not
yet
late
,
or
is
my
company
so
distasteful
to
you
,
that
you
are
in
a
hurry
to
rid
yourself
of
it
?
"
"
nay
,
madame
,
"
he
rejoined
placidly
,
"
but
`
tis
on
the
other
foot
the
shoe
happens
to
be
,
and
i
will
warrant
you
will
find
the
midnight
air
more
poetic
without
my
company
:
no
doubt
the
sooner
i
remove
the
obstruction
the
better
your
ladyship
will
like
it
.
"
he
turned
once
more
to
go
.
"
i
protest
you
mistake
me
,
sir
percy
,
"
she
said
hurriedly
,
and
drawing
a
little
closer
to
him
;
"
the
estrangement
,
which
alas
!
has
arisen
between
us
,
was
none
of
my
making
,
remember
.
"
"
begad
!
you
must
pardon
me
there
,
madame
!
"
he
protested
coldly
,
"
my
memory
was
always
of
the
shortest
.
"
he
looked
her
straight
in
the
eyes
,
with
that
lazy
non
-
chalance
which
had
become
second
nature
to
him
.
she
returned
his
gaze
for
a
moment
,
then
her
eyes
softened
,
as
she
came
up
quite
close
to
him
,
to
the
foot
of
the
terrace
steps
.
"
of
the
shortest
,
sir
percy
!
faith
!
how
it
must
have
altered
!
was
it
three
years
ago
or
four
that
you
saw
me
for
one
hour
in
paris
,
on
your
way
to
the
east
?
when
you
came
back
two
years
later
you
had
not
forgotten
me
.
"
she
looked
divinely
pretty
as
she
stood
there
in
the
moonlight
,
with
the
fur
-
cloak
sliding
off
her
beautiful
shoulders
,
the
gold
embroidery
on
her
dress
shimmering
around
her
,
her
childlike
blue
eyes
turned
up
fully
at
him
.
he
stood
for
a
moment
,
rigid
and
still
,
but
for
the
clenching
of
his
hand
against
the
stone
balustrade
of
the
terrace
.
"
you
desired
my
presence
,
madame
,
"
he
said
frigidly
.
"
i
take
it
that
it
was
not
with
the
view
to
indulging
in
tender
reminiscences
.
"
his
voice
certainly
was
cold
and
uncompromising
:
his
attitude
before
her
,
stiff
and
unbending
.
womanly
decorum
would
have
suggested
marguerite
should
return
coldness
for
coldness
,
and
should
sweep
past
him
without
another
word
,
only
with
a
curt
nod
of
her
head
:
but
womanly
instinct
suggested
that
she
should
remain
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
keen
instinct
,
which
makes
a
beautiful
woman
conscious
of
her
powers
long
to
bring
to
her
knees
the
one
man
who
pays
her
no
homage
.
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
him
.
"
nay
,
sir
percy
,
why
not
?
the
present
is
not
so
glorious
but
that
i
should
not
wish
to
dwell
a
little
in
the
past
.
"
he
bent
his
tall
figure
,
and
taking
hold
of
the
extreme
tip
of
the
fingers
which
she
still
held
out
to
him
,
he
kissed
them
ceremoniously
.
"
i
'
faith
,
madame
,
"
he
said
,
"
then
you
will
pardon
me
,
if
my
dull
wits
cannot
accompany
you
there
.
"
once
again
he
attempted
to
go
,
once
more
her
voice
,
sweet
,
childlike
,
almost
tender
,
called
him
back
.
"
sir
percy
.
"
"
your
servant
,
madame
.
"
"
is
it
possible
that
love
can
die
?
"
she
said
with
sudden
,
unreasoning
vehemence
.
"
methought
that
the
passion
which
you
once
felt
for

is
there
nothing
left
of
that
love
,
percy
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
which
might
help
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
bridge
over
that
sad
estrangement
?
"
his
massive
figure
seemed
,
while
she
spoke
thus
to
him
,
to
stiffen
still
more
,
the
strong
mouth
hardened
,
a
look
of
relentless
obstinacy
crept
into
the
habitually
lazy
blue
eyes
.
"
with
what
object
,
i
pray
you
,
madame
?
"
he
asked
coldly
.
"
i
do
not
understand
you
.
"
"
yet
`
tis
simple
enough
,
"
he
said
with
sudden
bitterness
,
which
seemed
literally
to
surge
through
his
words
,
though
he
was
making
visible
efforts
to
suppress
it
,
"
i
humbly
put
the
question
to
you
,
for
my
slow
wits
are
unable
to
grasp
the
cause
of
this
,
your
ladyship
'
s
sudden
new
mood
.
is
it
that
you
have
the
taste
to
renew
the
devilish
sport
which
you
played
so
successfully
last
year
?
do
you
wish
to
see
me
once
more
a
love
-
sick
suppliant
at
your
feet
,
so
that
you
might
again
have
the
pleasure
of
kicking
me
aside
,
like
a
troublesome
lap
-
dog
?
"
she
had
succeeded
in
rousing
him
for
the
moment
:
and
again
she
looked
straight
at
him
,
for
it
was
thus
she
remembered
him
a
year
ago
.
"
percy
!
i
entreat
you
!
"
she
whispered
,
"
can
we
not
bury
the
past
?
"
"
pardon
me
,
madame
,
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
your
desire
was
to
dwell
in
it
.
"
"
nay
!
i
spoke
not
of
that
past
,
percy
!
"
she
said
,
while
a
tone
of
tenderness
crept
into
her
voice
.
"
rather
did
i
speak
of
a
time
when
you
loved
me
still
!
and
i
.
.
.
.
.
.
oh
!
i
was
vain
and
frivolous
;
your
wealth
and
position
allured
me
:
i
married
you
,
hoping
in
my
heart
that
your
great
love
for
me
would
beget
in
me
a
love
for
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
,
alas
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
the
moon
had
sunk
low
down
behind
a
bank
of
clouds
.
in
the
east
a
soft
grey
light
was
beginning
to
chase
away
the
heavy
mantle
of
the
night
.
he
could
only
see
her
graceful
outline
now
,
the
small
queenly
head
,
with
its
wealth
of
reddish
golden
curls
,
and
the
glittering
gems
forming
the
small
,
star
-
shaped
,
red
flower
which
she
wore
as
a
diadem
in
her
hair
.
"
twenty
-
four
hours
after
our
marriage
,
madame
,
the
marquis
de
st
.
cyr
and
all
his
family
perished
on
the
guillotine
,
and
the
popular
rumour
reached
me
that
it
was
the
wife
of
sir
percy
blakeney
who
helped
to
send
them
there
.
"
"
nay
!
i
myself
told
you
the
truth
of
that
odious
tale
.
"
"
not
till
after
it
had
been
recounted
to
me
by
strangers
,
with
all
its
horrible
details
.
"
"
and
you
believed
them
then
and
there
,
"
she
said
with
great
vehemence
,
"
without
a
proof
or
question
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
believed
that
i
,
whom
you
vowed
you
loved
more
than
life
,
whom
you
professed
you
worshipped
,
that
i
could
do
a
thing
so
base
as
these
strangers
chose
to
recount
.
you
thought
i
meant
to
deceive
you
about
it
all
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
i
ought
to
have
spoken
before
i
married
you
:
yet
,
had
you
listened
,
i
would
have
told
you
that
up
to
the
very
morning
on
which
st
.
cyr
went
to
the
guillotine
,
i
was
straining
every
nerve
,
using
every
influence
i
possessed
,
to
save
him
and
his
family
.
but
my
pride
sealed
my
lips
,
when
your
love
seemed
to
perish
,
as
if
under
the
knife
of
that
same
guillotine
.
yet
i
would
have
told
you
how
i
was
duped
!
aye
!
i
,
whom
that
same
popular
rumour
had
endowed
with
the
sharpest
wits
in
france
!
i
was
tricked
into
doing
this
thing
,
by
men
who
knew
how
to
play
upon
my
love
for
an
only
brother
,
and
my
desire
for
revenge
.
was
it
unnatural
?
"
her
voice
became
choked
with
tears
.
she
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
,
trying
to
regain
some
sort
of
composure
.
she
looked
appealingly
at
him
,
almost
as
if
he
were
her
judge
.
he
had
allowed
her
to
speak
on
in
her
own
vehement
,
impassioned
way
,
offering
no
comment
,
no
word
of
sympathy
:
and
now
,
while
she
paused
,
trying
to
swallow
down
the
hot
tears
that
gushed
to
her
eyes
,
he
waited
,
impassive
and
still
.
the
dim
,
grey
light
of
early
dawn
seemed
to
make
his
tall
form
look
taller
and
more
rigid
.
the
lazy
,
good
-
natured
face
looked
strangely
altered
.
marguerite
,
excited
,
as
she
was
,
could
see
that
the
eyes
were
no
longer
languid
,
the
mouth
no
longer
good
-
humoured
and
inane
.
a
curious
look
of
intense
passion
seemed
to
glow
from
beneath
his
drooping
lids
,
the
mouth
was
tightly
closed
,
the
lips
compressed
,
as
if
the
will
alone
held
that
surging
passion
in
check
.
marguerite
blakeney
was
,
above
all
,
a
woman
,
with
all
a
woman
'
s
fascinating
foibles
,
all
a
woman
'
s
most
lovable
sins
.
she
knew
in
a
moment
that
for
the
past
few
months
she
had
been
mistaken
:
that
this
man
who
stood
here
before
her
,
cold
as
a
statue
,
when
her
musical
voice
struck
upon
his
ear
,
loved
her
,
as
he
had
loved
her
a
year
ago
:
that
his
passion
might
have
been
dormant
,
but
that
it
was
there
,
as
strong
,
as
intense
,
as
overwhelming
,
as
when
first
her
lips
met
his
in
one
long
,
maddening
kiss
.
pride
had
kept
him
from
her
,
and
,
woman
-
like
,
she
meant
to
win
back
that
conquest
which
had
been
hers
before
.
suddenly
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
only
happiness
life
could
every
hold
for
her
again
would
be
in
feeling
that
man
'
s
kiss
once
more
upon
her
lips
.
"
listen
to
the
tale
,
sir
percy
,
"
she
said
,
and
her
voice
was
low
,
sweet
,
infinitely
tender
.
"
armand
was
all
in
all
to
me
!
we
had
no
parents
,
and
brought
one
another
up
.
he
was
my
little
father
,
and
i
,
his
tiny
mother
;
we
loved
one
another
so
.
then
one
day
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
do
you
mind
me
,
sir
percy
?
the
marquis
de
st
.
cyr
had
my
brother
armand
thrashed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
thrashed
by
his
lacqueys
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
brother
whom
i
loved
better
than
all
the
world
!
and
his
offence
?
that
he
,
a
plebeian
,
had
dared
to
love
the
daughter
of
the
aristocrat
;
for
that
he
was
waylaid
and
thrashed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
thrashed
like
a
dog
within
an
inch
of
his
life
!
oh
,
how
i
suffered
!
his
humiliation
had
eaten
into
my
very
soul
!
when
the
opportunity
occurred
,
and
i
was
able
to
take
my
revenge
,
i
took
it
.
but
i
only
thought
to
bring
that
proud
marquis
to
trouble
and
humiliation
.
he
plotted
with
austria
against
his
own
country
.
chance
gave
me
knowledge
of
this
;
i
spoke
of
it
,
but
i
did
not
know
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
how
could
i
guess
?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
they
trapped
and
duped
me
.
when
i
realised
what
i
had
done
,
it
was
too
late
.
"
"
it
is
perhaps
a
little
difficult
,
madame
,
"
said
sir
percy
,
after
a
moment
of
silence
between
them
,
"
to
go
back
over
the
past
.
i
have
confessed
to
you
that
my
memory
is
short
,
but
the
thought
certainly
lingered
in
my
mind
that
,
at
the
time
of
the
marquis
'
death
,
i
entreated
you
for
an
explanation
of
those
same
noisome
popular
rumours
.
if
that
same
memory
does
not
,
even
now
,
play
me
a
trick
,
i
fancy
that
you
refused
me
all
explanation
then
,
and
demanded
of
my
love
a
humiliating
allegiance
it
was
not
prepared
to
give
.
"
"
i
wished
to
test
your
love
for
me
,
and
it
did
not
bear
the
test
.
you
used
to
tell
me
that
you
drew
the
very
breath
of
life
but
for
me
,
and
for
love
of
me
.
"
"
and
to
probe
that
love
,
you
demanded
that
i
should
forfeit
mine
honour
,
"
he
said
,
whilst
gradually
his
impassiveness
seemed
to
leave
him
,
his
rigidity
to
relax
;
"
that
i
should
accept
without
murmur
or
question
,
as
a
dumb
and
submissive
slave
,
every
action
of
my
mistress
.
my
heart
overflowing
with
love
and
passion
,
i
asked
for
no
explanation
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
waited
for
one
,
not
doubting
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
only
hoping
.
had
you
spoken
but
one
word
,
from
you
i
would
have
accepted
any
explanation
and
believed
it
.
but
you
left
me
without
a
word
,
beyond
a
bald
confession
of
the
actual
horrible
facts
;
proudly
you
returned
to
your
brother
'
s
house
,
and
left
me
alone
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
weeks
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
not
knowing
,
now
,
in
whom
to
believe
,
since
the
shrine
,
which
contained
my
one
illusion
,
lay
shattered
to
earth
at
my
feet
.
"
she
need
not
complain
now
that
he
was
cold
and
impassive
;
his
very
voice
shook
with
an
intensity
of
passion
,
which
he
was
making
superhuman
efforts
to
keep
in
check
.
"
aye
!
the
madness
of
my
pride
!
"
she
said
sadly
.
"
hardly
had
i
gone
,
already
i
had
repented
.
but
when
i
returned
,
i
found
you
,
oh
,
so
altered
!
wearing
already
that
mask
of
somnolent
indifference
which
you
have
never
laid
aside
until
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
until
now
.
"
she
was
so
close
to
him
that
her
soft
,
loose
hair
was
wafted
against
his
cheek
;
her
eyes
,
glowing
with
tears
,
maddened
him
,
the
music
in
her
voice
sent
fire
through
his
veins
.
but
he
would
not
yield
to
the
magic
charm
of
this
woman
whom
he
had
so
deeply
loved
,
and
at
whose
hands
his
pride
had
suffered
so
bitterly
.
he
closed
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
dainty
vision
of
that
sweet
face
,
of
that
snow
-
white
neck
and
graceful
figure
,
round
which
the
faint
rosy
light
of
dawn
was
just
beginning
to
hover
playfully
.
"
nay
,
madame
,
it
is
no
mask
,
"
he
said
icily
;
"
i
swore
to
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
once
,
that
my
life
was
yours
.
for
months
now
it
has
been
your
plaything
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
it
has
served
its
purpose
.
"
but
now
she
knew
that
the
very
coldness
was
a
mask
.
the
trouble
,
the
sorrow
she
had
gone
through
last
night
,
suddenly
came
back
into
her
mind
,
but
no
longer
with
bitterness
,
rather
with
a
feeling
that
this
man
who
loved
her
,
would
help
her
bear
the
burden
.
"
sir
percy
,
"
she
said
impulsively
,
"
heaven
knows
you
have
been
at
pains
to
make
the
task
,
which
i
had
set
to
myself
,
difficult
to
accomplish
.
you
spoke
of
my
mood
just
now
;
well
!
we
will
call
it
that
,
if
you
will
.
i
wished
to
speak
to
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
because

.
because
i

in
trouble

had
need

.
.
.
.
.
of
your
sympathy

"
"
it
is
yours
to
command
,
madame
.
"
"
how
cold
you
are
!
"
she
sighed
.
"
faith
!
i
can
scarce
believe
that
but
a
few
months
ago
one
tear
in
my
eye
had
set
you
well
-
nigh
crazy
.
now
i
come
to
you

a
half
-
broken
heart

.
.

"
i
pray
you
,
madame

he
said
,
whilst
his
voice
shook
almost
as
much
as
hers
,
"
in
what
way
can
i
serve
you
?
"
"
percy
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
armand
is
in
deadly
danger
.
a
letter
of
his
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
rash
,
impetuous
,
as
were
all
his
actions
,
and
written
to
sir
andrew
ffoulkes
,
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
fanatic
.
armand
is
hopelessly
compromised

.
.
.
.
.
.
to
-
morrow
,
perhaps
he
will
be
arrested

after

the
guillotine

.
.
.
oh
!
it
is
horrible
!
"
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
she
said
,
with
a
sudden
wail
of
anguish
,
as
all
the
events
of
the
past
night
came
rushing
back
to
her
mind
,
"
horrible
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
you
do
not
understand
.
.
.
.

you
cannot

no
one

can
turn

.
for
help
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
or
even
for
sympathy
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
tears
now
refused
to
be
held
back
.
all
her
trouble
,
her
struggles
,
the
awful
uncertainty
of
armand
'
s
fate
overwhelmed
her
.
she
tottered
,
ready
to
fall
,
and
leaning
against
the
tone
balustrade
,
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sobbed
bitterly
.
at
first
mention
of
armand
st
.
just
'
s
name
and
of
the
peril
in
which
he
stood
,
sir
percy
'
s
face
had
become
a
shade
more
pale
;
and
the
look
of
determination
and
obstinacy
appeared
more
marked
than
ever
between
his
eyes
.
however
,
he
said
nothing
for
the
moment
,
but
watched
her
,
as
her
delicate
frame
was
shaken
with
sobs
,
watched
her
until
unconsciously
his
face
softened
,
and
what
looked
almost
like
tears
seemed
to
glisten
in
his
eyes
.
"
and
so
,
"
he
said
with
bitter
sarcasm
,
"
the
murderous
dog
of
the
revolution
is
turning
upon
the
very
hands
that
fed
it
?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
begad
,
madame
,
"
he
added
very
gently
,
as
marguerite
continued
to
sob
hysterically
,
"
will
you
dry
your
tears
?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
never
could
bear
to
see
a
pretty
woman
cry
,
and
i
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
instinctively
,
with
sudden
overmastering
passion
at
the
sight
of
her
helplessness
and
of
her
grief
,
he
stretched
out
his
arms
,
and
the
next
,
would
have
seized
her
and
held
her
to
him
,
protected
from
every
evil
with
his
very
life
,
his
very
heart
'
s
blood
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
pride
had
the
better
of
it
in
this
struggle
once
again
;
he
restrained
himself
with
a
tremendous
effort
of
will
,
and
said
coldly
,
though
still
very
gently
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
will
you
not
turn
to
me
,
madame
,
and
tell
me
in
what
way
i
may
have
the
honour
to
serve
you
?
"
she
made
a
violent
effort
to
control
herself
,
and
turning
her
tear
-
stained
face
to
him
,
she
once
more
held
out
her
hand
,
which
he
kissed
with
the
same
punctilious
gallantry
;
but
marguerite
'
s
fingers
,
this
time
,
lingered
in
his
hand
for
a
second
or
two
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
,
and
this
was
because
she
had
felt
that
his
hand
trembled
perceptibly
and
was
burning
hot
,
whilst
his
lips
felt
as
cold
as
marble
.
"
can
you
do
aught
for
armand
?
"
she
said
sweetly
and
simply
.
"
you
have
so
much
influence
at
court
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
so
many
friends
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
nay
,
madame
,
should
you
not
seek
the
influence
of
your
french
friend
,
m
.
chauvelin
?
his
extends
,
if
i
mistake
not
,
even
as
far
as
the
republican
government
of
france
.
"
"
i
cannot
ask
him
,
percy
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
oh
!
i
wish
i
dared
to
tell
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
has
put
a
price
on
my
brother
'
s
head
,
which
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
she
would
have
given
worlds
if
she
had
felt
the
courage
then
to
tell
him
everything
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
all
she
had
done
that
night
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
how
she
had
suffered
and
how
her
hand
had
been
forced
.
but
she
dared
not
give
way
to
that
impulse
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
not
now
,
when
she
was
just
beginning
to
feel
that
he
still
loved
her
,
when
she
hoped
that
she
could
win
him
back
.
she
dared
not
make
another
confession
to
him
.
after
all
,
he
might
not
understand
;
he
might
not
sympathise
with
her
struggles
and
temptation
.
his
love
still
dormant
might
sleep
the
sleep
of
death
.
perhaps
he
divined
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
.
his
whole
attitude
was
one
of
intense
longing
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
veritable
prayer
for
that
confidence
,
which
her
foolish
pride
withheld
from
him
.
when
she
remained
silent
he
sighed
,
and
said
with
marked
coldness
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
faith
,
madame
,
since
it
distresses
you
,
we
will
not
speak
of
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
for
armand
,
i
pray
you
have
no
fear
.
i
pledge
you
my
word
that
he
shall
be
safe
.
now
,
have
i
your
permission
to
go
?
the
hour
is
getting
late
,
and
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
you
will
at
least
accept
my
gratitude
?
"
she
said
,
as
she
drew
quite
close
to
him
,
and
speaking
with
real
tenderness
.
with
a
quick
,
almost
involuntary
effort
he
would
have
taken
her
then
in
his
arms
,
for
her
eyes
were
swimming
in
tears
,
which
he
longed
to
kiss
away
;
but
she
had
lured
him
once
,
just
like
this
,
then
cast
him
aside
like
an
ill
-
fitting
glove
.
he
thought
this
was
but
a
mood
,
a
caprice
,
and
he
was
too
proud
to
lend
himself
to
it
once
again
.
"
it
is
too
soon
,
madame
!
"
he
said
quietly
;
"
i
have
done
nothing
as
yet
.
the
hour
is
late
,
and
you
must
be
fatigued
.
your
women
will
be
waiting
for
you
upstairs
.
"
he
stood
aside
to
allow
her
to
pass
.
she
sighed
,
a
quick
sigh
of
disappointment
.
his
pride
and
her
beauty
had
been
in
direct
conflict
,
and
his
pride
had
remained
the
conqueror
.
perhaps
,
after
all
,
she
had
been
deceived
just
now
;
what
she
took
to
be
the
light
of
love
in
his
eyes
might
only
have
been
the
passion
of
pride
or
,
who
knows
,
of
hatred
instead
of
love
.
she
stood
looking
at
him
for
a
moment
or
two
longer
.
he
was
again
as
rigid
,
as
impassive
,
as
before
.
pride
had
conquered
,
and
he
cared
naught
for
her
.
the
grey
light
of
dawn
was
gradually
yielding
to
the
rosy
light
of
the
rising
sun
.
birds
began
to
twitter
;
nature
awakened
,
smiling
in
happy
response
to
the
warmth
of
this
glorious
october
morning
.
only
between
these
two
hearts
there
lay
a
strong
,
impassable
barrier
,
built
up
of
pride
on
both
sides
,
which
neither
of
them
cared
to
be
the
first
to
demolish
.
he
had
bent
his
tall
figure
in
a
low
ceremonious
bow
,
as
she
finally
,
with
another
bitter
little
sigh
,
began
to
mount
the
terrace
steps
.
the
long
train
of
her
gold
-
embroidered
gown
swept
the
dead
leaves
off
the
steps
,
making
a
faint
harmonious
sh
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
sh
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
sh
as
she
glided
up
,
with
one
hand
resting
on
the
balustrade
,
the
rosy
light
of
dawn
making
an
aureole
of
gold
round
her
hair
,
and
causing
the
rubies
on
her
head
and
arms
to
sparkle
.
she
reached
the
tall
glass
doors
which
led
into
the
house
.
before
entering
,
she
paused
once
again
to
look
at
him
,
hoping
against
hope
to
see
his
arms
stretched
out
to
her
,
and
to
hear
his
voice
calling
her
back
.
but
he
had
not
moved
;
his
massive
figure
looked
the
very
personification
of
unbending
pride
,
of
fierce
obstinacy
.
hot
tears
again
surged
to
her
eyes
,
as
she
would
not
let
him
see
them
,
she
turned
quickly
within
,
and
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
up
to
her
own
rooms
.
had
she
but
turned
back
then
,
and
looked
out
once
more
on
to
the
rose
-
lit
garden
,
she
would
have
seen
that
which
would
have
made
her
own
sufferings
seem
but
light
and
easy
to
bear
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
strong
man
,
overwhelmed
with
his
own
passion
and
his
own
despair
.
pride
had
given
way
at
last
,
obstinacy
was
gone
:
the
will
was
powerless
.
he
was
but
a
man
madly
,
blindly
,
passionately
in
love
,
and
as
soon
as
her
light
footsteps
had
died
away
within
the
house
,
he
knelt
down
upon
the
terrace
steps
,
and
in
the
very
madness
of
his
love
he
kissed
one
by
one
the
places
where
her
small
foot
had
trodden
,
and
the
stone
balustrade
there
,
where
her
tiny
hand
had
rested
last
.
when
marguerite
reached
her
room
,
she
found
her
maid
terribly
anxious
about
her
.
"
your
ladyship
will
be
so
tired
,
"
said
the
poor
woman
,
whose
own
eyes
were
half
closed
with
sleep
.
"
it
is
past
five
o
'
clock
.
"
"
ah
,
yes
,
louise
,
i
daresay
i
shall
be
tired
presently
,
"
said
marguerite
,
kindly
;
"
but
you
are
very
tired
now
,
so
go
to
bed
at
once
.
i
will
get
into
bed
alone
.
"
"
but
,
my
lady
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
now
,
do
not
argue
,
louise
,
but
go
to
bed
.
give
me
a
wrap
,
and
leave
me
alone
.
"
louise
was
only
too
glad
to
obey
.
she
took
off
her
mistress
'
s
gorgeous
ball
-
dress
,
and
wrapped
her
up
in
a
soft
billowy
gown
.
"
does
your
ladyship
wish
for
anything
else
?
"
she
asked
,
when
that
was
done
.
"
no
,
nothing
more
.
put
out
the
lights
as
you
go
out
.
"
"
yes
,
my
lady
.
good
-
night
,
my
lady
.
"
"
good
-
night
,
louise
.
"
when
the
maid
was
gone
,
marguerite
drew
aside
the
curtains
and
threw
open
the
windows
.
the
garden
and
the
river
beyond
were
flooded
with
rosy
light
.
far
away
to
the
east
,
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
had
changed
the
rose
into
vivid
gold
.
the
lawn
was
deserted
now
,
and
marguerite
looked
down
upon
the
terrace
where
she
had
stood
a
few
moments
ago
trying
in
vain
to
win
back
a
man
'
s
love
,
which
once
had
been
so
wholly
hers
.
it
was
strange
that
through
all
her
troubles
,
all
her
anxiety
for
armand
,
she
was
mostly
conscious
at
the
present
moment
of
a
keen
and
bitter
heartache
.
her
very
limbs
seemed
to
ache
with
longing
for
the
love
of
a
man
who
had
spurned
her
,
who
had
resisted
her
tenderness
,
remained
cold
to
her
appeals
,
and
had
not
responded
to
the
glow
of
passion
,
which
had
caused
her
to
feel
and
hope
that
those
happy
olden
days
in
paris
were
not
all
dead
and
forgotten
.
how
strange
it
all
was
!
she
loved
him
still
.
and
now
that
she
looked
back
upon
the
last
few
months
of
misunderstandings
and
of
loneliness
,
she
realised
that
she
had
never
ceased
to
love
him
;
that
deep
down
in
her
heart
she
had
always
vaguely
felt
that
his
foolish
inanities
,
his
empty
laugh
,
his
lazy
nonchalance
were
nothing
but
a
mask
;
that
the
real
man
,
strong
,
passionate
,
wilful
,
was
there
still
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
man
she
had
loved
,
whose
intensity
had
fascinated
her
,
whose
personality
attracted
her
,
since
she
always
felt
that
behind
his
apparently
slow
wits
there
was
a
certain
something
,
which
he
kept
hidden
from
all
the
world
,
and
most
especially
from
her
.
a
woman
'
s
heart
is
such
a
complex
problem
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
owner
thereof
is
often
most
incompetent
to
find
the
solution
of
this
puzzle
.
did
marguerite
blakeney
,
"
the
cleverest
woman
in
europe
,
"
really
love
a
fool
?
was
it
love
that
she
had
felt
for
him
a
year
ago
when
she
married
him
?
was
it
love
she
felt
for
him
now
that
she
realised
that
he
still
loved
her
,
but
that
he
would
not
become
her
slave
,
her
passionate
,
ardent
lover
once
again
?
nay
!
marguerite
herself
could
not
have
told
that
.
not
at
this
moment
at
any
rate
;
perhaps
her
pride
had
sealed
her
mind
against
a
better
understanding
of
her
own
heart
.
but
this
she
did
know
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
she
meant
to
capture
that
obstinate
heart
back
again
.
that
she
would
conquer
once
more
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
then
,
that
she
would
never
lose
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
she
would
keep
him
,
keep
his
love
,
deserve
it
,
and
cherish
it
;
for
this
much
was
certain
,
that
there
was
no
longer
any
happiness
possible
for
her
without
that
one
man
'
s
love
.
thus
the
most
contradictory
thoughts
and
emotions
rushed
madly
through
her
mind
.
absorbed
in
them
,
she
had
allowed
time
to
slip
by
;
perhaps
,
tired
out
with
long
excitement
,
she
had
actually
closed
her
eyes
and
sunk
into
a
troubled
sleep
,
wherein
quickly
fleeting
dreams
seemed
but
the
continuation
of
her
anxious
thoughts
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
when
suddenly
she
was
roused
,
from
dream
or
meditation
,
by
the
noise
of
footsteps
outside
her
door
.
nervously
she
jumped
up
and
listened
;
the
house
itself
was
as
still
as
ever
;
the
footsteps
had
retreated
.
through
her
wide
-
open
window
the
brilliant
rays
of
the
morning
sun
were
flooding
her
room
with
light
.
she
looked
up
at
the
clock
;
it
was
half
-
past
six
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
too
early
for
any
of
the
household
to
be
already
astir
.
she
certainly
must
have
dropped
asleep
,
quite
unconsciously
.
the
noise
of
the
footsteps
,
also
of
hushed
subdued
voices
had
awakened
her
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
what
could
they
be
?
gently
,
on
tip
-
toe
,
she
crossed
the
room
and
opened
the
door
to
listen
;
not
a
sound
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
peculiar
stillness
of
the
early
morning
when
sleep
with
all
mankind
is
at
its
heaviest
.
but
the
noise
had
made
her
nervous
,
and
when
,
suddenly
,
at
her
feet
,
on
the
very
doorstep
,
she
saw
something
white
lying
there
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
letter
evidently
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
she
hardly
dared
touch
it
.
it
seemed
so
ghostlike
.
it
certainly
was
not
there
when
she
came
upstairs
;
had
louise
dropped
it
?
or
was
some
tantalising
spook
at
play
,
showing
her
fairy
letters
where
none
existed
?
at
last
she
stooped
to
pick
it
up
,
and
,
amazed
,
puzzled
beyond
measure
,
she
saw
that
the
letter
was
addressed
to
herself
in
her
husband
'
s
large
,
businesslike
-
looking
hand
.
what
could
he
have
to
say
to
her
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
which
could
not
be
put
off
until
the
morning
?
she
tore
open
the
envelope
and
read
:
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
a
most
unforeseen
circumstance
forces
me
to
leave
for
the
north
immediately
,
so
i
beg
your
ladyship
'
s
pardon
if
i
do
not
avail
myself
of
