paris
a

of

of

in
its

most

france

a

oh
mighty
holy

apotheosis
of

and

grand
rival
of
decadent
christianity
five
weeks
now
since
marat
the
bloodthirsty
friend
of
the
people
succumbed
beneath
the
sheath
-
knife
of
a
virgin
patriot
a
month
since
his
murderess
walked
proudly
even
enthusiastically
to
the
guillotine
there
has
been
no
reaction
only
a
great
sigh
not
of
content
or
satisfied
lust
but
a
sigh
such
as
the
man
-
eating
tiger
might
heave
after
his
first
taste
of
long
-
coveted
blood
a
sigh
for
more
a
king
on
the
scaffold
a
queen
degraded
and
abased
awaiting
death
which
lingers
on
the
threshold
of
her
infamous
prison
eight
hundred
scions
of
ancient

that
have
made

of

brave

all
by

and
by

up
the
few
wooden
steps
which
lead
to
the
guillotine
an
achievement
of
truth
and
still
that
sigh
for
more
but
for
the
moment
a
few
seconds
only
paris
looked
round
her
mighty
self
and
thought
things
over
the
man
-
eating
tiger
for
the
space
of
a
sigh
licked
his
powerful
jaws
and
pondered
something
new
something
wonderful
we
have
had
a
new
constitution
a
new
justice
new
laws
a
new
almanack
what
next
why
obviously
how
comes
it
that
great
intellectual
aesthetic
paris
never
thought
of
such
a
wonderful
thing
before
a
new
religion
christianity
is
old
and
obsolete
priests
are
aristocrats
wealthy
oppressors
of
the
people
the
church
but
another
form
of
wanton
tyranny
let
us
by
all
means
have
a
new
religion
already
something
has
been
done
to
destroy
the
old
to
destroy
always
to
destroy
churches
have
been
ransacked
altars
spoliated
tombs
desecrated
priests
and
curates
murdered
but
that
is
not
enough
there
must
be
a
new
religion
and
to
attain
that
there
must
be
a
new
god
man
is
a
born
idol
-
worshipper
very
well
then
let
the
people
have
a
new
religion
and
a
new
god
stay
not
a
god
this
time
for
god
means
majesty
power
kingship
everything
in
fact
which
the
mighty
hand
of
the
people
of
france
has
struggled
and
fought
to
destroy
not
a
god
but
a
goddess
a
goddess
an
idol
a
toy
since
even
the
man
-
eating
tiger
must
play
sometimes
paris
wanted
a
new
religion
and
a
new
toy
and
grave
men
ardent
patriots
mad
enthusiasts
sat
in
the
assembly
of
the
convention
and
seriously
discussed
the
means
of
providing
her
with
both
these
things
which
she
asked
for
chaumette
i
think
it
was
who
first
solved
the
difficulty
procureur
chaumette
head
of
the
paris
municipality
he
who
had
ordered
that
the
cart
which
bore
the
dethroned
queen
to
the
squalid
prison
of
the
conciergerie
should
be
led
slowly
past
her
own
late
palace
of
the
tuileries
and
should
be
stopped
there
just
long
enough
for
her
to
see
and
to
feel
in
one
grand
mental
vision
all
that
she
had
been
when
she
dwelt
there
and
all
that
she
now
was
by
the
will
of
the
people
chaumette
as
you
see
was
refined
artistic
the
torture
of
the
fallen
queen
'
s
heart
meant
more
to
him
than
a
blow
of
the
guillotine
on
her
neck
no
wonder
therefore
that
it
was
procureur
chaumette
who
first
discovered
exactly
what
type
of
new
religion
paris
wanted
just
now
let
us
have
a
goddess
of
reason
he
said
typified
if
you
will
by
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
paris
let
us
have
a
feast
of
the
goddess
of
reason
let
there
be
a
pyre
of
all
the
gew
-
gaws
which
for
centuries
have
been
flaunted
by
overbearing
priests
before
the
eyes
of
starving
multitudes
let
the
people
rejoice
and
dance
around
that
funeral
pile
and
above
it
all
let
the
new
goddess
tower
smiling
and
triumphant
the
goddess
of
reason
the
only
deity
our
new
and
regenerate
france
shall
acknowledge
throughout
the
centuries
which
are
to
come
loud
applause
greeted
the
impassioned
speech
a
new
goddess
by
all
means
shouted
the
grave
gentlemen
of
the
national
assembly
the
goddess
of
reason
they
were
all
eager
that
the
people
should
have
this
toy
something
to
play
with
and
to
tease
round
which
to
dance
the
mad
carmagnole
and
sing
the
ever
-
recurring
ca
ira
something
to
distract
the
minds
of
the
populace
from
the
consequences
of
its
own
deeds
and
the
helplessness
of
its
legislators
procureur
chaumette
enlarged
upon
his
original
idea
like
a
true
artist
who
sees
the
broad
effect
of
a
picture
at
a
glance
and
then
fills
in
the
minute
details
he
was
already
busy
elaborating
his
scheme
the
goddess
must
be
beautiful
not
too
young
reason
can
only
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
riper
age
of
second
youth
she
must
be
decked
out
in
classical
draperies
severe
yet
suggestive
she
must
be
rouged
and
painted
for
she
is
a
mere
idol
easily
to
be
appeased
with
incense
music
and
laughter
he
was
getting
deeply
interested
in
his
subject
seeking
minutiae
of
detail
with
which
to
render
his
theme
more
and
more
attractive
but
patience
was
never
the
characteristic
of
the
revolutionary
government
of
france
the
national
assembly
soon
tired
of
chaumette
'
s
dithyrambic
utterances
up
aloft
on
the
mountain
danton
was
yawning
like
a
gigantic
leopard
soon
henriot
was
on
his
feet
he
had
a
far
finer
scheme
than
that
of
the
procureur
to
place
before
his
colleagues
a
grand
national
fete
semi
-
religious
in
character
but
of
the
new
religion
which
destroyed
and
desecrated
and
never
knelt
in
worship
citizen
chaumette
'
s
goddess
of
reason
by
all
means
henriot
conceded
that
the
idea
was
a
good
one
but
the
goddess
merely
as
a
figure
-
head
around
her
a
procession
of
unfrocked
and
apostate
priests
typifying
the
destruction
of
ancient
hierarchy
mules
carrying
loads
of
sacred
vessels
the
spoils
of
ten
thousand
churches
of
france
and
ballet
girls
in
bacchanalian
robes
dancing
the
carmagnole
around
the
new
deity
public
prosecutor
foucquier
tinville
thought
all
these
schemes
very
tame
why
should
the
people
of
france
be
led
to
think
that
the
era
of
a
new
religion
would
mean
an
era
of
milk
and
water
of
pageants
and
of
fireworks
let
every
man
woman
and
child
know
that
this
was
an
era
of
blood
and
again
of
blood
oh
he
exclaimed
in
passionate
accents
would
that
all
the
traitors
in
france
had
but
one
head
that
it
might
be
cut
off
with
one
blow
of
the
guillotine
he
approved
of
the
national
fete
but
he
desired
an
apotheosis
of
the
guillotine
he
undertook
to
find
ten
thousand
traitors
to
be
beheaded
on
one
grand
and
glorious
day
ten
thousand
heads
to
adorn
the
place
de
la
revolution
on
a
great
never
-
to
-
be
-
forgotten
evening
after
the
guillotine
had
accomplished
this
record
work
but
collot
d
'
herbois
would
also
have
his
say
collot
lately
hailed
from
the
south
with
a
reputation
for
ferocity
unparalleled
throughout
the
whole
of
this
horrible
decade
he
would
not
be
outdone
by
tinville
'
s
bloodthirsty
schemes
he
was
the
inventor
of
the
noyades
which
had
been
so
successful
at
lyons
and
marseilles
why
not
give
the
inhabitants
of
paris
one
of
these
exhilarating
spectacles
he
asked
with
a
coarse
brutal
laugh
then
he
explained
his
invention
of
which
he
was
inordinately
proud
some
two
or
three
hundred
traitors
men
women
and
children
tied
securely
together
with
ropes
in
great
human
bundles
and
thrown
upon
a
barge
in
the
middle
of
the
river
the
barge
with
a
hole
in
her
bottom
not
too
large
only
sufficient
to
cause
her
to
sink
slowly
very
slowly
in
sight
of
the
crowd
of
delighted
spectators
the
cries
of
the
women
and
children
and
even
of
the
men
as
they
felt
the
waters
rising
and
gradually
enveloping
them
as
they
felt
themselves
powerless
even
for
a
fruitless
struggle
had
proved
most
exhilarating
so
citizen
collot
declared
to
the
hearts
of
the
true
patriots
of
lyons
thus
the
discussion
continued
this
was
the
era
when
every
man
had
but
one
desire
that
of
outdoing
others
in
ferocity
and
brutality
and
but
one
care
that
of
saving
his
own
head
by
threatening
that
of
his
neighbour
the
great
duel
between
the
titanic
leaders
of
these
turbulent
parties
the
conflict
between
hot
-
headed
danton
on
the
one
side
and
cold
-
blooded
robespierre
on
the
other
had
only
just
begun
the
great
all
-
devouring
monsters
had
dug
their
claws
into
one
another
but
the
issue
of
the
combat
was
still
at
stake
neither
of
these
two
giants
had
taken
part
in
these
deliberations
anent
the
new
religion
and
the
new
goddess
danton
gave
signs
now
and
then
of
the
greatest
impatience
and
muttered
something
about
a
new
form
of
tyranny
a
new
kind
of
oppression
on
the
left
robespierre
in
immaculate
sea
-
green
coat
and
carefully
gauffered
linen
was
quietly
polishing
the
nails
of
his
right
hand
against
the
palm
of
his
left
but
nothing
escaped
him
of
what
was
going
on
his
ferocious
egoism
his
unbounded
ambition
was
even
now
calculating
what
advantages
to
himself
might
accrue
from
this
idea
of
the
new
religion
and
of
the
national
fete
what
personal
aggrandisement
he
could
derive
therefrom
the
matter
outwardly
seemed
trivial
enough
but
already
his
keen
and
calculating
mind
had
seen
various
side
issues
which
might
tend
to
place
him
robespierre
on
a
yet
higher
and
more
unassailable
pinnacle
surrounded
by
those
who
hated
him
those
who
envied
and
those
who
feared
him
he
ruled
over
them
all
by
the
strength
of
his
own
cold
-
blooded
savagery
by
the
resistless
power
of
his
merciless
cruelty
he
cared
about
nobody
but
himself
about
nothing
but
his
own
exaltation
every
action
of
his
career
since
he
gave
up
his
small
practice
in
a
quiet
provincial
town
in
order
to
throw
himself
into
the
wild
vortex
of
revolutionary
politics
every
word
he
ever
uttered
had
but
one
aim
himself
he
saw
his
colleagues
and
comrades
of
the
old
jacobin
clubs
ruthlessly
destroyed
around
him
friends
he
had
none
and
all
left
him
indifferent
and
now
he
had
hundreds
of
enemies
in
every
assembly
and
club
in
paris
and
these
too
one
by
one
were
being
swept
up
in
that
wild
whirlpool
which
they
themselves
had
created
impassive
serene
always
ready
with
a
calm
answer
when
passion
raged
most
hotly
around
him
robespierre
the
most
ambitious
most
self
-
seeking
demagogue
of
his
time
had
acquired
the
reputation
of
being
incorruptible
and
self
-
less
an
enthusiastic
servant
of
the
republic
the
sea
-
green
incorruptible
and
thus
whilst
others
talked
and
argued
waxed
hot
over
schemes
for
processions
and
pageantry
or
loudly
denounced
the
whole
matter
as
the
work
of
a
traitor
he
of
the
sea
-
green
coat
sat
quietly
polishing
his
nails
but
he
had
already
weighed
all
these
discussions
in
the
balance
of
his
mind
placed
them
in
the
crucible
of
his
ambition
and
turned
them
into
something
that
would
benefit
him
and
strengthen
his
position
aye
the
feast
should
be
brilliant
enough
gay
or
horrible
mad
or
fearful
but
through
it
all
the
people
of
france
must
be
made
to
feel
that
there
was
a
guiding
hand
which
ruled
the
destinies
of
all
a
head
which
framed
the
new
laws
which
consolidated
the
new
religion
and
established
its
new
goddess
the
goddess
of
reason
robespierre
her
prophet
the
room
was
close
and
dark
filled
with
the
smoke
from
a
defective
chimney
a
tiny
boudoir
once
the
dainty
sanctum
of
imperious
marie
antoinette
a
faint
and
ghostly
odour
like
unto
the
perfume
of
spectres
seemed
still
to
cling
to
the
stained
walls
and
to
the
torn
gobelin
tapestries
everywhere
lay
the
impress
of
a
heavy
and
destroying
hand
that
of
the
great
and
glorious
revolution
in
the
mud
-
soiled
corners
of
the
room
a
few
chairs
with
brocaded
cushions
rudely
torn
leant
broken
and
desolate
against
the
walls
a
small
footstool
once
gilt
-
legged
and
satin
-
covered
had
been
overturned
and
roughly
kicked
to
one
side
and
there
it
lay
on
its
back
like
some
little
animal
that
had
been
hurt
stretching
its
broken
limbs
upwards
pathetic
to
behold
from
the
delicately
wrought
buhl
table
the
silver
inlay
had
been
harshly
stripped
out
of
its
bed
of
shell
across
the
lunette
painted
by
boucher
and
representing
a
chaste
diana
surrounded
by
a
bevy
of
nymphs
an
uncouth
hand
had
scribbled
in
charcoal
the
device
of
the
revolution
liberte
egalite
fraternite
ou
la
mort
whilst
as
if
to
give
a
crowning
point
to
the
work
of
destruction
and
to
emphasise
its
motto
someone
had
decorated
the
portrait
of
marie
antoinette
with
a
scarlet
cap
and
drawn
a
red
and
ominous
line
across
her
neck
and
at
the
table
two
men
were
sitting
in
close
and
eager
conclave
between
them
a
solitary
tallow
candle
unsnuffed
and
weirdly
flickering
threw
fantastic
shadows
upon
the
walls
and
illumined
with
fitful
and
uncertain
light
the
faces
of
the
two
men
how
different
were
these
in
character
one
high
cheek
-
boned
with
coarse
sensuous
lips
and
hair
elaborately
and
carefully
powdered
the
other
pale
and
thin
-
lipped
with
the
keen
eyes
of
a
ferret
and
a
high
intellectual
forehead
from
which
the
sleek
brown
hair
was
smoothly
brushed
away
the
first
of
these
men
was
robespierre
the
ruthless
and
incorruptible
demagogue
the
other
was
citizen
chauvelin
ex
-
ambassador
of
the
revolutionary
government
at
the
english
court
the
hour
was
late
and
the
noises
from
the
great
seething
city
preparing
for
sleep
came
to
this
remote
little
apartment
in
the
now
deserted
palace
of
the
tuileries
merely
as
a
faint
and
distant
echo
it
was
two
days
after
the
fructidor
riots
paul
deroulede
and
the
woman
juliette
marny
both
condemned
to
death
had
been
literally
spirited
away
out
of
the
cart
which
was
conveying
them
from
the
hall
of
justice
to
the
luxembourg
prison
and
news
had
just
been
received
by
the
committee
of
public
safety
that
at
lyons
the
abbe
du
mesnil
with
the
ci
-
devant
chevalier
d
'
egremont
and
the
latter
'
s
wife
and
family
had
effected
a
miraculous
and
wholly
incomprehensible
escape
from
the
northern
prison
but
this
was
not
all
when
arras
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
revolutionary
army
and
a
regular
cordon
was
formed
round
the
town
so
that
not
a
single
royalist
traitor
might
escape
some
three
score
women
and
children
twelve
priests
the
old
aristocrats
chermeuil
delleville
and
galipaux
and
many
others
managed
to
pass
the
barriers
and
were
never
recaptured
raids
were
made
on
the
suspected
houses
in
paris
chiefly
where
the
escaped
prisoners
might
have
found
refuge
or
better
still
where
their
helpers
and
rescuers
might
still
be
lurking
foucquier

public

led
and

these
raids
assisted
by
that
bloodthirsty

they
heard
of

rue
de
l
'
ancienne
comedie
where
an
englishmen
was
said
to
have
lodged
for
two
days
they
demanded
admittance
and
were
taken
to
the
rooms
where
the
englishman
had
stayed
these
were
bare
and
squalid
like
hundreds
of
other
rooms
in
the
poorer
quarters
of
paris
the
landlady
toothless
and
grimy
had
not
yet
tidied
up
the
one
where
the
englishman
had
slept
in
fact
she
did
not
know
he
had
left
for
good
he
had
paid
for
his
room
a
week
in
advance
and
came
and
went
as
he
liked
she
explained
to
citizen
tinville
she
never
bothered
about
him
as
he
never
took
a
meal
in
the
house
and
he
was
only
there
two
days
she
did
not
know
her
lodger
was
english
until
the
day
he
left
she
thought
he
was
a
frenchman
from
the
south
as
he
certainly
had
a
peculiar
accent
when
he
spoke
it
was
the
day
of
the
riots
she
continued
he
would
go
out
and
i
told
him
i
did
not
think
that
the
streets
would
be
safe
for
a
foreigner
like
him
for
he
always
wore
such
very
fine
clothes
and
i
made
sure
that
the
starving
men
and
women
of
paris
would
strip
them
off
his
back
when
their
tempers
were
roused
but
he
only
laughed
he
gave
me
a
bit
of
paper
and
told
me
that
if
he
did
not
return
i
might
conclude
that
he
had
been
killed
and
if
the
committee
of
public
safety
asked
me
questions
about
me
i
was
just
to
show
the
bit
of
paper
and
there
would
be
no
further
trouble
she
had
talked
volubly
more
than
a
little
terrified
at
merlin
'
s
scowls
and
the
attitude
of
citizen
tinville
who
was
known
to
be
very
severe
if
anyone
committed
any
blunders
but
the
citizeness
her
name
was
brogard
and
her
husband
'
s
brother
kept
an
inn
in
the
neighbourhood
of
calais
the
citizeness
brogard
had
a
clear
conscience
she
held
a
license
from
the
committee
of
public
safety
for
letting
apartments
and
she
had
always
given
due
notice
to
the
committee
of
the
arrival
and
departure
of
her
lodgers
the
only
thing
was
that
if
any
lodger
paid
her
more
than
ordinarily
well
for
the
accommodation
and
he
so
desired
it
she
would
send
in
the
notice
conveniently
late
and
conveniently
vaguely
worded
as
to
the
description
status
and
nationality
of
her
more
liberal
patrons
this
had
occurred
in
the
case
of
her
recent
english
visitor
but
she
did
not
explain
it
quite
like
that
to
citizen
foucquier
tinville
or
to
citizen
merlin
however
she
was
rather
frightened
and
produced
the
scrap
of
paper
which
the
englishman
had
left
with
her
together
with
the
assurance
that
when
she
showed
it
there
would
be
no
further
trouble
tinville
took
it
roughly
out
of
her
hand
but
would
not
glance
at
it
he
crushed
it
into
a
ball
and
then
merlin
snatched
it
from
him
with
a
coarse
laugh
smoothed
out
the
creases
on
his
knee
and
studied
it
for
a
moment
there
were
two
lines
of
what
looked
like
poetry
written
in
a
language
which
merlin
did
not
understand
english
no
doubt
but
what
was
perfectly
clear
and
easily
comprehended
by
any
one
was
the
little
drawing
in
the
corner
done
in
red
ink
and
representing
a
small
star
-
shaped
flower
then
tinville
and
merlin
both
cursed
loudly
and
volubly
and
bidding
their
men
follow
them
turned
away
from
the
house
in
the
rue
de
l
'
ancienne
comedie
and
left
its
toothless
landlady
on
her
own
doorstep
still
volubly
protesting
her
patriotism
and
her
desire
to
serve
the
government
of
the
republic
tinville
and
merlin
however
took
the
scrap
of
paper
to
citizen
robespierre
who
smiled
grimly
as
he
in
his
turn
crushed
the
offensive
little
document
in
the
palm
of
his
well
-
washed
hands
robespierre
did
not
swear
he
never
wasted
either
words
or
oaths
but
he
slipped
the
bit
of
paper
inside
the
double
lid
of
his
silver
snuff
box
and
then
he
sent
a
special
messenger
to
citizen
chauvelin
in
the
rue
corneille
bidding
him
come
that
same
evening
after
ten
o
'
clock
to
room
no
16
in
the
ci
-
devant
palace
of
the
tuileries
it
was
now
half
-
past
ten
and
chauvelin
and
robespierre
sat
opposite
one
another
in
the
ex
-
boudoir
of
queen
marie
antoinette
and
between
them
on
the
table
just
below
the
tallow
-
candle
was
a
much
creased
exceedingly
grimy
bit
of
paper
it
had
passed
through
several
unclean
hands
before
citizen
robespierre
'
s
immaculately
white
fingers
had
smoothed
it
out
and
placed
it
before
the
eyes
of
ex
-
ambassador
chauvelin
the
latter
however
was
not
looking
at
the
paper
he
was
not
even
looking
at
the
pale
cruel
face
before
him
he
had
closed
his
eyes
and
for
a
moment
had
lost
sight
of
the
small
dark
room
of
robespierre
'
s
ruthless
gaze
of
the
mud
-
stained
walls
and
greasy
floor
he
was
seeing
as
in
a
bright
and
sudden
vision
the
brilliantly
-
lighted
salons
of
the
foreign
office
in
london
with
beautiful
marguerite
blakeney
gliding
queenlike
on
the
arm
of
the
prince
of
wales
he
heard
the
flutter
of
many
fans
the
frou
-
frou
of
silk
dresses
and
above
all
the
din
and
sound
of
dance
music
he
heard
an
inane
laugh
and
an
affected
voice
repeating
the
doggerel
rhyme
that
was
even
now
written
on
that
dirty
piece
of
paper
which
robespierre
had
placed
before
him
we
seek
him
here
and
we
seek
him
there
those
frenchies
seek
him
everywhere
is
he
in
heaven
is
he
in
hell
that
demmed
elusive
pimpernel
it
was
a
mere
flash
one
of
memory
'
s
swiftly
effaced
pictures
when
she
shows
us
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
indelible
pictures
from
out
our
past
chauvelin
in
that
same
second
while
his
own
eyes
were
closed
and
robespierre
'
s
fixed
upon
him
also
saw
the
lonely
cliffs
of
calais
heard
the
same
voice
singing
god
save
the
king
the
volley
of
musketry
the
despairing
cries
of
marguerite
blakeney
and
once
again
he
felt
the
keen
and
bitter
pang
of
complete
humiliation
and
defeat
robespierre
had
quietly
waited
the
while
he
was
in
no
hurry
being
a
night
-
bird
of
very
pronounced
tastes
he
was
quite
ready
to
sit
here
until
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
watching
citizen
chauvelin
mentally
writhing
in
the
throes
of
recollections
of
the
past
few
months
there
was
nothing
that
delighted
the
sea
-
green
incorruptible
quite
so
much
as
the
aspect
of
a
man
struggling
with
a
hopeless
situation
and
feeling
a
net
of
intrigue
drawing
gradually
tighter
and
tighter
around
him
even
now
when
he
saw
chauvelin
'
s
smooth
forehead
wrinkled
into
an
anxious
frown
and
his
thin
hand
nervously
clutched
upon
the
table
robespierre
heaved
a
pleasurable
sigh
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
said
with
an
amiable
smile
you
do
agree
with
me
then
citizen
that
the
situation
has
become
intolerable
then
as
chauvelin
did
not
reply
he
continued
speaking
more
sharply
and
how
terribly
galling
it
all
is
when
we
could
have
had
that
man
under
the
guillotine
by
now
if
you
had
not
blundered
so
terribly
last
year
his
voice
had
become
hard
and
trenchant
like
that
knife
to
which
he
was
so
ready
to
make
constant
allusion
but
chauvelin
still
remained
silent
there
was
really
nothing
that
he
could
say
citizen
chauvelin
how
you
must
hate
that
man
exclaimed
robespierre
at
last
then
only
did
chauvelin
break
the
silence
which
up
to
now
he
had
appeared
to
have
forced
himself
to
keep
i
do
he
said
with
unmistakable
fervour
then
why
do
you
not
make
an
effort
to
retrieve
the
blunders
of
last
year
queried
robespierre
blandly
the
republic
has
been
unusually
patient
and
long
-
suffering
with
you
citizen
chauvelin
she
has
taken
your
many
services
and
well
-
known
patriotism
into
consideration
but
you
know
he
added
significantly
that
she
has
no
use
for
worthless
tools
then
as
chauvelin
seemed
to
have
relapsed
into
sullen
silence
he
continued
with
his
original
ill
-
omened
blandness
ma
foi
citizen
chauvelin
were
i
standing
in
your
buckled
shoes
i
would
not
lose
another
hour
in
trying
to
avenge
mine
own
humiliation
have
i
ever
had
a
chance
burst
out
chauvelin
with
ill
-
suppressed
vehemence
what
can
i
do
single
-
handed
since
war
has
been
declared
i
cannot
go
to
england
unless
the
government
will
find
some
official
reason
for
my
doing
so
there
is
much
grumbling
and
wrath
over
here
and
when
that
damned
scarlet
pimpernel
league
has
been
at
work
when
a
score
or
so
of
valuable
prizes
have
been
snatched
from
under
the
very
knife
of
the
guillotine
then
there
is
much
gnashing
of
teeth
and
useless
cursings
but
nothing
serious
or
definite
is
done
to
smother
those
accursed
english
flies
which
come
buzzing
about
our
ears
nay
you
forget
citizen
chauvelin
retorted
robespierre
that
we
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
are
far
more
helpless
than
you
you
know
the
language
of
these
people
we
do
not
you
know
their
manners
and
customs
their
ways
of
thought
the
methods
they
are
likely
to
employ
we
know
none
of
these
things
you
have
seen
and
spoken
to
men
in
england
who
are
members
of
that
damned
league
you
have
seen
the
man
who
is
its
leader
we
have
not
he
leant
forward
on
the
table
and
looked
more
searchingly
at
the
thin
pallid
face
before
him
if
you
named
that
leader
to
me
now
if
you
described
him
we
could
go
to
work
more
easily
you
could
name
him
and
you
would
citizen
chauvelin
i
cannot
retorted
chauvelin
doggedly
ah
but
i
think
you
could
but
there
i
do
not
blame
your
silence
you
would
wish
to
reap
the
reward
of
your
own
victory
to
be
the
instrument
of
your
own
revenge
passions
i
think
it
natural
but
in
the
name
of
your
own
safety
citizen
do
not
be
too
greedy
with
your
secret
if
the
man
is
known
to
you
find
him
again
find
him
lure
him
to
france
we
want
him
the
people
want
him
and
if
the
people
do
not
get
what
they
want
they
will
turn
on
those
who
have
withheld
their
prey
i
understand
citizen
that
your
own
safety
and
that
of
your
government
is
involved
in
this
renewed
attempt
to
capture
the
scarlet
pimpernel
retorted
chauvelin
drily
and
your
head
citizen
chauvelin
concluded
robespierre
nay
i
know
that
well
enough
and
you
may
believe
me
and
you
will
citizen
when
i
say
that
i
care
but
little
about
that
the
question
is
if
i
am
to
lure
that
man
to
france
what
will
you
and
your
government
do
to
help
me
everything
replied
robespierre
provided
you
have
a
definite
plan
and
a
definite
purpose
i
have
both
but
i
must
go
to
england
in
at
least
a
semi
-
official
capacity
i
can
do
nothing
if
i
am
to
hide
in
disguise
in
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
corners
that
is
easily
done
there
has
been
some
talk
with
the
british
authorities
anent
the
security
and
welfare
of
peaceful
french
subjects
settled
in
england
after
a
good
deal
of
correspondence
they
have
suggested
our
sending
a
semi
-
official
representative
over
there
to
look
after
the
interests
of
our
own
people
commercially
and
financially
we
can
easily
send
you
over
in
that
capacity
if
it
would
suit
your
purpose
admirably
i
have
only
need
of
a
cloak
that
one
will
do
as
well
as
another
is
that
all
not
quite
i
have
several
plans
in
my
head
and
i
must
know
that
i
am
fully
trusted
above
all
i
must
have
power
decisive
absolute
illimitable
power
there
was
nothing
of
the
weakling
about
this
small
sable
-
clad
man
who
looked
the
redoubtable
jacobin
leader
straight
in
the
face
and
brought
a
firm
fist
resolutely
down
upon
the
table
before
him
robespierre
paused
a
while
ere
he
replied
he
was
eying
the
other
man
keenly
trying
to
read
if
behind
that
earnest
frowning
brow
there
did
not
lurk
some
selfish
ulterior
motive
along
with
that
demand
for
absolute
power
but
chauvelin
did
not
flinch
beneath
that
gaze
which
could
make
every
cheek
in
france
blanch
with
unnamed
terror
and
after
that
slight
moment
of
hesitation
robespierre
said
quietly
you
shall
have
the
complete
power
of
a
military
dictator
in
every
town
or
borough
of
france
which
you
may
visit
the
revolutionary
government
shall
create
you
before
you
start
for
england
supreme
head
of
all
the
sub
-
committees
of
public
safety
this
will
mean
that
in
the
name
of
the
safety
of
the
republic
every
order
given
by
you
of
whatsoever
nature
it
might
be
must
be
obeyed
implicitly
under
pain
of
an
arraignment
for
treason
chauvelin
sighed
a
quick
sharp
sigh
of
intense
satisfaction
which
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
disguise
before
robespierre
i
shall
want
agents
he
said
or
shall
we
say
spies
and
of
course
money
you
shall
have
both
we
keep
a
very
efficient
secret
service
in
england
and
they
do
a
great
deal
of
good
over
there
there
is
much
dissatisfaction
in
their
midland
counties
you
remember
the
birmingham
riots
they
were
chiefly
the
work
of
our
own
spies
then
you
know
candeille
the
actress
she
had
found
her
way
among
some
of
those
circles
in
london
who
have
what
they
call
liberal
tendencies
i
believe
they
are
called
whigs
funny
name
is
not
it
it
means
perruque
i
think
candeille
has
given
charity
performances
in
aid
of
our
paris
poor
in
one
or
two
of
these
whig
clubs
and
incidentally
she
has
been
very
useful
to
us
a
woman
is
always
useful
in
such
cases
i
shall
seek
out
the
citizeness
candeille
and
if
she
renders
you
useful
assistance
i
think
i
can
offer
her
what
should
prove
a
tempting
prize
women
are
so
vain
he
added
contemplating
with
rapt
attention
the
enamel
-
like
polish
on
his
finger
-
nails
there
is
a
vacancy
in
the
maison
moliere
or
what
might
prove
more
attractive
still
in
connection
with
the
proposed
national
fete
and
the
new
religion
for
the
people
we
have
not
yet
chosen
a
goddess
of
reason
that
should
appeal
to
any
feminine
mind
the
impersonation
of
a
goddess
with
processions
pageants
and
the
rest
great
importance
and
prominence
given
to
one
personality
what
say
you
citizen
if
you
really
have
need
of
a
woman
for
the
furtherance
of
your
plans
you
have
that
at
your
disposal
which
may
enhance
her
zeal
i
thank
you
citizen
rejoined
chauvelin
calmly
i
always
entertained
a
hope
that
some
day
the
revolutionary
government
would
call
again
on
my
services
i
admit
that
i
failed
last
year
the
englishman
is
resourceful
he
has
wits
and
he
is
very
rich
he
would
not
have
succeeded
i
think
but
for
his
money
and
corruption
and
bribery
are
rife
in
paris
and
on
our
coasts
he
slipped
through
my
fingers
at
the
very
moment
when
i
thought
that
i
held
him
most
securely
i
do
admit
all
that
but
i
am
prepared
to
redeem
my
failure
of
last
year
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
discuss
i
am
ready
to
start
he
looked
round
for
his
cloak
and
hat
and
quietly
readjusted
the
set
of
his
neck
-
tie
but
robespierre
detained
him
a
while
longer
that
born
mountebank
born
torturer
of
the
souls
of
men
had
not
gloated
sufficiently
yet
on
the
agony
of
mind
of
this
fellow
-
man
chauvelin
had
always
been
trusted
and
respected
his
services
in
connection
with
the
foreign
affairs
of
the
revolutionary
government
had
been
invaluable
both
before
and
since
the
beginning
of
the
european
war
at
one
time
he
formed
part
of
that
merciless
decemvirate
which
with
robespierre
at
its
head
meant
to
govern
france
by
laws
of
bloodshed
and
of
unparalleled
ferocity
but
the
sea
-
green
incorruptible
had
since
tired
of
him
then
had
endeavoured
to
push
him
on
one
side
for
chauvelin
was
keen
and
clever
and
moreover
he
possessed
all
those
qualities
of
selfless
patriotism
which
were
so
conspicuously
lacking
in
robespierre
his
failure
in
bringing
that
interfering
scarlet
pimpernel
to
justice
and
the
guillotine
had
completed
chauvelin
'
s
downfall
though
not
otherwise
molested
he
had
been
left
to
moulder
in
obscurity
during
this
past
year
he
would
soon
enough
have
been
completely
forgotten
now
he
was
not
only
to
be
given
one
more
chance
to
regain
public
favour
but
he
had
demanded
powers
which
in
consideration
of
the
aim
in
view
robespierre
himself
could
not
refuse
to
grant
him
but
the
incorruptible
ever
envious
and
jealous
would
not
allow
him
to
exult
too
soon
with
characteristic
blandness
he
seemed
to
be
entering
into
all
chauvelin
'
s
schemes
to
be
helping
in
every
way
he
could
for
there
was
something
at
the
back
of
his
mind
which
he
meant
to
say
to
the
ex
-
ambassador
before
the
latter
took
his
leave
something
which
would
show
him
that
he
was
but
on
trial
once
again
and
which
would
demonstrate
to
him
with
perfect
clearness
that
over
him
there
hovered
the
all
-
powerful
hand
of
a
master
you
have
but
to
name
the
sum
you
want
citizen
chauvelin
said
the
incorruptible
with
an
encouraging
smile
the
government
will
not
stint
you
and
you
shall
not
fail
for
lack
of
authority
or
for
lack
of
funds
it
is
pleasant
to
hear
that
the
government
has
such
uncounted
wealth
remarked
chauvelin
with
dry
sarcasm
oh
the
last
few
weeks
have
been
very
profitable
retorted
robespierre
we
have
confiscated
money
and
jewels
from
emigrant
royalists
to
the
tune
of
several
million
francs
you
remember
the
traitor
juliette
marny
who
escape
to
england
lately
well
her
mother
'
s
jewels
and
quite
a
good
deal
of
gold
were
discovered
by
one
of
our
most
able
spies
to
be
under
the
care
of
a
certain
abbe
foucquet
a
calotin
from
boulogne
devoted
to
the
family
so
it
seems
yes
queried
chauvelin
indifferently
our
men
seized
the
jewels
and
gold
that
is
all
we
do
not
know
yet
what
we
mean
to
do
with
the
priest
the
fisherfolk
of
boulogne
like
him
and
we
can
lay
our
hands
on
him
at
any
time
if
we
want
his
old
head
for
the
guillotine
but
the
jewels
were
worth
having
there
'
s
a
historic
necklace
worth
half
a
million
at
least
could
i
have
it
asked
chauvelin
robespierre
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
said
it
belonged
to
the
marny
family
continued
the
ex
-
ambassador
juliette
marny
is
in
england
i
might
meet
her
i
cannot
tell
what
may
happen
but
i
feel
that
the
historic
necklace
might
prove
useful
just
as
you
please
he
added
with
renewed
indifference
it
was
a
thought
that
flashed
through
my
mind
when
you
spoke
nothing
more
and
to
show
you
how
thoroughly
the
government
trusts
you
citizen
chauvelin
replied
robespierre
with
perfect
urbanity
i
will
myself
direct
that
the
marny
necklace
be
placed
unreservedly
in
your
hands
and
a
sum
of
fifty
thousand
francs
for
your
expenses
in
england
you
see
he
added
blandly
we
give
you
no
excuse
for
a
second
failure
i
need
none
retorted
chauvelin
drily
as
he
finally
rose
from
his
seat
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
that
this
interview
was
ended
at
last
but
robespierre
too
had
risen
and
pushing
his
chair
aside
he
took
a
step
or
two
towards
chauvelin
he
was
a
much
taller
man
than
the
ex
-
ambassador
spare
and
gaunt
he
had
a
very
upright
bearing
and
in
the
uncertain
light
of
the
candle
he
seemed
to
tower
strangely
and
weirdly
above
the
other
man
the
pale
hue
of
his
coat
his
light
-
coloured
hair
the
whiteness
of
his
linen
all
helped
to
give
to
his
appearance
at
that
moment
a
curious
spectral
effect
chauvelin
somehow
felt
an
unpleasant
shiver
running
down
his
spine
as
robespierre
perfectly
urbane
and
gentle
in
his
manner
placed
a
long
bony
hand
upon
his
shoulder
citizen
chauvelin
said
the
incorruptible
with
some
degree
of
dignified
solemnity
meseems
that
we
very
quickly
understood
one
another
this
evening
your
own
conscience
no
doubt
gave
you
a
premonition
of
what
the
purport
of
my
summons
to
you
would
be
you
say
that
you
always
hoped
the
revolutionary
government
would
give
you
one
great
chance
to
redeem
your
failure
of
last
year
i
for
one
always
intended
that
you
should
have
that
chance
for
i
saw
perhaps
just
a
little
deeper
into
your
heart
than
my
colleagues
i
saw
not
only
enthusiasm
for
the
cause
of
the
people
of
france
not
only
abhorrence
for
the
enemy
of
your
country
i
saw
a
purely
personal
and
deadly
hate
of
an
individual
man
the
unknown
and
mysterious
englishman
who
proved
too
clever
for
you
last
year
and
because
i
believe
that
hatred
will
prove
sharper
and
more
far
-
seeing
than
selfless
patriotism
therefore
i
urged
the
committee
of
public
safety
to
allow
you
to
work
out
your
own
revenge
and
thereby
to
serve
your
country
more
effectually
than
any
other
perhaps
more
pure
-
minded
patriot
would
do
you
go
to
england
well
-
provided
with
all
that
is
necessary
for
the
success
of
your
plans
for
the
accomplishment
of
your
own
personal
vengeance
the
revolutionary
government
will
help
you
with
money
passports
safe
conducts
it
places
its
spies
and
agents
at
your
disposal
it
gives
you
practically
unlimited
power
wherever
you
may
go
it
will
not
enquire
into
your
motives
nor
yet
your
means
so
long
as
these
lead
to
success
but
private
vengeance
or
patriotism
whatever
may
actuate
you
we
here
in
france
demand
you
deliver
into
our
hands
the
man
who
is
known
in
two
countries
as
the
scarlet
pimpernel
we
want
him
alive
if
possible
or
dead
if
it
must
be
so
and
we
want
as
many
of
his
henchmen
as
will
follow
him
to
the
guillotine
get
them
to
france
and
we
will
know
how
to
deal
with
them
and
let
the
whole
of
europe
be
damned
he
paused
for
a
while
his
hand
still
resting
on
chauvelin
'
s
shoulder
his
pale
green
eyes
holding
those
of
the
other
man
as
if
in
a
trance
but
chauvelin
neither
stirred
nor
spoke
his
triumph
left
him
quite
calm
his
fertile
brain
was
already
busy
with
his
plans
there
was
no
room
for
fear
in
his
heart
and
it
was
without
the
slightest
tremor
that
he
waited
for
the
conclusion
of
robespierre
'
s
oration
perhaps
citizen
chauvelin
said
the
latter
at
last
you
have
already
guessed
what
there
is
left
for
me
to
say
but
lest
there
should
remain
in
your
mind
one
faint
glimmer
of
doubt
or
of
hope
let
me
tell
you
this
the
revolutionary
government
gives
you
this
chance
of
redeeming
your
failure
but
this
one
only
if
you
fail
again
your
outraged
country
will
know
neither
pardon
nor
mercy
whether
you
return
to
france
or
remain
in
england
whether
you
travel
north
south
east
or
west
cross
the
oceans
or
traverse
the
alps
the
hand
of
an
avenging
people
will
be
upon
you
your
second
failure
will
be
punished
by
death
wherever
you
may
be
either
by
the
guillotine
if
you
are
in
france
or
if
you
seek
refuge
elsewhere
then
by
the
hand
of
an
assassin
look
to
it
citizen
chauvelin
for
there
will
be
no
escape
this
time
not
even
if
the
mightiest
tyrant
on
earth
tried
to
protect
you
not
even
if
you
succeeded
in
building
up
an
empire
and
placing
yourself
upon
a
throne
his
thin
strident
voice
echoed
weirdly
in
the
small
close
boudoir
chauvelin
made
no
reply
there
was
nothing
that
he
could
say
all
that
robespierre
had
put
so
emphatically
before
him
he
had
fully
realised
even
whilst
he
was
forming
his
most
daring
plans
it
was
an
either
or
this
time
uttered
to
him
now
he
thought
again
of
marguerite
blakeney
and
the
terrible
alternative
he
had
put
before
her
less
than
a
year
ago
well
he
was
prepared
to
take
the
risk
he
would
not
fail
again
he
was
going
to
england
under
more
favourable
conditions
this
time
he
knew
who
the
man
was
whom
he
was
bidden
to
lure
to
france
and
to
death
and
he
returned
robespierre
'
s
threatening
gaze
boldly
and
unflinchingly
then
he
prepared
to
go
he
took
up
his
hat
and
cloak
opened
the
door
and
peered
for
a
moment
into
the
dark
corridor
wherein
in
the
far
distance
the
steps
of
a
solitary
sentinel
could
be
faintly
heard
he
put
on
his
hat
turned
to
look
once
more
into
the
room
where
robespierre
stood
quietly
watching
him
and
went
his
way
it
was
perhaps
the
most
brilliant
september
ever
known
in
england
where
the
last
days
of
dying
summer
are
nearly
always
golden
and
beautiful
strange
that
in
this
country
where
that
same
season
is
so
peculiarly
radiant
with
a
glory
all
its
own
there
should
be
no
special
expression
in
the
language
with
which
to
accurately
name
it
so
we
needs
must
call
it
fin
d
'
ete
the
ending
of
the
summer
not
the
absolute
end
nor
yet
the
ultimate
departure
but
the
tender
lingering
of
a
friend
obliged
to
leave
us
anon
yet
who
fain
would
steal
a
day
here
and
there
a
week
or
so
in
which
to
stay
with
us
who
would
make
that
last
pathetic
farewell
of
his
endure
a
little
while
longer
still
and
brings
forth
in
gorgeous
array
for
our
final
gaze
all
that
he
has
which
is
most
luxuriant
most
desirable
most
worthy
of
regret
and
in
this
year
of
grace
1793
departing
summer
had
lavished
the
treasures
of
her
palette
upon
woodland
and
river
banks
had
tinged
the
once
crude
green
of
larch
and
elm
with
a
tender
hue
of
gold
had
brushed
the
oaks
with
tones
of
warm
russet
and
put
patches
of
sienna
and
crimson
on
the
beech
in
the
gardens
the
roses
were
still
in
bloom
not
the
delicate
blush
or
lemon
ones
of
june
nor
yet
the
pale
banksias
and
climbers
but
the
full
-
blooded
red
roses
of
late
summer
and
deep
-
coloured
apricot
ones
with
crinkled
outside
leaves
faintly
kissed
by
the
frosty
dew
in
sheltered
spots
the
purple
clematis
still
lingered
whilst
the
dahlias
brilliant
of
hue
seemed
overbearing
in
their
gorgeous
insolence
flaunting
their
crudely
colored
petals
against
sober
backgrounds
of
mellow
leaves
or
the
dull
mossy
tones
of
ancient
encircling
walls
the
gala
had
always
been
held
about
the
end
of
september
the
weather
on
the
riverside
was
most
dependable
then
and
there
was
always
sufficient
sunshine
as
an
excuse
for
bringing
out
madam
'
s
last
new
muslin
gown
or
her
pale
-
coloured
quilted
petticoat
then
the
ground
was
dry
and
hard
good
alike
for
walking
and
for
setting
up
tents
and
booths
and
of
these
there
was
of
a
truth
a
most
goodly
array
this
year
mountebanks
and
jugglers
from
every
corner
of
the
world
so
it
seemed
for
there
was
a
man
with
a
face
as
black
as
my
lord
'
s
tricorne
and
another
with
such
flat
yellow
cheeks
as
made
one
think
of
batter
pudding
and
spring
aconite
of
eggs
and
other
very
yellow
things
there
was
a
tent
wherein
dogs
all
sorts
of
dogs
big
little
black
white
or
tan
did
things
which
no
christian
with
respect
for
his
own
backbone
would
have
dared
to
perform
and
another
where
a
weird
-
faced
old
man
made
bean
-
stalks
and
walking
sticks
coins
of
the
realm
and
lace
kerchiefs
vanish
into
thin
air
and
as
it
was
nice
and
hot
one
could
sit
out
upon
the
green
and
listen
to
the
strains
of
the
band
which
discoursed
sweet
music
and
watch
the
young
people
tread
a
measure
on
the
sward
the
quality
had
not
yet
arrived
for
humbler
folk
had
partaken
of
very
early
dinner
so
as
to
get
plenty
of
fun
and
long
hours
of
delight
for
the
sixpenny
toll
demanded
at
the
gates
there
was
so
much
to
see
and
so
much
to
do
games
of
bowls
on
the
green
and
a
beautiful
aunt
sally
there
was
a
skittle
alley
and
two
merry
-
go
-
rounds
there
were
performing
monkeys
and
dancing
bears
a
woman
so
fat
that
three
men
with
arms
outstretched
could
not
get
round
her
and
a
man
so
thin
that
he
could
put
a
lady
'
s
bracelet
round
his
neck
and
her
garter
around
his
waist
there
were
some
funny
little
dwarfs
with
pinched
faces
and
a
knowing
manner
and
a
giant
come
all
the
way
from
russia
so
'
twas
said
the
mechanical
toys
too
were
a
great
attraction
you
dropped
a
penny
into
a
little
slit
in
a
box
and
a
doll
would
begin
to
dance
and
play
the
fiddle
and
there
was
the
magic
mill
where
for
another
modest
copper
a
row
of
tiny
figures
wrinkled
and
old
and
dressed
in
the
shabbiest
of
rags
marched
in
weary
procession
up
a
flight
of
steps
into
the
mill
only
to
emerge
again
the
next
moment
at
a
further
door
of
this
wonderful
building
looking
young
and
gay
dressed
in
gorgeous
finery
and
tripping
a
dance
measure
as
they
descended
some
steps
and
were
finally
lost
to
view
but
what
was
most
wonderful
of
all
and
collected
the
goodliest
crowd
of
gazers
and
the
largest
amount
of
coins
was
a
miniature
representation
of
what
was
going
on
in
france
even
at
this
very
moment
and
you
could
not
help
but
be
convinced
of
the
truth
of
it
all
so
cleverly
was
it
done
there
was
a
background
of
houses
and
a
very
red
-
looking
sky
too
red
some
people
said
but
were
immediately
quashed
by
the
dictum
of
the
wise
that
the
sky
represented
a
sunset
as
anyone
who
looked
could
see
then
there
were
a
number
of
little
figures
no
taller
than
your
hand
but
with
little
wooden
faces
and
arms
and
legs
just
beautifully
made
little
dolls
and
these
were
dressed
in
kirtles
and
breeches
all
rags
mostly
and
little
coats
and
wooden
shoes
they
were
massed
together
in
groups
with
their
arms
all
turned
upwards
and
in
the
center
of
this
little
stage
on
an
elevated
platform
there
were
miniature
wooden
posts
close
together
and
with
a
long
flat
board
at
right
angles
at
the
foot
of
the
posts
and
all
painted
a
bright
red
at
the
further
end
of
the
boards
was
a
miniature
basket
and
between
the
two
posts
at
the
top
was
a
miniature
knife
which
ran
up
and
down
in
a
groove
and
was
drawn
by
a
miniature
pulley
folk
who
knew
said
that
this
was
a
model
of
a
guillotine
and
lo
and
behold
when
you
dropped
a
penny
into
a
slot
just
below
the
wooden
stage
the
crowd
of
little
figures
started
waving
their
arms
up
and
down
and
another
little
doll
would
ascend
the
elevated
platform
and
lie
down
on
the
red
board
at
the
foot
of
the
wooden
posts
then
a
figure
dressed
in
brilliant
scarlet
put
out
an
arm
presumably
to
touch
the
pulley
and
the
tiny
knife
would
rattle
down
on
to
the
poor
little
reclining
doll
'
s
neck
and
its
head
would
roll
off
into
the
basket
beyond
then
there
was
a
loud
whirr
of
wheels
a
buzz
of
internal
mechanism
and
all
the
little
figures
would
stop
dead
with
arms
outstretched
whilst
the
beheaded
doll
rolled
off
the
board
and
was
lost
to
view
no
doubt
preparatory
to
going
through
the
same
gruesome
pantomime
again
it
was
very
thrilling
and
very
terrible
a
certain
air
of
hushed
awe
reigned
in
the
booth
where
this
mechanical
wonder
was
displayed
the
booth
itself
stood
in
a
secluded
portion
of
the
grounds
far
from
the
toll
gates
and
the
band
stand
and
the
noise
of
the
merry
-
go
-
round
and
there
were
great
texts
written
in
red
letters
on
a
black
ground
pinned
all
along
the
walls
please
spare
a
copper
for
the
starving
poor
of
paris
a
lady
dressed
in
grey
quilted
petticoat
and
pretty
grey
and
black
striped
paniers
could
be
seen
walking
in
the
booth
from
time
to
time
then
disappearing
through
a
partition
beyond
she
would
emerge
again
presently
carrying
an
embroidered
reticule
and
would
wander
round
among
the
crowd
holding
out
the
bag
by
its
chain
and
repeating
in
tones
of
somewhat
monotonous
appeal
for
the
starving
poor
of
paris
if
you
please
she
had
fine
dark
eyes
rather
narrow
and
tending
upwards
at
the
outer
corners
which
gave
her
face
a
not
altogether
pleasant
expression
still
they
were
fine
eyes
and
when
she
went
round
soliciting
alms
most
of
the
men
put
a
hand
into
their
breeches
pocket
and
dropped
a
coin
into
her
embroidered
reticule
she
said
the
word
poor
in
rather
a
funny
way
rolling
the
r
at
the
end
and
she
also
said
please
as
if
it
were
spelt
with
a
long
line
of
e
'
s
and
so
it
was
concluded
that
she
was
french
and
was
begging
for
her
poorer
sisters
at
stated
intervals
during
the
day
the
mechanical
toy
was
rolled
into
a
corner
and
the
lady
in
grey
stood
up
on
a
platform
and
sang
queer
little
songs
the
words
of
which
nobody
could
understand
il
etait
une
bergere
et
ron
et
petit
pataplon
but
it
all
left
an
impression
of
sadness
and
of
suppressed
awe
upon
the
minds
and
susceptibilities
of
the
worthy
richmond
yokels
come
with
their
wives
or
sweethearts
to
enjoy
the
fun
of
the
fair
and
gladly
did
everyone
emerge
out
of
that
melancholy
booth
into
the
sunshine
the
brightness
and
the
noise
lud
but
she
do
give
me
the
creeps
said
mistress
polly
the
pretty
barmaid
from
the
bell
inn
down
by
the
river
and
i
must
say
that
i
do
not
see
why
we
english
folk
should
send
our
hard
-
earned
pennies
to
those
murdering
ruffians
over
the
water
bein
'
starving
so
to
speak
do
not
make
a
murderer
a
better
man
if
he
goes
on
murdering
she
added
with
undisputable
if
ungrammatical
logic
come
let
'
s
look
at
something
more
cheerful
now
and
without
waiting
for
anyone
else
'
s
assent
she
turned
towards
the
more
lively
portion
of
the
grounds
closely
followed
by
a
ruddy
-
faced
somewhat
sheepish
-
looking
youth
who
very
obviously
was
her
attendant
swain
it
was
getting
on
for
three
o
-
clock
now
and
the
quality
were
beginning
to
arrive
lord
anthony
dewhurst
was
already
there
chucking
every
pretty
girl
under
the
chin
to
the
annoyance
of
her
beau
ladies
were
arriving
all
the
time
and
the
humbler
feminine
hearts
were
constantly
set
a
-
flutter
at
sight
of
rich
brocaded
gowns
and
the
new
charlottes
all
crinkled
velvet
and
soft
marabout
which
were
so
becoming
to
the
pretty
faces
beneath
there
was
incessant
and
loud
talking
and
chattering
with
here
and
there
the
shriller
tones
of
a
french
voice
being
distinctly
noticeable
in
the
din
there
were
a
good
many
french
ladies
and
gentlemen
present
easily
recognisable
even
in
the
distance
for
their
clothes
were
of
more
sober
hue
and
of
lesser
richness
than
those
of
their
english
compeers
but
they
were
great
lords
and
ladies
nevertheless
dukes
and
duchesses
and
countesses
come
to
england
for
fear
of
being
murdered
by
those
devils
in
their
own
country
richmond
was
full
of
them
just
now
as
they
were
made
right
welcome
both
at
the
palace
and
at
the
magnificent
home
of
sir
percy
and
lady
blakeney
ah
here
comes
sir
andrew
ffoulkes
with
his
lady
so
pretty
and
dainty
does
she
look
like
a
little
china
doll
in
her
new
-
fashioned
short
-
waisted
gown
her
brown
hair
in
soft
waves
above
her
smooth
forehead
her
great
hazel
eyes
fixed
in
unaffected
admiration
on
the
gallant
husband
by
her
side
no
wonder
she
dotes
on
him
signed
pretty
mistress
polly
after
she
had
bobbed
her
curtsy
to
my
lady
the
brave
deeds
he
did
for
love
of
her
rescued
her
from
those
murderers
over
in
france
and
brought
her
to
england
safe
and
sound
having
fought
no
end
of
them
single
-
handed
so
i
'
ve
beard
it
said
have
you
not
master
thomas
jezzard
and
she
looked
defiantly
at
her
meek
-
looking
cavalier
bah
replied
master
thomas
with
quite
unusual
vehemence
in
response
to
the
disparaging
look
in
her
brown
eyes
'
tis
not
he
who
did
it
all
as
you
well
know
mistress
polly
sir
andrew
ffoulkes
is
a
gallant
gentleman
you
may
take
your
bible
oath
on
that
but
he
that
fights
the
murdering
frogeaters
single
-
handed
is
he
whom
they
call
the
scarlet
pimpernel
the
bravest
gentleman
in
all
the
world
then
as
at
mention
of
the
national
hero
he
thought
that
he
detected
in
mistress
polly
'
s
eyes
an
enthusiasm
which
he
could
not
very
well
ascribe
to
his
own
individuality
he
added
with
some
pique
but
they
do
say
that
this
same
scarlet
pimpernel
is
mightily
ill
-
favoured
and
that
'
s
why
no
one
ever
sees
him
they
say
he
is
fit
to
scare
the
crows
away
and
that
no
frenchy
can
look
twice
at
his
face
for
it
is
so
ugly
and
so
they
let
him
get
out
of
the
country
rather
than
look
at
him
again
then
they
do
say
a
mighty
lot
of
nonsense
retorted
mistress
polly
with
a
shrug
of
her
pretty
shoulders
and
if
that
be
so
then
why
do
not
you
go
over
to
france
and
join
hands
with
the
scarlet
pimpernel
i
will
warrant
no
frenchman
will
want
to
look
twice
at
your
face
a
chorus
of
laughter
greeted
this
sally
for
the
two
young
people
had
in
the
meanwhile
been
joined
by
several
of
their
friends
and
now
formed
part
of
a
merry
group
near
the
band
some
sitting
others
standing
but
all
bent
on
seeing
as
much
as
there
was
to
see
in
richmond
gala
this
day
there
was
johnny
cullen
the
grocer
'
s
apprentice
from
twickenham
and
ursula
quekett
the
baker
'
s
daughter
and
several
young
'
uns
from
the
neighbourhood
as
well
as
some
older
folk
and
all
of
them
enjoyed
a
joke
when
they
heard
one
and
thought
mistress
polly
'
s
retort
mightily
smart
but
then
mistress
polly
was
possessed
of
two
hundred
pounds
all
her
own
left
to
her
by
her
grandmother
and
on
the
strength
of
this
extensive
fortune
had
acquired
a
reputation
for
beauty
and
wit
not
easily
accorded
to
a
wench
that
had
been
penniless
but
mistress
polly
was
also
very
kind
-
hearted
she
loved
to
tease
master
jezzard
who
was
an
indefatigable
hanger
-
on
at
her
pretty
skirts
and
whose
easy
conquest
had
rendered
her
somewhat
contemptuous
but
at
the
look
of
perplexed
annoyance
and
bewildered
distress
in
the
lad
'
s
face
her
better
nature
soon
got
the
upper
hand
she
realized
that
her
remark
had
been
unwarrantably
spiteful
and
wishing
to
make
atonement
she
said
with
a
touch
of
coquetry
which
quickly
spread
balm
over
the
honest
yokel
'
s
injured
vanity
la
master
jezzard
you
do
seem
to
make
a
body
say
some
queer
things
but
there
you
must
own
'
tis
mighty
funny
about
that
scarlet
pimpernel
she
added
appealing
to
the
company
in
general
just
as
if
master
jezzard
had
been
disputing
the
fact
why
wo
not
he
let
anyone
see
who
he
is
and
those
who
know
him
wo
not
tell
now
i
have
it
for
a
fact
from
my
lady
'
s
own
maid
lucy
that
the
young
lady
as
is
stopping
at
lady
blakeney
'
s
house
has
actually
spoken
to
the
man
she
came
over
from
france
come
a
fortnight
to
-
morrow
she
and
the
gentleman
they
call
mossoo
deroulede
they
both
saw
the
scarlet
pimpernel
and
spoke
to
him
he
brought
them
over
from
france
they
why
wo
not
they
say
say
what
commented
johnny
cullen
the
apprentice
who
this
mysterious
scarlet
pimpernel
is
perhaps
he
is
not
said
old
clutterbuck
who
was
clerk
of
the
vestry
at
the
church
of
st
john
'
s
the
evangelist
yes
he
added
sententiously
for
he
was
fond
of
his
own
sayings
and
usually
liked
to
repeat
them
before
he
had
quite
done
with
them
that
'
s
it
you
may
be
sure
perhaps
he
is
not
what
do
you
mean
master
clutterbuck
asked
ursula
quekett
for
she
knew
the
old
man
liked
to
explain
his
wise
saws
and
as
she
wanted
to
marry
his
son
she
indulged
him
whenever
she
could
what
do
you
mean
he
is
not
what
he
is
not
that
'
s
all
explained
clutterbuck
with
vague
solemnity
then
seeing
that
he
had
gained
the
attention
of
the
little
party
round
him
he
condescended
to
come
to
more
logical
phraseology
i
mean
that
perhaps
we
must
not
ask
'
who
is
this
mysterious
scarlet
pimpernel
but
who
was
that
poor
and
unfortunate
gentleman
'
then
you
think
suggested
mistress
polly
who
felt
unaccountably
low
-
spirited
at
this
oratorical
pronouncement
i
have
it
for
a
fact
said
mr
clutterbuck
solemnly
that
he
whom
they
call
the
scarlet
pimpernel
no
longer
exists
now
that
he
was
collared
by
the
frenchies
as
far
back
as
last
fall
and
in
the
language
of
the
poets
has
never
been
heard
of
no
more
mr
clutterbuck
was
very
fond
of
quoting
from
the
works
of
certain
writers
whose
names
he
never
mentioned
but
who
went
by
the
poetical
generality
of
the
poets
whenever
he
made
use
of
phrases
which
he
was
supposed
to
derive
from
these
great
and
unnamed
authors
he
solemnly
and
mechanically
raised
his
hat
as
a
tribute
of
respect
to
these
giant
minds
you
think
that
the
scarlet
pimpernel
is
dead
mr
clutterbuck
that
those
horrible
frenchies
murdered
him
surely
you
do
not
mean
that
sighed
mistress
polly
ruefully
mr
clutterbuck
put
his
hand
up
to
his
hat
preparatory
no
doubt
to
making
another
appeal
to
the
mysterious
poets
but
was
interrupted
in
the
very
act
of
uttering
great
thoughts
by
a
loud
and
prolonged
laugh
which
came
echoing
from
a
distant
corner
of
the
grounds
lud
but
i
'
d
know
that
laugh
anywhere
said
mistress
quekett
whilst
all
eyes
were
turned
in
the
direction
whence
the
merry
noise
had
come
half
a
head
taller
than
any
of
his
friends
around
him
his
lazy
blue
eyes
scanning
from
beneath
their
drooping
lids
the
motley
throng
around
him
stood
sir
percy
blakeney
the
centre
of
a
gaily
-
dressed
little
group
which
seemingly
had
just
crossed
the
toll
-
gate
a
fine
specimen
of
a
man
for
sure
remarked
johnnie
cullen
the
apprentice
aye
you
may
take
your
bible
oath
on
that
sighed
mistress
polly
who
was
inclined
to
be
sentimental
speakin
'
as
the
poets
pronounced
mr
clutterbuck
sententiously
inches
do
not
make
a
man
nor
fine
clothes
neither
added
master
jezzard
who
did
not
approve
of
mistress
polly
'
s
sentimental
sigh
there
'
s
my
lady
gasped
miss
barbara
suddenly
clutching
master
clutterbuck
'
s
arm
vigorously
lud
but
she
is
beautiful
to
-
day
beautiful
indeed
and
radiant
with
youth
and
happiness
marguerite
blakeney
had
just
gone
through
the
gates
and
was
walking
along
the
sward
towards
the
band
stand
she
was
dressed
in
clinging
robes
of
shimmery
green
texture
the
new
-
fashioned
high
-
waisted
effect
suiting
her
graceful
figure
to
perfection
the
large
charlotte
made
of
velvet
to
match
the
gown
cast
a
deep
shadow
over
the
upper
part
of
her
face
and
gave
a
peculiar
softness
to
the
outline
of
her
forehead
and
cheeks
long
lace
mittens
covered
her
arms
and
hands
and
a
scarf
of
diaphanous
material
edged
with
dull
gold
hung
loosely
around
her
shoulders
yes
she
was
beautiful
no
captious
chronicler
has
ever
denied
that
and
no
one
who
knew
her
before
and
who
saw
her
again
on
this
late
summer
'
s
afternoon
could
fail
to
mark
the
additional
charm
of
her
magnetic
personality
there
was
a
tenderness
in
her
face
as
she
turned
her
head
to
and
fro
a
joy
of
living
in
her
eyes
that
was
quite
irresistibly
fascinating
just
now
she
was
talking
animatedly
with
the
young
girl
who
was
walking
beside
her
and
laughing
merrily
the
while
nay
we
will
find
your
paul
never
fear
lud
child
have
you
forgotten
he
is
in
england
now
and
that
there
'
s
no
fear
of
his
being
kidnapped
here
on
the
green
in
broad
daylight
the
young
girl
gave
a
slight
shudder
and
her
child
-
like
face
became
a
shade
paler
than
before
marguerite
took
her
hand
and
gave
it
a
kindly
pressure
juliette
marny
but
lately
come
to
england
saved
from
under
the
very
knife
of
the
guillotine
by
a
timely
and
daring
rescue
could
scarcely
believe
as
yet
that
she
and
the
man
she
loved
were
really
out
of
danger
there
is
monsieur
deroulede
said
marguerite
after
a
slight
pause
giving
the
young
girl
time
to
recover
herself
and
pointing
to
a
group
of
men
close
by
he
is
among
friends
as
you
see
they
made
such
a
pretty
picture
these
two
women
as
they
stood
together
for
a
moment
on
the
green
with
the
brilliant
september
sun
throwing
golden
reflections
and
luminous
shadows
on
their
slender
forms
marguerite
tall
and
queen
-
like
in
her
rich
gown
and
costly
jewels
wearing
with
glorious
pride
the
invisible
crown
of
happy
wifehood
juliette
slim
and
girlish
dressed
all
in
white
with
a
soft
straw
hat
on
her
fair
curls
and
bearing
on
an
otherwise
young
and
child
-
like
face
the
hard
imprint
of
the
terrible
sufferings
she
had
undergone
of
the
deathly
moral
battle
her
tender
soul
had
had
to
fight
soon
a
group
of
friends
joined
them
paul
deroulede
among
these
also
sir
andrew
and
lady
ffoulkes
and
strolling
slowly
towards
them
his
hands
buried
in
the
pockets
of
his
fine
cloth
breeches
his
broad
shoulders
set
to
advantage
in
a
coat
of
immaculate
cut
priceless
lace
ruffles
at
neck
and
wrist
came
the
inimitable
sir
percy
to
all
appearances
