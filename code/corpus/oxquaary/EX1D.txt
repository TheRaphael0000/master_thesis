the
next
day
,
sabbath
,
august
27th
,
i
had
the
occasion
i
had
long
looked
forward
to
,
to
hear
some
of
the
famous
edinburgh
preachers
,
all
well
known
to
me
already
by
the
report
of
mr
campbell
.
alas
!
and
i
might
just
as
well
have
been
at
essendean
,
and
sitting
under
mr
campbell
'
s
worthy
self
!
the
turmoil
of
my
thoughts
,
which
dwelt
continually
on
the
interview
with
prestongrange
,
inhibiting
me
from
all
attention
.
i
was
indeed
much
less
impressed
by
the
reasoning
of
the
divines
than
by
the
spectacle
of
the
thronged
congregation
in
the
churches
,
like
what
i
imagined
of
a
theatre
or
(
in
my
then
disposition
)
of
an
assize
of
trial
;
above
all
at
the
west
kirk
,
with
its
three
tiers
of
galleries
,
where
i
went
in
the
vain
hope
that
i
might
see
miss
drummond
.
on
the
monday
i
betook
me
for
the
first
time
to
a
barber
'
s
,
and
was
very
well
pleased
with
the
result
.
thence
to
the
advocate
'
s
,
where
the
red
coats
of
the
soldiers
showed
again
about
his
door
,
making
a
bright
place
in
the
close
.
i
looked
about
for
the
young
lady
and
her
gillies
:
there
was
never
a
sign
of
them
.
but
i
was
no
sooner
shown
into
the
cabinet
or
antechamber
where
i
had
spent
so
wearyful
a
time
upon
the
saturday
,
than
i
was
aware
of
the
tall
figure
of
james
more
in
a
corner
.
he
seemed
a
prey
to
a
painful
uneasiness
,
reaching
forth
his
feet
and
hands
,
and
his
eyes
speeding
here
and
there
without
rest
about
the
walls
of
the
small
chamber
,
which
recalled
to
me
with
a
sense
of
pity
the
man
'
s
wretched
situation
.
i
suppose
it
was
partly
this
,
and
partly
my
strong
continuing
interest
in
his
daughter
,
that
moved
me
to
accost
him
.
"
give
you
a
good
-
morning
,
sir
,
"
said
i
.
"
and
a
good
-
morning
to
you
,
sir
,
"
said
he
.
"
you
bide
tryst
with
prestongrange
?
"
i
asked
.
"
i
do
,
sir
,
and
i
pray
your
business
with
that
gentleman
be
more
agreeable
than
mine
,
"
was
his
reply
.
"
i
hope
at
least
that
yours
will
be
brief
,
for
i
suppose
you
pass
before
me
,
"
said
i
.
"
all
pass
before
me
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
shrug
and
a
gesture
upward
of
the
open
hands
.
"
it
was
not
always
so
,
sir
,
but
times
change
.
it
was
not
so
when
the
sword
was
in
the
scale
,
young
gentleman
,
and
the
virtues
of
the
soldier
might
sustain
themselves
.
"
there
came
a
kind
of
highland
snuffle
out
of
the
man
that
raised
my
dander
strangely
.
"
well
,
mr
macgregor
,
"
said
i
,
"
i
understand
the
main
thing
for
a
soldier
is
to
be
silent
,
and
the
first
of
his
virtues
never
to
complain
.
"
"
you
have
my
name
,
i
perceive
"
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
bowed
to
me
with
his
arms
crossed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
though
it
is
one
i
must
not
use
myself
.
well
,
there
is
a
publicity
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
have
shown
my
face
and
told
my
name
too
often
in
the
beards
of
my
enemies
.
i
must
not
wonder
if
both
should
be
known
to
many
that
i
know
not
.
"
"
that
you
know
not
in
the
least
,
sir
,
"
said
i
,
"
nor
yet
anybody
else
;
but
the
name
i
am
called
,
if
you
care
to
hear
it
,
is
balfour
.
"
"
it
is
a
good
name
,
"
he
replied
,
civilly
;
"
there
are
many
decent
folk
that
use
it
.
and
now
that
i
call
to
mind
,
there
was
a
young
gentleman
,
your
namesake
,
that
marched
surgeon
in
the
year
'
45
with
my
battalion
.
"
"
i
believe
that
would
be
a
brother
to
balfour
of
baith
,
"
said
i
,
for
i
was
ready
for
the
surgeon
now
.
"
the
same
,
sir
,
"
said
james
more
.
"
and
since
i
have
been
fellow
-
soldier
with
your
kinsman
,
you
must
suffer
me
to
grasp
your
hand
.
"
he
shook
hands
with
me
long
and
tenderly
,
beaming
on
me
the
while
as
though
he
had
found
a
brother
.
"
ah
!
"
says
he
,
"
these
are
changed
days
since
your
cousin
and
i
heard
the
balls
whistle
in
our
lugs
.
"
"
i
think
he
was
a
very
far
-
away
cousin
,
"
said
i
,
drily
,
"
and
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
i
never
clapped
eyes
upon
the
man
.
"
"
well
,
well
,
"
said
he
,
"
it
makes
no
change
.
and
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
do
not
think
you
were
out
yourself
,
sir
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
have
no
clear
mind
of
your
face
,
which
is
one
not
probable
to
be
forgotten
.
"
"
in
the
year
you
refer
to
,
mr
macgregor
,
i
was
getting
skelped
in
the
parish
school
,
"
said
i
.
"
so
young
!
"
cries
he
.
"
ah
,
then
,
you
will
never
be
able
to
think
what
this
meeting
is
to
me
.
in
the
hour
of
my
adversity
,
and
here
in
the
house
of
my
enemy
,
to
meet
in
with
the
blood
of
an
old
brother
-
in
-
arms
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
it
heartens
me
,
mr
balfour
,
like
the
skirting
of
the
highland
pipes
!
sir
,
this
is
a
sad
look
back
that
many
of
us
have
to
make
:
some
with
falling
tears
.
i
have
lived
in
my
own
country
like
a
king
;
my
sword
,
my
mountains
,
and
the
faith
of
my
friends
and
kinsmen
sufficed
for
me
.
now
i
lie
in
a
stinking
dungeon
;
and
do
you
know
,
mr
balfour
,
"
he
went
on
,
taking
my
arm
and
beginning
to
lead
me
about
,
"
do
you
know
,
sir
,
that
i
lack
mere
necessaries
?
the
malice
of
my
foes
has
quite
sequestered
my
resources
.
i
lie
,
as
you
know
,
sir
,
on
a
trumped
-
up
charge
,
of
which
i
am
as
innocent
as
yourself
.
they
dare
not
bring
me
to
my
trial
,
and
in
the
meanwhile
i
am
held
naked
in
my
prison
.
i
could
have
wished
it
was
your
cousin
i
had
met
,
or
his
brother
baith
himself
.
either
would
,
i
know
,
have
been
rejoiced
to
help
me
;
while
a
comparative
stranger
like
yourself
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
i
would
be
ashamed
to
set
down
all
he
poured
out
to
me
in
this
beggarly
vein
,
or
the
very
short
and
grudging
answers
that
i
made
to
him
.
there
were
times
when
i
was
tempted
to
stop
his
mouth
with
some
small
change
;
but
whether
it
was
from
shame
or
pride
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
whether
it
was
for
my
own
sake
or
catriona
'
s
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
whether
it
was
because
i
thought
him
no
fit
father
for
his
daughter
,
or
because
i
resented
that
grossness
of
immediate
falsity
that
clung
about
the
man
himself
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
thing
was
clean
beyond
me
.
and
i
was
still
being
wheedled
and
preached
to
,
and
still
being
marched
to
and
fro
,
three
steps
and
a
turn
,
in
that
small
chamber
,
and
had
already
,
by
some
very
short
replies
,
highly
incensed
,
although
not
finally
discouraged
,
my
beggar
,
when
prestongrange
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
bade
me
eagerly
into
his
big
chamber
.
"
i
have
a
moment
'
s
engagements
,
"
said
he
;
"
and
that
you
may
not
sit
empty
-
handed
i
am
going
to
present
you
to
my
three
braw
daughters
,
of
whom
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
,
for
i
think
they
are
more
famous
than
papa
.
this
way
.
"
he
led
me
into
another
long
room
above
,
where
a
dry
old
lady
sat
at
a
frame
of
embroidery
,
and
the
three
handsomest
young
women
(
i
suppose
)
in
scotland
stood
together
by
a
window
.
"
this
is
my
new
friend
,
mr
balfour
,
"
said
he
,
presenting
me
by
the
arm
,
"
david
,
here
is
my
sister
,
miss
grant
,
who
is
so
good
as
keep
my
house
for
me
,
and
will
be
very
pleased
if
she
can
help
you
.
and
here
,
"
says
he
,
turning
to
the
three
younger
ladies
,
"
here
are
my
three
braw
dauchters
.
a
fair
question
to
ye
,
mr
davie
:
which
of
the
three
is
the
best
favoured
?
and
i
wager
he
will
never
have
the
impudence
to
propound
honest
alan
ramsay
'
s
answer
!
"
hereupon
all
three
,
and
the
old
miss
grant
as
well
,
cried
out
against
this
sally
,
which
(
as
i
was
acquainted
with
the
verses
he
referred
to
)
brought
shame
into
my
own
check
.
it
seemed
to
me
a
citation
unpardonable
in
a
father
,
and
i
was
amazed
that
these
ladies
could
laugh
even
while
they
reproved
,
or
made
believe
to
.
under
cover
of
this
mirth
,
prestongrange
got
forth
of
the
chamber
,
and
i
was
left
,
like
a
fish
upon
dry
land
,
in
that
very
unsuitable
society
.
i
could
never
deny
,
in
looking
back
upon
what
followed
,
that
i
was
eminently
stockish
;
and
i
must
say
the
ladies
were
well
drilled
to
have
so
long
a
patience
with
me
.
the
aunt
indeed
sat
close
at
her
embroidery
,
only
looking
now
and
again
and
smiling
;
but
the
misses
,
and
especially
the
eldest
,
who
was
besides
the
most
handsome
,
paid
me
a
score
of
attentions
which
i
was
very
ill
able
to
repay
.
it
was
all
in
vain
to
tell
myself
i
was
a
young
follow
of
some
worth
as
well
as
a
good
estate
,
and
had
no
call
to
feel
abashed
before
these
lasses
,
the
eldest
not
so
much
older
than
myself
,
and
no
one
of
them
by
any
probability
half
as
learned
.
reasoning
would
not
change
the
fact
;
and
there
were
times
when
the
colour
came
into
my
face
to
think
i
was
shaved
that
day
for
the
first
time
.
the
talk
going
,
with
all
their
endeavours
,
very
heavily
,
the
eldest
took
pity
on
my
awkwardness
,
sat
down
to
her
instrument
,
of
which
she
was
a
passed
mistress
,
and
entertained
me
for
a
while
with
playing
and
singing
,
both
in
the
scots
and
in
the
italian
manners
;
this
put
me
more
at
my
ease
,
and
being
reminded
of
alan
'
s
air
that
he
had
taught
me
in
the
hole
near
carriden
,
i
made
so
bold
as
to
whistle
a
bar
or
two
,
and
ask
if
she
knew
that
.
she
shook
her
head
.
"
i
never
heard
a
note
of
it
,
"
said
she
.
"
whistle
it
all
through
.
and
now
once
again
,
"
she
added
,
after
i
had
done
so
.
then
she
picked
it
out
upon
the
keyboard
,
and
(
to
my
surprise
)
instantly
enriched
the
same
with
well
-
sounding
chords
,
and
sang
,
as
she
played
,
with
a
very
droll
expression
and
broad
accent
-
"
haenae
i
got
just
the
lilt
of
it
?
isnae
this
the
tune
that
ye
whustled
?
"
"
you
see
,
"
she
says
,
"
i
can
do
the
poetry
too
,
only
it
wo
not
rhyme
.
and
then
again
:
"
i
am
miss
grant
,
sib
to
the
advocate
:
you
,
i
believe
,
are
dauvit
balfour
.
"
i
told
her
how
much
astonished
i
was
by
her
genius
.
"
and
what
do
you
call
the
name
of
it
?
"
she
asked
.
"
i
do
not
know
the
real
name
,
"
said
i
.
"
i
just
call
it
alan
'
s
air
.
"
she
looked
at
me
directly
in
the
face
.
"
i
shall
call
it
david
'
s
air
,
"
said
she
;
"
though
if
it
is
the
least
like
what
your
namesake
of
israel
played
to
saul
i
would
never
wonder
that
the
king
got
little
good
by
it
,
for
it
is
but
melancholy
music
.
your
other
name
i
do
not
like
;
so
if
you
was
ever
wishing
to
hear
your
tune
again
you
are
to
ask
for
it
by
mine
.
"
this
was
said
with
a
significance
that
gave
my
heart
a
jog
.
"
why
that
,
miss
grant
?
"
i
asked
.
"
why
,
"
says
she
,
"
if
ever
you
should
come
to
get
hanged
,
i
will
set
your
last
dying
speech
and
confession
to
that
tune
and
sing
it
.
"
this
put
it
beyond
a
doubt
that
she
was
partly
informed
of
my
story
and
peril
.
how
,
or
just
how
much
,
it
was
more
difficult
to
guess
.
it
was
plain
she
knew
there
was
something
of
danger
in
the
name
of
alan
,
and
thus
warned
me
to
leave
it
out
of
reference
;
and
plain
she
knew
that
i
stood
under
some
criminal
suspicion
.
i
judged
besides
that
the
harshness
of
her
last
speech
(
which
besides
she
had
followed
up
immediately
with
a
very
noisy
piece
of
music
)
was
to
put
an
end
to
the
present
conversation
.
i
stood
beside
her
,
affecting
to
listen
and
admire
,
but
truly
whirled
away
by
my
own
thoughts
.
i
have
always
found
this
young
lady
to
be
a
lover
of
the
mysterious
;
and
certainly
this
first
interview
made
a
mystery
that
was
beyond
my
plummet
.
one
thing
i
learned
long
after
,
the
hours
of
the
sunday
had
been
well
employed
,
the
bank
porter
had
been
found
and
examined
,
my
visit
to
charles
stewart
was
discovered
,
and
the
deduction
made
that
i
was
pretty
deep
with
james
and
alan
,
and
most
likely
in
a
continued
correspondence
with
the
last
.
hence
this
broad
hint
that
was
given
me
across
the
harpsichord
.
in
the
midst
of
the
piece
of
music
,
one
of
the
younger
misses
,
who
was
at
a
window
over
the
close
,
cried
on
her
sisters
to
come
quick
,
for
there
was
"
grey
eyes
again
.
"
the
whole
family
trooped
there
at
once
,
and
crowded
one
another
for
a
look
.
the
window
whither
they
ran
was
in
an
odd
corner
of
that
room
,
gave
above
the
entrance
door
,
and
flanked
up
the
close
.
"
come
,
mr
balfour
,
"
they
cried
,
"
come
and
see
.
she
is
the
most
beautiful
creature
!
she
hangs
round
the
close
-
head
these
last
days
,
always
with
some
wretched
-
like
gillies
,
and
yet
seems
quite
a
lady
.
"
i
had
no
need
to
look
;
neither
did
i
look
twice
,
or
long
.
i
was
afraid
she
might
have
seen
me
there
,
looking
down
upon
her
from
that
chamber
of
music
,
and
she
without
,
and
her
father
in
the
same
house
,
perhaps
begging
for
his
life
with
tears
,
and
myself
come
but
newly
from
rejecting
his
petitions
.
but
even
that
glance
set
me
in
a
better
conceit
of
myself
and
much
less
awe
of
the
young
ladies
.
they
were
beautiful
,
that
was
beyond
question
,
but
catriona
was
beautiful
too
,
and
had
a
kind
of
brightness
in
her
like
a
coal
of
fire
.
as
much
as
the
others
cast
me
down
,
she
lifted
me
up
.
i
remembered
i
had
talked
easily
with
her
.
if
i
could
make
no
hand
of
it
with
these
fine
maids
,
it
was
perhaps
something
their
own
fault
.
my
embarrassment
began
to
be
a
little
mingled
and
lightened
with
a
sense
of
fun
;
and
when
the
aunt
smiled
at
me
from
her
embroidery
,
and
the
three
daughters
unbent
to
me
like
a
baby
,
all
with
"
papa
'
s
orders
"
written
on
their
faces
,
there
were
times
when
i
could
have
found
it
in
my
heart
to
smile
myself
.
presently
papa
returned
,
the
same
kind
,
happy
-
like
,
pleasant
-
spoken
man
.
"
now
,
girls
,
"
said
he
,
"
i
must
take
mr
balfour
away
again
;
but
i
hope
you
have
been
able
to
persuade
him
to
return
where
i
shall
be
always
gratified
to
find
him
.
"
so
they
each
made
me
a
little
farthing
compliment
,
and
i
was
led
away
.
if
this
visit
to
the
family
had
been
meant
to
soften
my
resistance
,
it
was
the
worst
of
failures
.
i
was
no
such
ass
but
what
i
understood
how
poor
a
figure
i
had
made
,
and
that
the
girls
would
be
yawning
their
jaws
off
as
soon
as
my
stiff
back
was
turned
.
i
felt
i
had
shown
how
little
i
had
in
me
of
what
was
soft
and
graceful
;
and
i
longed
for
a
chance
to
prove
that
i
had
something
of
the
other
stuff
,
the
stern
and
dangerous
.
well
,
i
was
to
be
served
to
my
desire
,
for
the
scene
to
which
he
was
conducting
me
was
of
a
different
character
.
there
was
a
man
waiting
us
in
prestongrange
'
s
study
,
whom
i
distasted
at
the
first
look
,
as
we
distaste
a
ferret
or
an
earwig
.
he
was
bitter
ugly
,
but
seemed
very
much
of
a
gentleman
;
had
still
manners
,
but
capable
of
sudden
leaps
and
violences
;
and
a
small
voice
,
which
could
ring
out
shrill
and
dangerous
when
he
so
desired
.
the
advocate
presented
us
in
a
familiar
,
friendly
way
.
"
here
,
fraser
,
"
said
he
,
"
here
is
mr
balfour
whom
we
talked
about
.
mr
david
,
this
is
mr
simon
fraser
,
whom
we
used
to
call
by
another
title
,
but
that
is
an
old
song
.
mr
fraser
has
an
errand
to
you
.
"
with
that
he
stepped
aside
to
his
book
-
shelves
,
and
made
believe
to
consult
a
quarto
volume
in
the
far
end
.
i
was
thus
left
(
in
a
sense
)
alone
with
perhaps
the
last
person
in
the
world
i
had
expected
.
there
was
no
doubt
upon
the
terms
of
introduction
;
this
could
be
no
other
than
the
forfeited
master
of
lovat
and
chief
of
the
great
clan
fraser
.
i
knew
he
had
led
his
men
in
the
rebellion
;
i
knew
his
father
'
s
head
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
my
old
lord
'
s
,
that
grey
fox
of
the
mountains
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
have
fallen
on
the
block
for
that
offence
,
the
lands
of
the
family
to
have
been
seized
,
and
their
nobility
attainted
.
i
could
not
conceive
what
he
should
be
doing
in
grant
'
s
house
;
i
could
not
conceive
that
he
had
been
called
to
the
bar
,
had
eaten
all
his
principles
,
and
was
now
currying
favour
with
the
government
even
to
the
extent
of
acting
advocate
-
depute
in
the
appin
murder
.
"
well
,
mr
balfour
,
"
said
he
,
"
what
is
all
this
i
hear
of
ye
?
"
"
it
would
not
become
me
to
prejudge
,
"
said
i
,
"
but
if
the
advocate
was
your
authority
he
is
fully
possessed
of
my
opinions
.
"
"
i
may
tell
you
i
am
engaged
in
the
appin
case
,
"
he
went
on
;
"
i
am
to
appear
under
prestongrange
;
and
from
my
study
of
the
precognitions
i
can
assure
you
your
opinions
are
erroneous
.
the
guilt
of
breck
is
manifest
;
and
your
testimony
,
in
which
you
admit
you
saw
him
on
the
hill
at
the
very
moment
,
will
certify
his
hanging
.
"
"
it
will
be
rather
ill
to
hang
him
till
you
catch
him
,
"
i
observed
.
"
and
for
other
matters
i
very
willingly
leave
you
to
your
own
impressions
.
"
"
the
duke
has
been
informed
,
"
he
went
on
.
"
i
have
just
come
from
his
grace
,
and
he
expressed
himself
before
me
with
an
honest
freedom
like
the
great
nobleman
he
is
.
he
spoke
of
you
by
name
,
mr
balfour
,
and
declared
his
gratitude
beforehand
in
case
you
would
be
led
by
those
who
understand
your
own
interests
and
those
of
the
country
so
much
better
than
yourself
.
gratitude
is
no
empty
expression
in
that
mouth
:
experto
-
crede
.
i
daresay
you
know
something
of
my
name
and
clan
,
and
the
damnable
example
and
lamented
end
of
my
late
father
,
to
say
nothing
of
my
own
errata
.
well
,
i
have
made
my
peace
with
that
good
duke
;
he
has
intervened
for
me
with
our
friend
prestongrange
;
and
here
i
am
with
my
foot
in
the
stirrup
again
and
some
of
the
responsibility
shared
into
my
hand
of
prosecuting
king
george
'
s
enemies
and
avenging
the
late
daring
and
barefaced
insult
to
his
majesty
.
"
"
doubtless
a
proud
position
for
your
father
'
s
son
,
"
says
i
.
he
wagged
his
bald
eyebrows
at
me
.
"
you
are
pleased
to
make
experiments
in
the
ironical
,
i
think
,
"
said
he
.
"
but
i
am
here
upon
duty
,
i
am
here
to
discharge
my
errand
in
good
faith
,
it
is
in
vain
you
think
to
divert
me
.
and
let
me
tell
you
,
for
a
young
fellow
of
spirit
and
ambition
like
yourself
,
a
good
shove
in
the
beginning
will
do
more
than
ten
years
'
drudgery
.
the
shove
is
now
at
your
command
;
choose
what
you
will
to
be
advanced
in
,
the
duke
will
watch
upon
you
with
the
affectionate
disposition
of
a
father
.
"
"
i
am
thinking
that
i
lack
the
docility
of
the
son
,
"
says
i
.
"
and
do
you
really
suppose
,
sir
,
that
the
whole
policy
of
this
country
is
to
be
suffered
to
trip
up
and
tumble
down
for
an
ill
-
mannered
colt
of
a
boy
?
"
he
cried
.
"
this
has
been
made
a
test
case
,
all
who
would
prosper
in
the
future
must
put
a
shoulder
to
the
wheel
.
look
at
me
!
do
you
suppose
it
is
for
my
pleasure
that
i
put
myself
in
the
highly
invidious
position
of
persecuting
a
man
that
i
have
drawn
the
sword
alongside
of
?
the
choice
is
not
left
me
.
"
"
but
i
think
,
sir
,
that
you
forfeited
your
choice
when
you
mixed
in
with
that
unnatural
rebellion
,
"
i
remarked
.
"
my
case
is
happily
otherwise
;
i
am
a
true
man
,
and
can
look
either
the
duke
or
king
george
in
the
face
without
concern
.
"
"
is
it
so
the
wind
sits
?
"
says
he
.
"
i
protest
you
are
fallen
in
the
worst
sort
of
error
.
prestongrange
has
been
hitherto
so
civil
(
he
tells
me
)
as
not
to
combat
your
allegations
;
but
you
must
not
think
they
are
not
looked
upon
with
strong
suspicion
.
you
say
you
are
innocent
.
my
dear
sir
,
the
facts
declare
you
guilty
.
"
"
i
was
waiting
for
you
there
,
"
said
i
.
"
the
evidence
of
mungo
campbell
;
your
flight
after
the
completion
of
the
murder
;
your
long
course
of
secresy
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
my
good
young
man
!
"
said
mr
simon
,
"
here
is
enough
evidence
to
hang
a
bullock
,
let
be
a
david
balfour
!
i
shall
be
upon
that
trial
;
my
voice
shall
be
raised
;
i
shall
then
speak
much
otherwise
from
what
i
do
to
-
day
,
and
far
less
to
your
gratification
,
little
as
you
like
it
now
!
ah
,
you
look
white
!
"
cries
he
.
"
i
have
found
the
key
of
your
impudent
heart
.
you
look
pale
,
your
eyes
waver
,
mr
david
!
you
see
the
grave
and
the
gallows
nearer
by
than
you
had
fancied
.
"
"
i
own
to
a
natural
weakness
,
"
said
i
.
"
i
think
no
shame
for
that
.
shame
.
.
.
"
i
was
going
on
.
"
shame
waits
for
you
on
the
gibbet
,
"
he
broke
in
.
"
where
i
shall
but
be
even
'
d
with
my
lord
your
father
,
"
said
i
.
"
aha
,
but
not
so
!
"
he
cried
,
"
and
you
do
not
yet
see
to
the
bottom
of
this
business
.
my
father
suffered
in
a
great
cause
,
and
for
dealing
in
the
affairs
of
kings
.
you
are
to
hang
for
a
dirty
murder
about
boddle
-
pieces
.
your
personal
part
in
it
,
the
treacherous
one
of
holding
the
poor
wretch
in
talk
,
your
accomplices
a
pack
of
ragged
highland
gillies
.
and
it
can
be
shown
,
my
great
mr
balfour
,
it
can
be
shown
,
and
it
will
be
shown
,
trust
me
that
has
a
finger
in
the
pie
,
it
can
be
shown
,
and
shall
be
shown
,
that
you
were
paid
to
do
it
.
i
think
i
can
see
the
looks
go
round
the
court
when
i
adduce
my
evidence
,
and
it
shall
appear
that
you
,
a
young
man
of
education
,
let
yourself
be
corrupted
to
this
shocking
act
for
a
suit
of
cast
clothes
,
a
bottle
of
highland
spirits
,
and
three
-
and
-
fivepence
-
halfpenny
in
copper
money
.
"
there
was
a
touch
of
the
truth
in
these
words
that
knocked
me
like
a
blow
:
clothes
,
a
bottle
of
usquebaugh
,
and
three
-
and
-
fivepence
-
halfpenny
in
change
made
up
,
indeed
,
the
most
of
what
alan
and
i
had
carried
from
auchurn
;
and
i
saw
that
some
of
james
'
s
people
had
been
blabbing
in
their
dungeons
.
"
you
see
i
know
more
than
you
fancied
,
"
he
resumed
in
triumph
.
"
and
as
for
giving
it
this
turn
,
great
mr
david
,
you
must
not
suppose
the
government
of
great
britain
and
ireland
will
ever
be
stuck
for
want
of
evidence
.
we
have
men
here
in
prison
who
will
swear
out
their
lives
as
we
direct
them
;
as
i
direct
,
if
you
prefer
the
phrase
.
so
now
you
are
to
guess
your
part
of
glory
if
you
choose
to
die
.
on
the
one
hand
,
life
,
wine
,
women
,
and
a
duke
to
be
your
handgun
:
on
the
other
,
a
rope
to
your
craig
,
and
a
gibbet
to
clatter
your
bones
on
,
and
the
lousiest
,
lowest
story
to
hand
down
to
your
namesakes
in
the
future
that
was
ever
told
about
a
hired
assassin
.
and
see
here
!
"
he
cried
,
with
a
formidable
shrill
voice
,
"
see
this
paper
that
i
pull
out
of
my
pocket
.
look
at
the
name
there
:
it
is
the
name
of
the
great
david
,
i
believe
,
the
ink
scarce
dry
yet
.
can
you
guess
its
nature
?
it
is
the
warrant
for
your
arrest
,
which
i
have
but
to
touch
this
bell
beside
me
to
have
executed
on
the
spot
.
once
in
the
tolbooth
upon
this
paper
,
may
god
help
you
,
for
the
die
is
cast
!
"
i
must
never
deny
that
i
was
greatly
horrified
by
so
much
baseness
,
and
much
unmanned
by
the
immediacy
and
ugliness
of
my
danger
.
mr
simon
had
already
gloried
in
the
changes
of
my
hue
;
i
make
no
doubt
i
was
now
no
ruddier
than
my
shirt
;
my
speech
besides
trembled
.
"
there
is
a
gentleman
in
this
room
,
"
cried
i
.
"
i
appeal
to
him
.
i
put
my
life
and
credit
in
his
hands
.
"
prestongrange
shut
his
book
with
a
snap
.
"
i
told
you
so
,
simon
,
"
said
he
;
"
you
have
played
your
hand
for
all
it
was
worth
,
and
you
have
lost
.
mr
david
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
i
wish
you
to
believe
it
was
by
no
choice
of
mine
you
were
subjected
to
this
proof
.
i
wish
you
could
understand
how
glad
i
am
you
should
come
forth
from
it
with
so
much
credit
.
you
may
not
quite
see
how
,
but
it
is
a
little
of
a
service
to
myself
.
for
had
our
friend
here
been
more
successful
than
i
was
last
night
,
it
might
have
appeared
that
he
was
a
better
judge
of
men
than
i
;
it
might
have
appeared
we
were
altogether
in
the
wrong
situations
,
mr
simon
and
myself
.
and
i
know
our
friend
simon
to
be
ambitious
,
"
says
he
,
striking
lightly
on
fraser
'
s
shoulder
.
"
as
for
this
stage
play
,
it
is
over
;
my
sentiments
are
very
much
engaged
in
your
behalf
;
and
whatever
issue
we
can
find
to
this
unfortunate
affair
,
i
shall
make
it
my
business
to
see
it
is
adopted
with
tenderness
to
you
.
"
these
were
very
good
words
,
and
i
could
see
besides
that
there
was
little
love
,
and
perhaps
a
spice
of
genuine
ill
-
will
,
between
these
two
who
were
opposed
to
me
.
for
all
that
,
it
was
unmistakable
this
interview
had
been
designed
,
perhaps
rehearsed
,
with
the
consent
of
both
;
it
was
plain
my
adversaries
were
in
earnest
to
try
me
by
all
methods
;
and
now
(
persuasion
,
flattery
,
and
menaces
having
been
tried
in
vain
)
i
could
not
but
wonder
what
would
be
their
next
expedient
.
my
eyes
besides
were
still
troubled
,
and
my
knees
loose
under
me
,
with
the
distress
of
the
late
ordeal
;
and
i
could
do
no
more
than
stammer
the
same
form
of
words
:
"
i
put
my
life
and
credit
in
your
hands
.
"
"
well
,
well
,
"
said
he
,
"
we
must
try
to
save
them
.
and
in
the
meanwhile
let
us
return
to
gentler
methods
.
you
must
not
bear
any
grudge
upon
my
friend
,
mr
simon
,
who
did
but
speak
by
his
brief
.
and
even
if
you
did
conceive
some
malice
against
myself
,
who
stood
by
and
seemed
rather
to
hold
a
candle
,
i
must
not
let
that
extend
to
innocent
members
of
my
family
.
these
are
greatly
engaged
to
see
more
of
you
,
and
i
cannot
consent
to
have
my
young
womenfolk
disappointed
.
to
-
morrow
they
will
be
going
to
hope
park
,
where
i
think
it
very
proper
you
should
make
your
bow
.
call
for
me
first
,
when
i
may
possibly
have
something
for
your
private
hearing
;
then
you
shall
be
turned
abroad
again
under
the
conduct
of
my
misses
;
and
until
that
time
repeat
to
me
your
promise
of
secrecy
.
"
i
had
done
better
to
have
instantly
refused
,
but
in
truth
i
was
beside
the
power
of
reasoning
;
did
as
i
was
bid
;
took
my
leave
i
know
not
how
;
and
when
i
was
forth
again
in
the
close
,
and
the
door
had
shut
behind
me
,
was
glad
to
lean
on
a
house
wall
and
wipe
my
face
.
that
horrid
apparition
(
as
i
may
call
it
)
of
mr
simon
rang
in
my
memory
,
as
a
sudden
noise
rings
after
it
is
over
in
the
ear
.
tales
of
the
man
'
s
father
,
of
his
falseness
,
of
his
manifold
perpetual
treacheries
,
rose
before
me
from
all
that
i
had
heard
and
read
,
and
joined
on
with
what
i
had
just
experienced
of
himself
.
each
time
it
occurred
to
me
,
the
ingenious
foulness
of
that
calumny
he
had
proposed
to
nail
upon
my
character
startled
me
afresh
.
the
case
of
the
man
upon
the
gibbet
by
leith
walk
appeared
scarce
distinguishable
from
that
i
was
now
to
consider
as
my
own
.
to
rob
a
child
of
so
little
more
than
nothing
was
certainly
a
paltry
enterprise
for
two
grown
men
;
but
my
own
tale
,
as
it
was
to
be
represented
in
a
court
by
simon
fraser
,
appeared
a
fair
second
in
every
possible
point
of
view
of
sordidness
and
cowardice
.
the
voices
of
two
of
prestongrange
'
s
liveried
men
upon
his
doorstep
recalled
me
to
myself
.
"
ha
'
e
,
"
said
the
one
,
"
this
billet
as
fast
as
ye
can
link
to
the
captain
.
"
"
is
that
for
the
cateran
back
again
?
"
asked
the
other
.
"
it
would
seem
sae
,
"
returned
the
first
.
"
him
and
simon
are
seeking
him
.
"
"
i
think
prestongrange
is
gane
gyte
,
"
says
the
second
.
"
he
will
have
james
more
in
bed
with
him
next
.
"
"
weel
,
it
is
neither
your
affair
nor
mine
'
s
,
"
said
the
first
.
and
they
parted
,
the
one
upon
his
errand
,
and
the
other
back
into
the
house
.
this
looked
as
ill
as
possible
.
i
was
scarce
gone
and
they
were
sending
already
for
james
more
,
to
whom
i
thought
mr
simon
must
have
pointed
when
he
spoke
of
men
in
prison
and
ready
to
redeem
their
lives
by
all
extremities
.
my
scalp
curdled
among
my
hair
,
and
the
next
moment
the
blood
leaped
in
me
to
remember
catriona
.
poor
lass
!
her
father
stood
to
be
hanged
for
pretty
indefensible
misconduct
.
what
was
yet
more
unpalatable
,
it
now
seemed
he
was
prepared
to
save
his
four
quarters
by
the
worst
of
shame
and
the
most
foul
of
cowardly
murders
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
murder
by
the
false
oath
;
and
to
complete
our
misfortunes
,
it
seemed
myself
was
picked
out
to
be
the
victim
.
i
began
to
walk
swiftly
and
at
random
,
conscious
only
of
a
desire
for
movement
,
air
,
and
the
open
country
.
i
came
forth
,
i
vow
i
know
not
how
,
on
the
lang
dykes
.
this
is
a
rural
road
which
runs
on
the
north
side
over
against
the
city
.
thence
i
could
see
the
whole
black
length
of
it
tail
down
,
from
where
the
castle
stands
upon
its
crags
above
the
loch
in
a
long
line
of
spires
and
gable
ends
,
and
smoking
chimneys
,
and
at
the
sight
my
heart
swelled
in
my
bosom
.
my
youth
,
as
i
have
told
,
was
already
inured
to
dangers
;
but
such
danger
as
i
had
seen
the
face
of
but
that
morning
,
in
the
midst
of
what
they
call
the
safety
of
a
town
,
shook
me
beyond
experience
.
peril
of
slavery
,
peril
of
shipwreck
,
peril
of
sword
and
shot
,
i
had
stood
all
of
these
without
discredit
;
but
the
peril
there
was
in
the
sharp
voice
and
the
fat
face
of
simon
,
property
lord
lovat
,
daunted
me
wholly
.
i
sat
by
the
lake
side
in
a
place
where
the
rushes
went
down
into
the
water
,
and
there
steeped
my
wrists
and
laved
my
temples
.
if
i
could
have
done
so
with
any
remains
of
self
-
esteem
,
i
would
now
have
fled
from
my
foolhardy
enterprise
.
but
(
call
it
courage
or
cowardice
,
and
i
believe
it
was
both
the
one
and
the
other
)
i
decided
i
was
ventured
out
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
retreat
.
i
had
out
-
faced
these
men
,
i
would
continue
to
out
-
face
them
;
come
what
might
,
i
would
stand
by
the
word
spoken
.
the
sense
of
my
own
constancy
somewhat
uplifted
my
spirits
,
but
not
much
.
at
the
best
of
it
there
was
an
icy
place
about
my
heart
,
and
life
seemed
a
black
business
to
be
at
all
engaged
in
.
for
two
souls
in
particular
my
pity
flowed
.
the
one
was
myself
,
to
be
so
friendless
and
lost
among
dangers
.
the
other
was
the
girl
,
the
daughter
of
james
more
.
i
had
seen
but
little
of
her
;
yet
my
view
was
taken
and
my
judgment
made
.
i
thought
her
a
lass
of
a
clean
honour
,
like
a
man
'
s
;
i
thought
her
one
to
die
of
a
disgrace
;
and
now
i
believed
her
father
to
be
at
that
moment
bargaining
his
vile
life
for
mine
.
it
made
a
bond
in
my
thoughts
betwixt
the
girl
and
me
.
i
had
seen
her
before
only
as
a
wayside
appearance
,
though
one
that
pleased
me
strangely
;
i
saw
her
now
in
a
sudden
nearness
of
relation
,
as
the
daughter
of
my
blood
foe
,
and
i
might
say
,
my
murderer
.
i
reflected
it
was
hard
i
should
be
so
plagued
and
persecuted
all
my
days
for
other
folks
'
affairs
,
and
have
no
manner
of
pleasure
myself
.
i
got
meals
and
a
bed
to
sleep
in
when
my
concerns
would
suffer
it
;
beyond
that
my
wealth
was
of
no
help
to
me
.
if
i
was
to
hang
,
my
days
were
like
to
be
short
;
if
i
was
not
to
hang
but
to
escape
out
of
this
trouble
,
they
might
yet
seem
long
to
me
ere
i
was
done
with
them
.
of
a
sudden
her
face
appeared
in
my
memory
,
the
way
i
had
first
seen
it
,
with
the
parted
lips
;
at
that
,
weakness
came
in
my
bosom
and
strength
into
my
legs
;
and
i
set
resolutely
forward
on
the
way
to
dean
.
if
i
was
to
hang
to
-
morrow
,
and
it
was
sure
enough
i
might
very
likely
sleep
that
night
in
a
dungeon
,
i
determined
i
should
hear
and
speak
once
more
with
catriona
.
the
exercise
of
walking
and
the
thought
of
my
destination
braced
me
yet
more
,
so
that
i
began
to
pluck
up
a
kind
of
spirit
.
in
the
village
of
dean
,
where
it
sits
in
the
bottom
of
a
glen
beside
the
river
,
i
inquired
my
way
of
a
miller
'
s
man
,
who
sent
me
up
the
hill
upon
the
farther
side
by
a
plain
path
,
and
so
to
a
decent
-
like
small
house
in
a
garden
of
lawns
and
apple
-
trees
.
my
heart
beat
high
as
i
stepped
inside
the
garden
hedge
,
but
it
fell
low
indeed
when
i
came
face
to
face
with
a
grim
and
fierce
old
lady
,
walking
there
in
a
white
mutch
with
a
man
'
s
hat
strapped
upon
the
top
of
it
.
"
what
do
ye
come
seeking
here
?
"
she
asked
.
i
told
her
i
was
after
miss
drummond
.
"
and
what
may
be
your
business
with
miss
drummond
?
"
says
she
.
i
told
her
i
had
met
her
on
saturday
last
,
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
render
her
a
trifling
service
,
and
was
come
now
on
the
young
lady
'
s
invitation
.
"
o
,
so
you
are
saxpence
!
"
she
cried
,
with
a
very
sneering
manner
.
"
a
braw
gift
,
a
bonny
gentleman
.
and
hae
ye
ony
ither
name
and
designation
,
or
were
ye
bapteesed
saxpence
?
"
she
asked
.
i
told
my
name
.
"
preserve
me
!
"
she
cried
.
"
has
ebenezer
gotten
a
son
?
"
"
no
,
ma
'
am
,
"
said
i
.
"
i
am
a
son
of
alexander
'
s
.
it
is
i
that
am
the
laird
of
shaws
.
"
"
ye
will
find
your
work
cut
out
for
ye
to
establish
that
,
"
quoth
she
.
"
i
perceive
you
know
my
uncle
,
"
said
i
;
"
and
i
daresay
you
may
be
the
better
pleased
to
hear
that
business
is
arranged
.
"
"
and
what
brings
ye
here
after
miss
drummond
?
"
she
pursued
.
"
i
am
come
after
my
saxpence
,
mem
,
"
said
i
.
"
it
is
to
be
thought
,
being
my
uncle
'
s
nephew
,
i
would
be
found
a
careful
lad
.
"
"
so
ye
have
a
spark
of
sleeness
in
ye
?
"
observed
the
old
lady
,
with
some
approval
.
"
i
thought
ye
had
just
been
a
cuif
,
you
and
your
saxpence
,
and
your
lucky
day
and
your
sake
of
balwhidder
,
from
which
i
was
gratified
to
learn
that
catriona
had
not
forgotten
some
of
our
talk
.
"
but
all
this
is
by
the
purpose
,
"
she
resumed
.
"
am
i
to
understand
that
ye
come
here
keeping
company
?
"
"
this
is
surely
rather
an
early
question
,
"
said
i
.
"
the
maid
is
young
,
so
am
i
,
worse
fortune
.
i
have
but
seen
her
the
once
.
i
will
not
deny
,
"
i
added
,
making
up
my
mind
to
try
her
with
some
frankness
,
"
i
will
not
deny
but
she
has
run
in
my
head
a
good
deal
since
i
met
in
with
her
.
that
is
one
thing
;
but
it
would
be
quite
another
,
and
i
think
i
would
look
very
like
a
fool
,
to
commit
myself
.
"
"
you
can
speak
out
of
your
mouth
,
i
see
,
"
said
the
old
lady
.
"
praise
god
,
and
so
can
i
!
i
was
fool
enough
to
take
charge
of
this
rogue
'
s
daughter
:
a
fine
charge
i
have
gotten
;
but
it
is
mine
,
and
i
will
carry
it
the
way
i
want
to
.
do
ye
mean
to
tell
me
,
mr
balfour
of
shaws
,
that
you
would
marry
james
more
'
s
daughter
,
and
him
hanged
!
well
,
then
,
where
there
'
s
no
possible
marriage
there
shall
be
no
manner
of
carryings
on
,
and
take
that
for
said
.
lasses
are
bruckle
things
,
"
she
added
,
with
a
nod
;
"
and
though
ye
would
never
think
it
by
my
wrunkled
chafts
,
i
was
a
lassie
mysel
'
,
and
a
bonny
one
.
"
"
lady
allardyce
,
"
said
i
,
"
for
that
i
suppose
to
be
your
name
,
you
seem
to
do
the
two
sides
of
the
talking
,
which
is
a
very
poor
manner
to
come
to
an
agreement
.
you
give
me
rather
a
home
thrust
when
you
ask
if
i
would
marry
,
at
the
gallow
'
s
foot
,
a
young
lady
whom
i
have
seen
but
once
.
i
have
told
you
already
i
would
never
be
so
untenty
as
to
commit
myself
.
and
yet
i
will
go
some
way
with
you
.
if
i
continue
to
like
the
lass
as
well
as
i
have
reason
to
expect
,
it
will
be
something
more
than
her
father
,
or
the
gallows
either
,
that
keeps
the
two
of
us
apart
.
as
for
my
family
,
i
found
it
by
the
wayside
like
a
lost
bawbee
!
i
owe
less
than
nothing
to
my
uncle
and
if
ever
i
marry
,
it
will
be
to
please
one
person
:
that
'
s
myself
.
"
"
i
have
heard
this
kind
of
talk
before
ye
were
born
,
"
said
mrs
ogilvy
,
"
which
is
perhaps
the
reason
that
i
think
of
it
so
little
.
there
'
s
much
to
be
considered

this
james

a
kinsman
of

shame

the
better

if

was
just
the
hanging

for
my
part
i

i

be
best
pleased

james

would
be
at

an
end

him

of

there

the

daft

with
her

i
interrupted
.

i
saw
her
again
this
morning
from

window
at

i

put
in

return

of

cries
the
old
lady
,
with
a
sudden
pucker
of
her
face

i
think
it
was
at
the
advocate

i
told
her
that
was
so

she
said
;

then
suddenly
,
upon
rather
a
scolding
tone
,
"
i
have
your
bare
word
for
it

she
cries
,
"
as
to

and
to
have

fairly

much

,
suiting
the
action
to
the
word

a
braw
journey
to
ye
back
to
where
ye
cam
frae

"
"
if
you
think
me
a
spy
,
"
i
broke
out
,
and
speech
stuck
in
my
throat
.
i
stood
and
looked
murder
at
the
old
lady
for
a
space
,
then
bowed
and
turned
away
.
"
here
!
hoots
!
the
callant
'
s
in
a
creel
!
"
she
cried
.
"
think
ye
a
spy
?
what
else
would
i
think
ye
me
that
kens
naething
by
ye
?
but
i
see
that
i
was
wrong
;
and
as
i
cannot
fight
,
i
will
have
to
apologise
.
a
bonny
figure
i
would
be
with
a
broadsword
.
ay
!
ay
!
"
she
went
on
,
"
you
are
none
such
a
bad
lad
in
your
way
;
i
think
ye
will
have
some
redeeming
vices
.
but
,
o
!
davit
balfour
,
ye
are
damned
countryfeed
.
ye
will
have
to
win
over
that
,
lad
;
ye
will
have
to
soople
your
back
-
bone
,
and
think
a
wee
pickle
less
of
your
dainty
self
;
and
ye
will
have
to
try
to
find
out
that
women
-
folk
are
nae
grenadiers
.
but
that
can
never
be
.
to
your
last
day
you
will
ken
no
more
of
women
-
folk
than
what
i
do
of
sow
-
gelding
.
"
i
had
never
been
used
with
such
expressions
from
a
lady
'
s
tongue
,
the
only
two
ladies
i
had
known
,
mrs
campbell
and
my
mother
,
being
most
devout
and
most
particular
women
;
and
i
suppose
my
amazement
must
have
been
depicted
in
my
countenance
,
for
mrs
ogilvy
burst
forth
suddenly
in
a
fit
of
laughter
.
"
keep
me
!
"
she
cried
,
struggling
with
her
mirth
,
"
you
have
the
finest
timber
face
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
you
to
marry
the
daughter
of
a
hieland
cateran
!
davie
,
my
dear
,
i
think
we
will
have
to
make
a
match
of
it
if
it
was
just
to
see
the
weans
.
and
now
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
there
'
s
no
manner
of
service
in
your
daidling
here
,
for
the
young
woman
is
from
home
,
and
it
is
my
fear
that
the
old
woman
is
no
suitable
companion
for
your
father
'
s
son
.
forbye
that
i
have
nobody
but
myself
to
look
after
my
reputation
,
and
have
been
long
enough
alone
with
a
sedooctive
youth
.
and
come
back
another
day
for
your
saxpence
!
"
she
cried
after
me
as
i
left
.
my
skirmish
with
this
disconcerting
lady
gave
my
thoughts
a
boldness
they
had
otherwise
wanted
.
for
two
days
the
image
of
catriona
had
mixed
in
all
my
meditations
;
she
made
their
background
,
so
that
i
scarce
enjoyed
my
own
company
without
a
glint
of
her
in
a
corner
of
my
mind
.
but
now
she
came
immediately
near
;
i
seemed
to
touch
her
,
whom
i
had
never
touched
but
the
once
;
i
let
myself
flow
out
to
her
in
a
happy
weakness
,
and
looking
all
about
,
and
before
and
behind
,
saw
the
world
like
an
undesirable
desert
,
where
men
go
as
soldiers
on
a
march
,
following
their
duty
with
what
constancy
they
have
,
and
catriona
alone
there
to
offer
me
some
pleasure
of
my
days
.
i
wondered
at
myself
that
i
could
dwell
on
such
considerations
in
that
time
of
my
peril
and
disgrace
;
and
when
i
remembered
my
youth
i
was
ashamed
.
i
had
my
studies
to
complete
:
i
had
to
be
called
into
some
useful
business
;
i
had
yet
to
take
my
part
of
service
in
a
place
where
all
must
serve
;
i
had
yet
to
learn
,
and
know
,
and
prove
myself
a
man
;
and
i
had
so
much
sense
as
blush
that
i
should
be
already
tempted
with
these
further
-
on
and
holier
delights
and
duties
.
my
education
spoke
home
to
me
sharply
;
i
was
never
brought
up
on
sugar
biscuits
but
on
the
hard
food
of
the
truth
.
i
knew
that
he
was
quite
unfit
to
be
a
husband
who
was
not
prepared
to
be
a
father
also
;
and
for
a
boy
like
me
to
play
the
father
was
a
mere
derision
.
when
i
was
in
the
midst
of
these
thoughts
and
about
half
-
way
back
to
town
i
saw
a
figure
coming
to
meet
me
,
and
the
trouble
of
my
heart
was
heightened
.
it
seemed
i
had
everything
in
the
world
to
say
to
her
,
but
nothing
to
say
first
;
and
remembering
how
tongue
-
tied
i
had
been
that
morning
at
the
advocate
'
s
i
made
sure
that
i
would
find
myself
struck
dumb
.
but
when
she
came
up
my
fears
fled
away
;
not
even
the
consciousness
of
what
i
had
been
privately
thinking
disconcerted
me
the
least
;
and
i
found
i
could
talk
with
her
as
easily
and
rationally
as
i
might
with
alan
.
"
o
!
"
she
cried
,
"
you
have
been
seeking
your
sixpence
;
did
you
get
it
?
"
i
told
her
no
;
but
now
i
had
met
with
her
my
walk
was
not
in
vain
.
"
though
i
have
seen
you
to
-
day
already
,
"
said
i
,
and
told
her
where
and
when
.
"
i
did
not
see
you
,
"
she
said
.
"
my
eyes
are
big
,
but
there
are
better
than
mine
at
seeing
far
.
only
i
heard
singing
in
the
house
.
"
"
that
was
miss
grant
,
"
said
i
,
"
the
eldest
and
the
bonniest
.
"
"
they
say
they
are
all
beautiful
,
"
said
she
.
"
they
think
the
same
of
you
,
miss
drummond
,
"
i
replied
,
"
and
were
all
crowding
to
the
window
to
observe
you
.
"
"
it
is
a
pity
about
my
being
so
blind
,
"
said
she
,
"
or
i
might
have
seen
them
too
.
and
you
were
in
the
house
?
you
must
have
been
having
the
fine
time
with
the
fine
music
and
the
pretty
ladies
.
"
"
there
is
just
where
you
are
wrong
,
"
said
i
;
"
for
i
was
as
uncouth
as
a
sea
-
fish
upon
the
brae
of
a
mountain
.
the
truth
is
that
i
am
better
fitted
to
go
about
with
rudas
men
than
pretty
ladies
.
"
"
well
,
i
would
think
so
too
,
at
all
events
!
"
said
she
,
at
which
we
both
of
us
laughed
.
"
it
is
a
strange
thing
,
now
,
"
said
i
.
"
i
am
not
the
least
afraid
with
you
,
yet
i
could
have
run
from
the
miss
grants
.
and
i
was
afraid
of
your
cousin
too
.
"
"
o
,
i
think
any
man
will
be
afraid
of
her
,
"
she
cried
.
"
my
father
is
afraid
of
her
himself
.
"
the
name
of
her
father
brought
me
to
a
stop
.
i
looked
at
her
as
she
walked
by
my
side
;
i
recalled
the
man
,
and
the
little
i
knew
and
the
much
i
guessed
of
him
;
and
comparing
the
one
with
the
other
,
felt
like
a
traitor
to
be
silent
.
"
speaking
of
which
,
"
said
i
,
"
i
met
your
father
no
later
than
this
morning
.
"
"
did
you
?
"
she
cried
,
with
a
voice
of
joy
that
seemed
to
mock
at
me
.
"
you
saw
james
more
?
you
will
have
spoken
with
him
then
?
"
"
i
did
even
that
,
"
said
i
.
then
i
think
things
went
the
worst
way
for
me
that
was
humanly
possible
.
she
gave
me
a
look
of
mere
gratitude
.
"
ah
,
thank
you
for
that
!
"
says
she
.
"
you
thank
me
for
very
little
,
"
said
i
,
and
then
stopped
.
but
it
seemed
when
i
was
holding
back
so
much
,
something
at
least
had
to
come
out
.
"
i
spoke
rather
ill
to
him
,
"
said
i
;
"
i
did
no
like
him
very
much
;
i
spoke
him
rather
ill
,
and
he
was
angry
.
"
"
i
think
you
had
little
to
do
then
,
and
less
to
tell
it
to
his
daughter
!
"
she
cried
out
.
"
but
those
that
do
not
love
and
cherish
him
i
will
not
know
.
"
"
i
will
take
the
freedom
of
a
word
yet
,
"
said
i
,
beginning
to
tremble
.
"
perhaps
neither
your
father
nor
i
are
in
the
best
of
spirits
at
prestongrange
'
s
.
i
daresay
we
both
have
anxious
business
there
,
for
it
is
a
dangerous
house
.
i
was
sorry
for
him
too
,
and
spoke
to
him
the
first
,
if
i
could
but
have
spoken
the
wiser
.
and
for
one
thing
,
in
my
opinion
,
you
will
soon
find
that
his
affairs
are
mending
.
"
"
it
will
not
be
through
your
friendship
,
i
am
thinking
,
"
said
she
;
"
and
he
is
much
made
up
to
you
for
your
sorrow
.
"
"
miss
drummond
,
"
cried
i
,
"
i
am
alone
in
this
world
.
"
"
and
i
am
not
wondering
at
that
,
"
said
she
.
"
o
,
let
me
speak
!
"
said
i
.
"
i
will
speak
but
the
once
,
and
then
leave
you
,
if
you
will
,
for
ever
.
i
came
this
day
in
the
hopes
of
a
kind
word
that
i
am
sore
in
want
of
.
i
know
that
what
i
said
must
hurt
you
,
and
i
knew
it
then
.
it
would
have
been
easy
to
have
spoken
smooth
,
easy
to
lie
to
you
;
can
you
not
think
how
i
was
tempted
to
the
same
?
cannot
you
see
the
truth
of
my
heart
shine
out
?
"
"
i
think
here
is
a
great
deal
of
work
,
mr
balfour
,
"
said
she
.
"
i
think
we
will
have
met
but
the
once
,
and
will
can
part
like
gentle
folk
.
"
"
o
,
let
me
have
one
to
believe
in
me
!
"
i
pleaded
,
"
i
cannae
bear
it
else
.
the
whole
world
is
clanned
against
me
.
how
am
i
to
go
through
with
my
dreadful
fate
?
if
there
'
s
to
be
none
to
believe
in
me
i
cannot
do
it
.
the
man
must
just
die
,
for
i
cannot
do
it
.
"
she
had
still
looked
straight
in
front
of
her
,
head
in
air
;
but
at
my
words
or
the
tone
of
my
voice
she
came
to
a
stop
.
"
what
is
this
you
say
?
"
she
asked
.
"
what
are
you
talking
of
?
"
"
it
is
my
testimony
which
may
save
an
innocent
life
,
"
said
i
,
"
and
they
will
not
suffer
me
to
bear
it
.
what
would
you
do
yourself
?
you
know
what
this
is
,
whose
father
lies
in
danger
.
would
you
desert
the
poor
soul
?
they
have
tried
all
ways
with
me
.
they
have
sought
to
bribe
me
;
they
offered
me
hills
and
valleys
.
and
to
-
day
that
sleuth
-
hound
told
me
how
i
stood
,
and
to
what
a
length
he
would
go
to
butcher
and
disgrace
me
.
i
am
to
be
brought
in
a
party
to
the
murder
;
i
am
to
have
held
glenure
in
talk
for
money
and
old
clothes
;
i
am
to
be
killed
and
shamed
.
if
this
is
the
way
i
am
to
fall
,
and
me
scarce
a
man
if
this
is
the
story
to
be
told
of
me
in
all
scotland
if
you
are
to
believe
it
too
,
and
my
name
is
to
be
nothing
but
a
by
-
word
catriona
,
how
can
i
go
through
with
it
?
the
thing
'
s
not
possible
;
it
is
more
than
a
man
has
in
his
heart
.
"
i
poured
my
words
out
in
a
whirl
,
one
upon
the
other
;
and
when
i
stopped
i
found
her
gazing
on
me
with
a
startled
face
.
"
glenure
!
it
is
the
appin
murder
,
"
she
said
softly
,
but
with
a
very
deep
surprise
.
i
had
turned
back
to
bear
her
company
,
and
we
were
now
come
near
the
head
of
the
brae
above
dean
village
.
at
this
word
i
stepped
in
front
of
her
like
one
suddenly
distracted
.
"
for
god
'
s
sake
!
"
i
cried
,
"
for
god
'
s
sake
,
what
is
this
that
i
have
done
?
"
and
carried
my
fists
to
my
temples
.
"
what
made
me
do
it
?
sure
,
i
am
bewitched
to
say
these
things
!
"
"
in
the
name
of
heaven
,
what
ails
you
now
!
"
she
cried
.
"
i
gave
my
honour
,
"
i
groaned
,
"
i
gave
my
honour
and
now
i
have
broke
it
.
o
,
catriona
!
"
"
i
am
asking
you
what
it
is
,
"
she
said
;
"
was
it
these
things
you
should
not
have
spoken
?
and
do
you
think
i
have
no
honour
,
then
?
or
that
i
am
one
that
would
betray
a
friend
?
i
hold
up
my
right
hand
to
you
and
swear
.
"
"
o
,
i
knew
you
would
be
true
!
"
said
i
.
"
it
is
me
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
it
is
here
.
i
that
stood
but
this
morning
and
out
-
faced
them
,
that
risked
rather
to
die
disgraced
upon
the
gallows
than
do
wrong
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
a
few
hours
after
i
throw
my
honour
away
by
the
roadside
in
common
talk
!
'
there
is
one
thing
clear
upon
our
interview
,
'
says
he
,
'
that
i
can
rely
on
your
pledged
word
.
'
where
is
my
word
now
?
who
could
believe
me
now
?
you
could
not
believe
me
.
i
am
clean
fallen
down
;
i
had
best
die
!
"
all
this
i
said
with
a
weeping
voice
,
but
i
had
no
tears
in
my
body
.
"
my
heart
is
sore
for
you
,
"
said
she
,
"
but
be
sure
you
are
too
nice
.
i
would
not
believe
you
,
do
you
say
?
i
would
trust
you
with
anything
.
and
these
men
?
i
would
not
be
thinking
of
them
!
men
who
go
about
to
entrap
and
to
destroy
you
!
fy
!
this
is
no
time
to
crouch
.
look
up
!
do
you
not
think
i
will
be
admiring
you
like
a
great
hero
of
the
good
and
you
a
boy
not
much
older
than
myself
?
and
because
you
said
a
word
too
much
in
a
friend
'
s
ear
,
that
would
die
ere
she
betrayed
you
to
make
such
a
matter
!
it
is
one
thing
that
we
must
both
forget
.
"
"
catriona
,
"
said
i
,
looking
at
her
,
hang
-
dog
,
"
is
this
true
of
it
?
would
ye
trust
me
yet
?
"
"
will
you
not
believe
the
tears
upon
my
face
?
"
she
cried
.
"
it
is
the
world
i
am
thinking
of
you
,
mr
david
balfour
.
let
them
hang
you
;
i
will
never
forget
,
i
will
grow
old
and
still
remember
you
.
i
think
it
is
great
to
die
so
:
i
will
envy
you
that
gallows
.
"
"
and
maybe
all
this
while
i
am
but
a
child
frighted
with
bogles
,
"
said
i
.
"
maybe
they
but
make
a
mock
of
me
.
"
"
it
is
what
i
must
know
,
"
she
said
.
"
i
must
hear
the
whole
.
the
harm
is
done
at
all
events
,
and
i
must
hear
the
whole
.
"
i
had
sat
down
on
the
wayside
,
where
she
took
a
place
beside
me
,
and
i
told
her
all
that
matter
much
as
i
have
written
it
,
my
thoughts
about
her
father
'
s
dealings
being
alone
omitted
.
"
well
,
"
she
said
,
when
i
had
finished
,
"
you
are
a
hero
,
surely
,
and
i
never
would
have
thought
that
same
!
and
i
think
you
are
in
peril
,
too
.
o
,
simon
fraser
!
to
think
upon
that
man
!
for
his
life
and
the
dirty
money
,
to
be
dealing
in
such
traffic
!
"
and
just
then
she
called
out
aloud
with
a
queer
word
that
was
common
with
her
,
and
belongs
,
i
believe
,
to
her
own
language
.
"
my
torture
!
"
says
she
,
"
look
at
the
sun
!
"
indeed
,
it
was
already
dipping
towards
the
mountains
.
she
bid
me
come
again
soon
,
gave
me
her
hand
,
and
left
me
in
a
turmoil
of
glad
spirits
.
i
delayed
to
go
home
to
my
lodging
,
for
i
had
a
terror
of
immediate
arrest
;
but
got
some
supper
at
a
change
house
,
and
the
better
part
of
that
night
walked
by
myself
in
the
barley
-
fields
,
and
had
such
a
sense
of
catriona
'
s
presence
that
i
seemed
to
bear
her
in
my
arms
.
the
next
day
,
august
29th
,
i
kept
my
appointment
at
the
advocate
'
s
in
a
coat
that
i
had
made
to
my
own
measure
,
and
was
but
newly
ready
,
"
aha
,
"
says
prestongrange
,
"
you
are
very
fine
to
-
day
;
my
misses
are
to
have
a
fine
cavalier
.
come
,
i
take
that
kind
of
you
.
i
take
that
kind
of
you
,
mr
david
.
o
,
we
shall
do
very
well
yet
,
and
i
believe
your
troubles
are
nearly
at
an
end
.
"
"
you
have
news
for
me
?
"
cried
i
.
"
beyond
anticipation
,
"
he
replied
.
"
your
testimony
is
after
all
to
be
received
;
and
you
may
go
,
if
you
will
,
in
my
company
to
the
trial
,
which
in
to
be
held
at
inverary
,
thursday
,
21st
proximo
.
"
i
was
too
much
amazed
to
find
words
.
"
in
the
meanwhile
,
"
he
continued
,
"
though
i
will
not
ask
you
to
renew
your
pledge
,
i
must
caution
you
strictly
to
be
reticent
.
to
-
morrow
your
precognition
must
be
taken
;
and
outside
of
that
,
do
you
know
,
i
think
least
said
will
be
soonest
mended
.
"
"
i
shall
try
to
go
discreetly
,
'
said
i
.
"
i
believe
it
is
yourself
that
i
must
thank
for
this
crowning
mercy
,
and
i
do
thank
you
gratefully
.
after
yesterday
,
my
lord
,
this
is
like
the
doors
of
heaven
.
i
cannot
find
it
in
my
heart
to
get
the
thing
believed
.
"
"
ah
,
but
you
must
try
and
manage
,
you
must
try
and
manage
to
believe
it
,
"
says
he
,
soothing
-
like
,
"
and
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
your
acknowledgment
of
obligation
,
for
i
think
you
may
be
able
to
repay
me
very
shortly
"
he
coughed
"
or
even
now
.
the
matter
is
much
changed
.
your
testimony
,
which
i
shall
not
trouble
you
for
to
-
day
,
will
doubtless
alter
the
complexion
of
the
case
for
all
concerned
,
and
this
makes
it
less
delicate
for
me
to
enter
with
you
on
a
side
issue
.
"
"
my
lord
,
"
i
interrupted
,
"
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
,
but
how
has
this
been
brought
about
?
the
obstacles
you
told
me
of
on
saturday
appeared
even
to
me
to
be
quite
insurmountable
;
how
has
it
been
contrived
?
"
"
my
dear
mr
david
,
"
said
he
,
"
it
would
never
do
for
me
to
divulge
(
even
to
you
,
as
you
say
)
the
councils
of
the
government
;
and
you
must
content
yourself
,
if
you
please
,
with
the
gross
fact
.
"
he
smiled
upon
me
like
a
father
as
he
spoke
,
playing
the
while
with
a
new
pen
;
methought
it
was
impossible
there
could
be
any
shadow
of
deception
in
the
man
:
yet
when
he
drew
to
him
a
sheet
of
paper
,
dipped
his
pen
among
the
ink
,
and
began
again
to
address
me
,
i
was
somehow
not
so
certain
,
and
fell
instinctively
into
an
attitude
of
guard
.
"
there
is
a
point
i
wish
to
touch
upon
,
"
he
began
.
"
i
purposely
left
it
before
upon
one
side
,
which
need
be
now
no
longer
necessary
.
this
is
not
,
of
course
,
a
part
of
your
examination
,
which
is
to
follow
by
another
hand
;
this
is
a
private
interest
of
my
own
.
you
say
you
encountered
alan
breck
upon
the
hill
?
"
"
i
did
,
my
lord
,
"
said
i
"
this
was
immediately
after
the
murder
?
"
"
it
was
.
"
"
did
you
speak
to
him
?
"
"
i
did
.
"
"
you
had
known
him
before
,
i
think
?
"
says
my
lord
,
carelessly
.
"
i
cannot
guess
your
reason
for
so
thinking
,
my
lord
,
"
i
replied
,
"
but
such
in
the
fact
.
"
"
and
when
did
you
part
with
him
again
?
"
said
he
.
"
i
reserve
my
answer
,
"
said
i
.
"
the
question
will
be
put
to
me
at
the
assize
.
"
"
mr
.
balfour
,
"
said
he
,
"
will
you
not
understand
that
all
this
is
without
prejudice
to
yourself
?
i
have
promised
you
life
and
honour
;
and
,
believe
me
,
i
can
keep
my
word
.
you
are
therefore
clear
of
all
anxiety
.
alan
,
it
appears
,
you
suppose
you
can
protect
;
and
you
talk
to
me
of
your
gratitude
,
which
i
think
(
if
you
push
me
)
is
not
ill
-
deserved
.
there
are
a
great
many
different
considerations
all
pointing
the
same
way
;
and
i
will
never
be
persuaded
that
you
could
not
help
us
(
if
you
chose
)
to
put
salt
on
alan
'
s
tail
.
"
"
my
lord
,
"
said
i
,
"
i
give
you
my
word
i
do
not
so
much
as
guess
where
alan
is
.
"
he
paused
a
breath
.
"
nor
how
he
might
be
found
?
"
he
asked
.
i
sat
before
him
like
a
log
of
wood
.
"
and
so
much
for
your
gratitude
,
mr
david
!
"
he
observed
.
again
there
was
a
piece
of
silence
.
"
well
,
"
said
he
,
rising
,
"
i
am
not
fortunate
,
and
we
are
a
couple
at
cross
purposes
.
let
us
speak
of
it
no
more
;
you
will
receive
notice
when
,
where
,
and
by
whom
,
we
are
to
take
your
precognition
.
and
in
the
meantime
,
my
misses
must
be
waiting
you
.
they
will
never
forgive
me
if
i
detain
their
cavalier
.
"
into
the
hands
of
these
graces
i
was
accordingly
offered
up
,
and
found
them
dressed
beyond
what
i
had
thought
possible
,
and
looking
fair
as
a
posy
.
as
we
went
forth
from
the
doors
a
small
circumstance
occurred
which
came
afterwards
to
look
extremely
big
.
i
heard
a
whistle
sound
loud
and
brief
like
a
signal
,
and
looking
all
about
,
spied
for
one
moment
the
red
head
of
neil
of
the
tom
,
the
son
of
duncan
.
the
next
moment
he
was
gone
again
,
nor
could
i
see
so
much
as
the
skirt
-
tail
of
catriona
,
upon
whom
i
naturally
supposed
him
to
be
then
attending
.
my
three
keepers
led
me
out
by
bristo
and
the
bruntsfield
links
;
whence
a
path
carried
us
to
hope
park
,
a
beautiful
pleasance
,
laid
with
gravel
-
walks
,
furnished
with
seats
and
summer
-
sheds
,
and
warded
by
a
keeper
.
the
way
there
was
a
little
longsome
;
the
two
younger
misses
affected
an
air
of
genteel
weariness
