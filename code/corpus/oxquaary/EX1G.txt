'
i
slept
little
,
hurried
over
my
breakfast
,
and
after
a
slight
hesitation
gave
up
my
early
morning
visit
to
my
ship
.
it
was
really
very
wrong
of
me
,
because
,
though
my
chief
mate
was
an
excellent
man
all
round
,
he
was
the
victim
of
such
black
imaginings
that
if
he
did
not
get
a
letter
from
his
wife
at
the
expected
time
he
would
go
quite
distracted
with
rage
and
jealousy
,
lose
all
grip
on
the
work
,
quarrel
with
all
hands
,
and
either
weep
in
his
cabin
or
develop
such
a
ferocity
of
temper
as
all
but
drove
the
crew
to
the
verge
of
mutiny
.
the
thing
had
always
seemed
inexplicable
to
me
:
they
had
been
married
thirteen
years
;
i
had
a
glimpse
of
her
once
,
and
,
honestly
,
i
could
not
conceive
a
man
abandoned
enough
to
plunge
into
sin
for
the
sake
of
such
an
unattractive
person
.
i
do
not
know
whether
i
have
not
done
wrong
by
refraining
from
putting
that
view
before
poor
selvin
:
the
man
made
a
little
hell
on
earth
for
himself
,
and
i
also
suffered
indirectly
,
but
some
sort
of
,
no
doubt
,
false
delicacy
prevented
me
.
the
marital
relations
of
seamen
would
make
an
interesting
subject
,
and
i
could
tell
you
instances
.
.
.
.
however
,
this
is
not
the
place
,
nor
the
time
,
and
we
are
concerned
with
jim
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
who
was
unmarried
.
if
his
imaginative
conscience
or
his
pride
;
if
all
the
extravagant
ghosts
and
austere
shades
that
were
the
disastrous
familiars
of
his
youth
would
not
let
him
run
away
from
the
block
,
i
,
who
of
course
ca
not
be
suspected
of
such
familiars
,
was
irresistibly
impelled
to
go
and
see
his
head
roll
off
.
i
wended
my
way
towards
the
court
.
i
did
not
hope
to
be
very
much
impressed
or
edified
,
or
interested
or
even
frightened
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
though
,
as
long
as
there
is
any
life
before
one
,
a
jolly
good
fright
now
and
then
is
a
salutary
discipline
.
but
neither
did
i
expect
to
be
so
awfully
depressed
.
the
bitterness
of
his
punishment
was
in
its
chill
and
mean
atmosphere
.
the
real
significance
of
crime
is
in
its
being
a
breach
of
faith
with
the
community
of
mankind
,
and
from
that
point
of
view
he
was
no
mean
traitor
,
but
his
execution
was
a
hole
-
and
-
corner
affair
.
there
was
no
high
scaffolding
,
no
scarlet
cloth
(
did
they
have
scarlet
cloth
on
tower
hill
?
they
should
have
had
)
,
no
awe
-
stricken
multitude
to
be
horrified
at
his
guilt
and
be
moved
to
tears
at
his
fate
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
no
air
of
sombre
retribution
.
there
was
,
as
i
walked
along
,
the
clear
sunshine
,
a
brilliance
too
passionate
to
be
consoling
,
the
streets
full
of
jumbled
bits
of
colour
like
a
damaged
kaleidoscope
:
yellow
,
green
,
blue
,
dazzling
white
,
the
brown
nudity
of
an
undraped
shoulder
,
a
bullock
-
cart
with
a
red
canopy
,
a
company
of
native
infantry
in
a
drab
body
with
dark
heads
marching
in
dusty
laced
boots
,
a
native
policeman
in
a
sombre
uniform
of
scanty
cut
and
belted
in
patent
leather
,
who
looked
up
at
me
with
orientally
pitiful
eyes
as
though
his
migrating
spirit
were
suffering
exceedingly
from
that
unforeseen
.

under
the
shade
of
a
lonely
tree
in
the
courtyard
,
the
villagers
connected
with
the
assault
case
sat
in
a
picturesque
group
,
looking
like
a
chromo
-
lithograph
of
a
camp
in
a
book
of
eastern
travel
.
one
missed
the
obligatory
thread
of
smoke
in
the
foreground
and
the
pack
-
animals
grazing
.
a
blank
yellow
wall
rose
behind
overtopping
the
tree
,
reflecting
the
glare
.
the
court
-
room
was
sombre
,
seemed
more
vast
.
high
up
in
the
dim
space
the
punkahs
were
swaying
short
to
and
fro
,
to
and
fro
.
here
and
there
a
draped
figure
,
dwarfed
by
the
bare
walls
,
remained
without
stirring
amongst
the
rows
of
empty
benches
,
as
if
absorbed
in
pious
meditation
.
the
plaintiff
,
who
had
been
beaten
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
an
obese
chocolate
-
coloured
man
with
shaved
head
,
one
fat
breast
bare
and
a
bright
yellow
caste
-
mark
above
the
bridge
of
his
nose
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
sat
in
pompous
immobility
:
only
his
eyes
glittered
,
rolling
in
the
gloom
,
and
the
nostrils
dilated
and
collapsed
violently
as
he
breathed
.
brierly
dropped
into
his
seat
looking
done
up
,
as
though
he
had
spent
the
night
in
sprinting
on
a
cinder
-
track
.
the
pious
sailing
-
ship
skipper
appeared
excited
and
made
uneasy
movements
,
as
if
restraining
with
difficulty
an
impulse
to
stand
up
and
exhort
us
earnestly
to
prayer
and
repentance
.
the
head
of
the
magistrate
,
delicately
pale
under
the
neatly
arranged
hair
,
resembled
the
head
of
a
hopeless
invalid
after
he
had
been
washed
and
brushed
and
propped
up
in
bed
.
he
moved
aside
the
vase
of
flowers
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
bunch
of
purple
with
a
few
pink
blossoms
on
long
stalks
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
seizing
in
both
hands
a
long
sheet
of
bluish
paper
,
ran
his
eye
over
it
,
propped
his
forearms
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
,
and
began
to
read
aloud
in
an
even
,
distinct
,
and
careless
voice
.

for
all
my
foolishness
about
scaffolds
and
heads
rolling
off
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
assure
you
it
was
infinitely
worse
than
a
beheading
.
a
heavy
sense
of
finality
brooded
over
all
this
,
unrelieved
by
the
hope
of
rest
and
safety
following
the
fall
of
the
axe
.
these
proceedings
had
all
the
cold
vengefulness
of
a
death
-
sentence
,
and
the
cruelty
of
a
sentence
of
exile
.
this
is
how
i
looked
at
it
that
morning
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
even
now
i
seem
to
see
an
undeniable
vestige
of
truth
in
that
exaggerated
view
of
a
common
occurrence
.
you
may
imagine
how
strongly
i
felt
this
at
the
time
.
perhaps
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
admit
the
finality
.
the
thing
was
always
with
me
,
i
was
always
eager
to
take
opinion
on
it
,
as
though
it
had
not
been
practically
settled
:
individual
opinion
.
.
.
.
.

international
opinion

that
frenchman
'
s
,
for
instance
.
his
own
country
'
s
pronouncement
was
uttered
in
the
passionless
and
definite
phraseology
a
machine
would
use
,
if
machines
could
speak
.
the
head
of
the
magistrate
was
half
hidden
by
the
paper
,
his
brow
was
like
alabaster
.
'
there
were
several
questions
before
the
court
.
the
first
as
to
whether
the
ship
was
in
every
respect
fit
and
seaworthy
for
the
voyage
.
the
court
found
she
was
not
.
the
next
point
,
i
remember
,
was
,
whether
up
to
the
time
of
the
accident
the
ship
had
been
navigated
with
proper
and
seamanlike
care
.
they
said
yes
to
that
,
goodness
knows
why
,
and
then
they
declared
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
the
exact
cause
of
the
accident
.
a
floating
derelict
probably
.
i
myself
remember
that
a
norwegian
barque
bound
out
with
a
cargo
of
pitch
-
pine
had
been
given
up
as
missing
about
that
time
,
and
it
was
just
the
sort
of
craft
that
would
capsize
in
a
squall
and
float
bottom
up
for
months
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
kind
of
maritime
ghoul
on
the
prowl
to
kill
ships
in
the
dark
.
such
wandering
corpses
are
common
enough
in
the
north
atlantic
,
which
is
haunted
by
all
the
terrors
of
the
sea
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
fogs
,
icebergs
,
dead
ships
bent
upon
mischief
,
and
long
sinister
gales
that
fasten
upon
one
like
a
vampire
till
all
the
strength
and
the
spirit
and
even
hope
are
gone
,
and
one
feels
like
the
empty
shell
of
a
man
.
but
there
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
those
seas
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
incident
was
rare
enough
to
resemble
a
special
arrangement
of
a
malevolent
providence
,
which
,
unless
it
had
for
its
object
the
killing
of
a
donkeyman
and
the
bringing
of
worse
than
death
upon
jim
,
appeared
an
utterly
aimless
piece
of
devilry
.
this
view
occurring
to
me
took
off
my
attention
.
for
a
time
i
was
aware
of
the
magistrate
'
s
voice
as
a
sound
merely
;
but
in
a
moment
it
shaped
itself
into
distinct
words
.
.
.
in
utter
disregard
of
their
plain
duty
,
"
it
said
.
the
next
sentence
escaped
me
somehow
,
and
then
.
.
.
abandoning
in
the
moment
of
danger
the
lives
and
property
confided
to
their
charge
"
.
.
.
went
on
the
voice
evenly
,
and
stopped
.
a
pair
of
eyes
under
the
white
forehead
shot
darkly
a
glance
above
the
edge
of
the
paper
.
i
looked
for
jim
hurriedly
,
as
though
i
had
expected
him
to
disappear
.
he
was
very
still
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
he
was
there
.
he
sat
pink
and
fair
and
extremely
attentive
.
therefore
,
.
.
.
began
the
voice
emphatically
.
he
stared
with
parted
lips
,
hanging
upon
the
words
of
the
man
behind
the
desk
.
these
came
out
into
the
stillness
wafted
on
the
wind
made
by
the
punkahs
,
and
i
,
watching
for
their
effect
upon
him
,
caught
only
the
fragments
of
official
language
.
.

"
a
silence
fell
.
the
magistrate
had
dropped
the
paper
,
and
,
leaning
sideways
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
,
began
to
talk
with
brierly
easily
.
people
started
to
move
out
;
others
were
pushing
in
,
and
i
also
made
for
the
door
.
outside
i
stood
still
,
and
when
jim
passed
me
on
his
way
to
the
gate
,
i
caught
at
his
arm
and
detained
him
.
the
look
he
gave
discomposed
me
,
as
though
i
had
been
responsible
for
his
state
he
looked
at
me
as
if
i
had
been
the
embodied
evil
of
life
.
it
is
all
over
,
"
i
stammered
.
yes
,
"
he
said
thickly
.
and
now
let
no
man
.
.
.
he
jerked
his
arm
out
of
my
grasp
.
i
watched
his
back
as
he
went
away
.
it
was
a
long
street
,
and
he
remained
in
sight
for
some
time
.
he
walked
rather
slow
,
and
straddling
his
legs
a
little
,
as
if
he
had
found
it
difficult
to
keep
a
straight
line
.
just
before
i
lost
him
i
fancied
he
staggered
a
bit
.
man
overboard
,
"
said
a
deep
voice
behind
me
.
turning
round
,
i
saw
a
fellow
i
knew
slightly
,
a
west
australian
;
chester
was
his
name
.
he
,
too
,
had
been
looking
after
jim
.
he
was
a
man
with
an
immense
girth
of
chest
,
a
rugged
,
clean
-
shaved
face
of
mahogany
colour
,
and
two
blunt
tufts
of
iron
-
grey
,
thick
,
wiry
hairs
on
his
upper
lip
.
he
had
been
pearler
,
wrecker
,
trader
,
whaler
too
,
i
believe
;
in
his
own
words
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
anything
and
everything
a
man
may
be
at
sea
,
but
a
pirate
.
the
pacific
,
north
and
south
,
was
his
proper
hunting
-
ground
;
but
he
had
wandered
so
far
afield
looking
for
a
cheap
steamer
to
buy
.
lately
he
had
discovered
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
so
he
said
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
guano
island
somewhere
,
but
its
approaches
were
dangerous
,
and
the
anchorage
,
such
as
it
was
,
could
not
be
considered
safe
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
.
as
good
as
a
gold
-
mine
,
"
he
would
exclaim
.
right
bang
in
the
middle
of
the
walpole
reefs
,
and
if
it
is
true
enough
that
you
can
get
no
holding
-
ground
anywhere
in
less
than
forty
fathom
,
then
what
of
that
?
there
are
the
hurricanes
,
too
.
but
it
is
a
first
-
rate
thing
.
as
good
as
a
gold
-
mine

.

there
'

not

will

it

ca
not

i
made
up
my
mind
to

the
blessed
stuff

.
.
.
this
was
what
he
required
a
steamer
for
,
and
i
knew
he
was
just
then

enthusiastically

side
of
stewart
island
;
that
'
s
right
;
seven
of
them
got
ashore
,
and
it
seems
they
did
not
get
on
very
well
together
.
some
men
are
too
cantankerous
for
anything
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
do
not
know
how
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
job
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
do
not
see
things
as
they
are
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
they
are
,
my
boy
!
and
then
what
'
s
the
consequence
?
obvious
!
trouble
,
trouble
;
as
likely
as
not
a
knock
on
the
head
;
and
serve
'
em
right
too
.
that
sort
is
the
most
useful
when
it
is
dead
.
the
story
goes
that
a
boat
of
her
majesty
'
s
ship
wolverine
found
him
kneeling
on
the
kelp
,
naked
as
the
day
he
was
born
,
and
chanting
some
psalm
-
tune
or
other
;
light
snow
was
falling
at
the
time
.
he
waited
till
the
boat
was
an
oar
'
s
length
from
the
shore
,
and
then
up
and
away
.
they
chased
him
for
an
hour
up
and
down
the
boulders
,
till
a
marihe
flung
a
stone
that
took
him
behind
the
ear
providentially
and
knocked
him
senseless
.
alone
?
of
course
.
but
that
'
s
like
that
tale
of
sealing
-
schooners
;
the
lord
god
knows
the
right
and
the
wrong
of
that
story
.
the
cutter
did
not
investigate
much
.
they
wrapped
him
in
a
boat
-
cloak
and
took
him
off
as
quick
as
they
could
,
with
a
dark
night
coming
on
,
the
weather
threatening
,
and
the
ship
firing
recall
guns
every
five
minutes
.
three
weeks
afterwards
he
was
as
well
as
ever
.
he
did
not
allow
any
fuss
that
was
made
on
shore
to
upset
him
;
he
just
shut
his
lips
tight
,
and
let
people
screech
.
it
was
bad
enough
to
have
lost
his
ship
,
and
all
he
was
worth
besides
,
without
paying
attention
to
the
hard
names
they
called
him
.
that
'
s
the
man
for
me
.
"
he
lifted
his
arm
for
a
signal
to
some
one
down
the
street
.
he
is
got
a
little
money
,
so
i
had
to
let
him
into
my
thing
.
had
to
!
it
would
have
been
sinful
to
throw
away
such
a
find
,
and
i
was
cleaned
out
myself
.
it
cut
me
to
the
quick
,
but
i
could
see
the
matter
just
as
it
was
,
and
if
i
must
share
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
thinks
i
.
.
.
.
.
.
with
any
man
,
then
give
me
robinson
.
i
left
him
at
breakfast
in
the
hotel
to
come
to
court
,
because
i
'
ve
an
idea
.
.
.
.
ah
!
good
morning
,
captain
robinson
.
.
.
.
friend
of
mine
,
captain
robinson

"
'
an
emaciated
patriarch
in
a
suit
of
white
drill
,
a
solah
topi
with
a
green
-
lined
rim
on
a
head
trembling
with
age
,
joined
us
after
crossing
the
street
in
a
trotting
shuffle
,
and
stood
propped
with
both
hands
on
the
handle
of
an
umbrella
.
a
white
beard
with
amber
streaks
hung
lumpily
down
to
his
waist
.
he
blinked
his
creased
eyelids
at
me
in
a
bewildered
way
.
how
do
you
do
?
how
do
you
do
?
"
he
piped
amiably
,
and
tottered
.
a
little
deaf
,
"
said
chester
aside
.
did
you
drag
him
over
six
thousand
miles
to
get
a
cheap
steamer
?
"
i
asked
.
i
would
have
taken
him
twice
round
the
world
as
soon
as
look
at
him
,
"
said
chester
with
immense
energy
.
the
steamer
will
be
the
making
of
us
,
my
lad
.
is
it
my
fault
that
every
skipper
and
shipowner
in
the
whole
of
blessed
australasia
turns
out
a
blamed
fool
?
once
i
talked
for
three
hours
to
a
man
in
auckland
.
'
send
a
ship
,
'
i
said
,
'
send
a
ship
.
i
will
give
you
half
of

.
.
.
.
.
.
just
to
make
a
good

'
says
he
,
'
i
would
not
do
it
if
there
was
no
other
place
on
earth
to
send
a
ship
to

i
nearly
went
on
my
knees
to
him

.

'
that
'

one
of
your
little
jokes

chester
,
'
he
says
.
.
.
.
joke
!
i
could
have
wept
.
ask
captain
robinson
here
.
.
.
.
and
there
was
another
shipowning
fellow
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
fat
chap
in
a
white
waistcoat
in
wellington
,
who
seemed
to
think
i
was
up
to
some
swindle
or
other
.
'
i
do
not
know
what
sort
of
fool
you
are
looking
for
,
'
he
says
,
'
but
i
am
busy
just
now
.
good
morning
.
'
i
longed
to
take
him
in
my
two
hands
and
smash
him
through
the
window
of
his
own
office
.
but
i
didn
'
t
.
i
was
as
mild
as
a
curate
.
'
think
of
it
,
'
says
i
.
'
do
think
it
over
.
i
will
call
to
-
morrow
.
'
he
grunted
something
about
being
'
out
all
day
.
'
on
the
stairs
i
felt
ready
to
beat
my
head
against
the
wall
from
vexation
.
captain
robinson
here
can
tell
you
.
it
was
awful
to
think
of
all
that
lovely
stuff
lying
waste
under
the
sun
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
stuff
that
would
send
the
sugar
-
cane
shooting
sky
-
high
.
the
making
of
queensland
!
the
making
of
queensland
!
and
in
brisbane
,
where
i
went
to
have
a
last
try
,
they
gave
me
the
name
of
a
lunatic
.
idiots
!
the
only
sensible
man
i
came
across
was
the
cabman
who
drove
me
about
.
a
broken
-
down
swell
he
was
,
i
fancy
.
hey
!
captain
robinson
?
you
remember
i
told
you
about
my
cabby
in
brisbane
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
do
not
you
?
the
chap
had
a
wonderful
eye
for
things
.
he
saw
it
all
in
a
jiffy
.
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
talk
with
him
.
one
evening
after
a
devil
of
a
day
amongst
shipowners
i
felt
so
bad
that
,
says
i
,
'
i
must
get
drunk
.
come
along
;
i
must
get
drunk
,
or
i
will
go
mad
.
'
'
i
am
your
man
,
'
he
says
;
'
go
ahead
.
'
i
do
not
know
what
i
would
have
done
without
him
.
hey
!
captain
robinson
.
"
'
he
poked
the
ribs
of
his
partner
.
he
!
he
!
he
!
"
laughed
the
ancient
,
looked
aimlessly
down
the
street
,
then
peered
at
me
doubtfully
with
sad
,
dim
pupils
.
.
.
.
he
!
he
!
he
!
"
.
.
.
he
leaned
heavier
on
the
umbrella
,
and
dropped
his
gaze
on
the
ground
.
i
need
not
tell
you
i
had
tried
to
get
away
several
times
,
but
chester
had
foiled
every
attempt
by
simply
catching
hold
of
my
coat
.
one
minute
.
i
'
ve
a
notion
.
"
"
what
'
s
your
infernal
notion
?
"
i
exploded
at
last
.
if
you
think
i
am
going
in
with
you
.
.
.
"
no
,
no
,
my
boy
.
too
late
,
if
you
wanted
ever
so
much
.
we
'
ve
got
a
steamer
.
"
"
you
'
ve
got
the
ghost
of
a
steamer
,
"
i
said
.
good
enough
for
a
start
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
there
'
s
no
superior
nonsense
about
us
.
is
there
,
captain
robinson
?
"
"
no
!
no
!
no
!
"
croaked
the
old
man
without
lifting
his
eyes
,
and
the
senile
tremble
of
his
head
became
almost
fierce
with
determination
.
i
understand
you
know
that
young
chap
,
"
said
chester
,
with
a
nod
at
the
street
from
which
jim
had
disappeared
long
ago
.
he
is
been
having
grub
with
you
in
the
malabar
last
night
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
so
i
was
told
.
"
'
i
said
that
was
true
,
and
after
remarking
that
he
too
liked
to
live
well
and
in
style
,
only
that
,
for
the
present
,
he
had
to
be
saving
of
every
penny
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
none
too
many
for
the
business
!
is
not
that
so
,
captain
robinson
?
"
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
squared
his
shoulders
and
stroked
his
dumpy
moustache
,
while
the
notorious
robinson
,
coughing
at
his
side
,
clung
more
than
ever
to
the
handle
of
the
umbrella
,
and
seemed
ready
to
subside
passively
into
a
heap
of
old
bones
.
you
see
,
the
old
chap
has
all
the
money
,
"
whispered
chester
confidentially
.
i
'
ve
been
cleaned
out
trying
to
engineer
the
dratted
thing
.
but
wait
a
bit
,
wait
a
bit
.
the
good
time
is
coming
.
"
.
.
.
he
seemed
suddenly
astonished
at
the
signs
of
impatience
i
gave
.
oh
,
crakee
!
"
he
cried
;
"
i
am
telling
you
of
the
biggest
thing
that
ever
was
,
and
you
.
.
.
"
i
have
an
appointment
,
"
i
pleaded
mildly
.
what
of
that
?
"
he
asked
with
genuine
surprise
;
"
let
it
wait
.
"
"
that
'
s
exactly
what
i
am
doing
now
,
"
i
remarked
;
"
had
not
you
better
tell
me
what
it
is
you
want
?
"
"
buy
twenty
hotels
like
that
,
"
he
growled
to
himself
;
"
and
every
joker
boarding
in
them
too
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
twenty
times
over
.
"
he
lifted
his
head
smartly
"
i
want
that
young
chap
.
"
"
i
do
not
understand
,
"
i
said
.
he
is
no
good
,
is
he
?
"
said
chester
crisply
.
i
know
nothing
about
it
,
"
i
protested
.
why
,
you
told
me
yourself
he
was
taking
it
to
heart
,
"
argued
chester
.
well
,
in
my
opinion
a
chap
who
.
.
.
anyhow
,
he
ca
not
be
much
good
;
but
then
you
see
i
am
on
the
look
-
out
for
somebody
,
and
i
'
ve
just
got
a
thing
that
will
suit
him
.
i
will
give
him
a
job
on
my
island
.
"
he
nodded
significantly
.
i
am
going
to
dump
forty
coolies
there
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
if
i
'
ve
to
steal
'
em
.
somebody
must
work
the
stuff
.
oh
!
i
mean
to
act
square
:
wooden
shed
,
corrugated
-
iron
roof
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
know
a
man
in
hobart
who
will
take
my
bill
at
six
months
for
the
materials
.
i
do
.
honour
bright
.
then
there
'
s
the
water
-
supply
.
i
will
have
to
fly
round
and
get
somebody
to
trust
me
for
half
-
a
-
dozen
second
-
hand
iron
tanks
.
catch
rain
-
water
,
hey
?
let
him
take
charge
.
make
him
supreme
boss
over
the
coolies
.
good
idea
,
is
not
it
?
what
do
you
say
?
"
"
there
are
whole
years
when
not
a
drop
of
rain
falls
on
walpole
,
"
i
said
,
too
amazed
to
laugh
.
he
bit
his
lip
and
seemed
bothered
.
oh
,
well
,
i
will
fix
up
something
for
them
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
or
land
a
supply
.
hang
it
all
!
that
'
s
not
the
question
.
"
'
i
said
nothing
.
i
had
a
rapid
vision
of
jim
perched
on
a
shadowless
rock
,
up
to
his
knees
in
guano
,
with
the
screams
of
sea
-
birds
in
his
ears
,
the
incandescent
ball
of
the
sun
above
his
head
;
the
empty
sky
and
the
empty
ocean
all
a
-
quiver
,
simmering
together
in
the
heat
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
.
i
would
not
advise
my
worst
enemy
.
.
.
i
began
.
what
'
s
the
matter
with
you
?
"
cried
chester
;
"
i
mean
to
give
him
a
good
screw
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
is
,
as
soon
as
the
thing
is
set
going
,
of
course
.
it
is
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
.
simply
nothing
to
do
;
two
six
-
shooters
in
his
belt
.
.
.
surely
he
would
not
be
afraid
of
anything
forty
coolies
could
do
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
with
two
six
-
shooters
and
he
the
only
armed
man
too
!
it
is
much
better
than
it
looks
.
i
want
you
to
help
me
to
talk
him
over
.
"
"
no
!
"
i
shouted
.
old
robinson
lifted
his
bleared
eyes
dismally
for
a
moment
,
chester
looked
at
me
with
infinite
contempt
.
so
you
would
not
advise
him
?
"
he
uttered
slowly
.
certainly
not
,
"
i
answered
,
as
indignant
as
though
he
had
requested
me
to
help
murder
somebody
;
"
moreover
,
i
am
sure
he
wouldn
'
t
.
he
is
badly
cut
up
,
but
he
is
not
mad
as
far
as
i
know
.
"
"
he
is
no
earthly
good
for
anything
,
"
chester
mused
aloud
.
he
would
just
have
done
for
me
.
if
you
only
could
see
a
thing
as
it
is
,
you
would
see
it
is
the
very
thing
for
him
.
and
besides
.
.
.
why
!
it
is
the
most
splendid
,
sure
chance
.
.
.
he
got
angry
suddenly
.
i
must
have
a
man
.
there
!
.
.
.
he
stamped
his
foot
and
smiled
unpleasantly
.
anyhow
,
i
could
guarantee
the
island
would
not
sink
under
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
i
believe
he
is
a
bit
particular
on
that
point
.
"
"
good
morning
,
"
i
said
curtly
.
he
looked
at
me
as
though
i
had
been
an
incomprehensible
fool
.
.
.
.
must
be
moving
,
captain
robinson
,
"
he
yelled
suddenly
into
the
old
man
'
s
ear
.
these
parsee
johnnies
are
waiting
for
us
to
clinch
the
bargain
.
"
he
took
his
partner
under
the
arm
with
a
firm
grip
,
swung
him
round
,
and
,
unexpectedly
,
leered
at
me
over
his
shoulder
.
i
was
trying
to
do
him
a
kindness
,
"
he
asserted
,
with
an
air
and
tone
that
made
my
blood
boil
.
thank
you
for
nothing
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
his
name
,
"
i
rejoined
.
oh
!
you
are
devilish
smart
,
"
he
sneered
;
"
but
you
are
like
the
rest
of
them
.
too
much
in
the
clouds
.
see
what
you
will
do
with
him
.
"
"
i
do
not
know
that
i
want
to
do
anything
with
him
.
"
"
do
not
you
?
"
he
spluttered
;
his
grey
moustache
bristled
with
anger
,
and
by
his
side
the
notorious
robinson
,
propped
on
the
umbrella
,
stood
with
his
back
to
me
,
as
patient
and
still
as
a
worn
-
out
cab
-
horse
.
i
have
not
found
a
guano
island
,
"
i
said
.
it
is
my
belief
you
would
not
know
one
if
you
were
led
right
up
to
it
by
the
hand
,
"
he
riposted
quickly
;
"
and
in
this
world
you
'
ve
got
to
see
a
thing
first
,
before
you
can
make
use
of
it
.
got
to
see
it
through
and
through
at
that
,
neither
more
nor
less
.
"
"
and
get
others
to
see
it
,
too
,
"
i
insinuated
,
with
a
glance
at
the
bowed
back
by
his
side
.
chester
snorted
at
me
.
his
eyes
are
right
enough
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
do
not
you
worry
.
he
ai
not
a
puppy
.
"
"
oh
,
dear
,
no
!
"
i
said
.
come
along
,
captain
robinson
,
"
he
shouted
,
with
a
sort
of
bullying
deference
under
the
rim
of
the
old
man
'
s
hat
;
the
holy
terror
gave
a
submissive
little
jump
.
the
ghost
of
a
steamer
was
waiting
for
them
,
fortune
on
that
fair
isle
!
they
made
a
curious
pair
of
argonauts
.
chester
strode
on
leisurely
,
well
set
up
,
portly
,
and
of
conquering
mien
;
the
other
,
long
,
wasted
,
drooping
,
and
hooked
to
his
arm
,
shuffled
his
withered
shanks
with
desperate
haste
.
'
'
i
did
not
start
in
search
of
jim
at
once
,
only
because
i
had
really
an
appointment
which
i
could
not
neglect
.
then
,
as
ill
-
luck
would
have
it
,
in
my
agent
'
s
office
i
was
fastened
upon
by
a
fellow
fresh
from
madagascar
with
a
little
scheme
for
a
wonderful
piece
of
business
.
it
had
something
to
do
with
cattle
and
cartridges
and
a
prince
ravonalo
something
;
but
the
pivot
of
the
whole
affair
was
the
stupidity
of
some
admiral
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
admiral
pierre
,
i
think
.
everything
turned
on
that
,
and
the
chap
could
not
find
words
strong
enough
to
express
his
confidence
.
he
had
globular
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
with
a
fishy
glitter
,
bumps
on
his
forehead
,
and
wore
his
long
hair
brushed
back
without
a
parting
.
he
had
a
favourite
phrase
which
he
kept
on
repeating
triumphantly
,
"
the
minimum
of
risk
with
the
maximum
of
profit
is
my
motto
.
what
?
"
he
made
my
head
ache
,
spoiled
my
tiffin
,
but
got
his
own
out
of
me
all
right
;
and
as
soon
as
i
had
shaken
him
off
,
i
made
straight
for
the
water
-
side
.
i
caught
sight
of
jim
leaning
over
the
parapet
of
the
quay
.
three
native
boatmen
quarrelling
over
five
annas
were
making
an
awful
row
at
his
elbow
.
he
did
not
hear
me
come
up
,
but
spun
round
as
if
the
slight
contact
of
my
finger
had
released
a
catch
.
i
was
looking
,
"
he
stammered
.
i
do
not
remember
what
i
said
,
not
much
anyhow
,
but
he
made
no
difficulty
in
following
me
to
the
hotel
.
'
he
followed
me
as
manageable
as
a
little
child
,
with
an
obedient
air
,
with
no
sort
of
manifestation
,
rather
as
though
he
had
been
waiting
for
me
there
to
come
along
and
carry
him
off
.
i
need
not
have
been
so
surprised
as
i
was
at
his
tractability
.
on
all
the
round
earth
,
which
to
some
seems
so
big
and
that
others
affect
to
consider
as
rather
smaller
than
a
mustard
-
seed
,
he
had
no
place
where
he
could
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
what
shall
i
say
?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
where
he
could
withdraw
.
that
'
s
it
!
withdraw
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
be
alone
with
his
loneliness
.
he
walked
by
my
side
very
calm
,
glancing
here
and
there
,
and
once
turned
his
head
to
look
after
a
sidiboy
fireman
in
a
cutaway
coat
and
yellowish
trousers
,
whose
black
face
had
silky
gleams
like
a
lump
of
anthracite
coal
.
i
doubt
,
however
,
whether
he
saw
anything
,
or
even
remained
all
the
time
aware
of
my
companionship
,
because
if
i
had
not
edged
him
to
the
left
here
,
or
pulled
him
to
the
right
there
,
i
believe
he
would
have
gone
straight
before
him
in
any
direction
till
stopped
by
a
wall
or
some
other
obstacle
.
i
steered
him
into
my
bedroom
,
and
sat
down
at
once
to
write
letters
.
this
was
the
only
place
in
the
world
(
unless
,
perhaps
,
the
walpole
reef
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
that
was
not
so
handy
)
where
he
could
have
it
out
with
himself
without
being
bothered
by
the
rest
of
the
universe
.
the
damned
thing
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
he
had
expressed
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
had
not
made
him
invisible
,
but
i
behaved
exactly
as
though
he
were
.
no
sooner
in
my
chair
i
bent
over
my
writing
-
desk
like
a
medieval
scribe
,
and
,
but
for
the
movement
of
the
hand
holding
the
pen
,
remained
anxiously
quiet
.
i
ca
not
say
i
was
frightened
;
but
i
certainly
kept
as
still
as
if
there
had
been
something
dangerous
in
the
room
,
that
at
the
first
hint
of
a
movement
on
my
part
would
be
provoked
to
pounce
upon
me
.
there
was
not
much
in
the
room
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
know
how
these
bedrooms
are
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
sort
of
four
-
poster
bedstead
under
a
mosquito
-
net
,
two
or
three
chairs
,
the
table
i
was
writing
at
,
a
bare
floor
.
a
glass
door
opened
on
an
upstairs
verandah
,
and
he
stood
with
his
face
to
it
,
having
a
hard
time
with
all
possible
privacy
.
dusk
fell
;
i
lit
a
candle
with
the
greatest
economy
of
movement
and
as
much
prudence
as
though
it
were
an
illegal
proceeding
.
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
had
a
very
hard
time
of
it
,
and
so
had
i
,
even
to
the
point
,
i
must
own
,
of
wishing
him
to
the
devil
,
or
on
walpole
reef
at
least
.
it
occurred
to
me
once
or
twice
that
,
after
all
,
chester
was
,
perhaps
,
the
man
to
deal
effectively
with
such
a
disaster
.
that
strange
idealist
had
found
a
practical
use
for
it
at
once
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
unerringly
,
as
it
were
.
it
was
enough
to
make
one
suspect
that
,
maybe
,
he
really
could
see
the
true
aspect
of
things
that
appeared
mysterious
or
utterly
hopeless
to
less
imaginative
persons
.
i
wrote
and
wrote
;
i
liquidated
all
the
arrears
of
my
correspondence
,
and
then
went
on
writing
to
people
who
had
no
reason
whatever
to
expect
from
me
a
gossipy
letter
about
nothing
at
all
.
at
times
i
stole
a
sidelong
glance
.
he
was
rooted
to
the
spot
,
but
convulsive
shudders
ran
down
his
back
;
his
shoulders
would
heave
suddenly
.
he
was
fighting
,
he
was
fighting
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
mostly
for
his
breath
,
as
it
seemed
.
the
massive
shadows
,
cast
all
one
way
from
the
straight
flame
of
the
candle
,
seemed
possessed
of
gloomy
consciousness
;
the
immobility
of
the
furniture
had
to
my
furtive
eye
an
air
of
attention
.
i
was
becoming
fanciful
in
the
midst
of
my
industrious
scribbling
;
and
though
,
when
the
scratching
of
my
pen
stopped
for
a
moment
,
there
was
complete
silence
and
stillness
in
the
room
,
i
suffered
from
that
profound
disturbance
and
confusion
of
thought
which
is
caused
by
a
violent
and
menacing
uproar
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
of
a
heavy
gale
at
sea
,
for
instance
.
some
of
you
may
know
what
i
mean
:
that
mingled
anxiety
,
distress
,
and
irritation
with
a
sort
of
craven
feeling
creeping
in
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
not
pleasant
to
acknowledge
,
but
which
gives
a
quite
special
merit
to
one
'
s
endurance
.
i
do
not
claim
any
merit
for
standing
the
stress
of
jim
'
s
emotions
;
i
could
take
refuge
in
the
letters
;
i
could
have
written
to
strangers
if
necessary
.
suddenly
,
as
i
was
taking
up
a
fresh
sheet
of
notepaper
,
i
heard
a
low
sound
,
the
first
sound
that
,
since
we
had
been
shut
up
together
,
had
come
to
my
ears
in
the
dim
stillness
of
the
room
.
i
remained
with
my
head
down
,
with
my
hand
arrested
.
those
who
have
kept
vigil
by
a
sick
-
bed
have
heard
such
faint
sounds
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
watches
,
sounds
wrung
from
a
racked
body
,
from
a
weary
soul
.
he
pushed
the
glass
door
with
such
force
that
all
the
panes
rang
:
he
stepped
out
,
and
i
held
my
breath
,
straining
my
ears
without
knowing
what
else
i
expected
to
hear
.
he
was
really
taking
too
much
to
heart
an
empty
formality
which
to
chester
'
s
rigorous
criticism
seemed
unworthy
the
notice
of
a
man
who
could
see
things
as
they
were
.
an
empty
formality
;
a
piece
of
parchment
.
well
,
well
.
as
to
an
inaccessible
guano
deposit
,
that
was
another
story
altogether
.
one
could
intelligibly
break
one
'
s
heart
over
that
.
a
feeble
burst
of
many
voices
mingled
with
the
tinkle
of
silver
and
glass
floated
up
from
the
dining
-
room
below
;
through
the
open
door
the
outer
edge
of
the
light
from
my
candle
fell
on
his
back
faintly
;
beyond
all
was
black
;
he
stood
on
the
brink
of
a
vast
obscurity
,
like
a
lonely
figure
by
the
shore
of
a
sombre
and
hopeless
ocean
.
there
was
the
walpole
reef
in
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
be
sure
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
speck
in
the
dark
void
,
a
straw
for
the
drowning
man
.
my
compassion
for
him
took
the
shape
of
the
thought
that
i
would
not
have
liked
his
people
to
see
him
at
that
moment
.
i
found
it
trying
myself
.
his
back
was
no
longer
shaken
by
his
gasps
;
he
stood
straight
as
an
arrow
,
faintly
visible
and
still
;
and
the
meaning
of
this
stillness
sank
to
the
bottom
of
my
soul
like
lead
into
the
water
,
and
made
it
so
heavy
that
for
a
second
i
wished
heartily
that
the
only
course
left
open
for
me
was
to
pay
for
his
funeral
.
even
the
law
had
done
with
him
.
to
bury
him
would
have
been
such
an
easy
kindness
!
it
would
have
been
so
much
in
accordance
with
the
wisdom
of
life
,
which
consists
in
putting
out
of
sight
all
the
reminders
of
our
folly
,
of
our
weakness
,
of
our
mortality
;
all
that
makes
against
our
efficiency
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
memory
of
our
failures
,
the
hints
of
our
undying
fears
,
the
bodies
of
our
dead
friends
.
perhaps
he
did
take
it
too
much
to
heart
.
and
if
so
then
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
chester
'
s
offer
.
.
.
.
at
this
point
i
took
up
a
fresh
sheet
and
began
to
write
resolutely
.
there
was
nothing
but
myself
between
him
and
the
dark
ocean
.
i
had
a
sense
of
responsibility
.
if
i
spoke
,
would
that
motionless
and
suffering
youth
leap
into
the
obscurity
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
clutch
at
the
straw
?
i
found
out
how
difficult
it
may
be
sometimes
to
make
a
sound
.
there
is
a
weird
power
in
a
spoken
word
.
and
why
the
devil
not
?
i
was
asking
myself
persistently
while
i
drove
on
with
my
writing
.
all
at
once
,
on
the
blank
page
,
under
the
very
point
of
the
pen
,
the
two
figures
of
chester
and
his
antique
partner
,
very
distinct
and
complete
,
would
dodge
into
view
with
stride
and
gestures
,
as
if
reproduced
in
the
field
of
some
optical
toy
.
i
would
watch
them
for
a
while
.
no
!
they
were
too
phantasmal
and
extravagant
to
enter
into
any
one
'
s
fate
.
and
a
word
carries
far
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
very
far
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
deals
destruction
through
time
as
the
bullets
go
flying
through
space
.
i
said
nothing
;
and
he
,
out
there
with
his
back
to
the
light
,
as
if
bound
and
gagged
by
all
the
invisible
foes
of
man
,
made
no
stir
and
made
no
sound
.
'
'
the
time
was
coming
when
i
should
see
him
loved
,
trusted
,
admired
,
with
a
legend
of
strength
and
prowess
forming
round
his
name
as
though
he
had
been
the
stuff
of
a
hero
.
it
is
true
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
assure
you
;
as
true
as
i
am
sitting
here
talking
about
him
in
vain
.
he
,
on
his
side
,
had
that
faculty
of
beholding
at
a
hint
the
face
of
his
desire
and
the
shape
of
his
dream
,
without
which
the
earth
would
know
no
lover
and
no
adventurer
.
he
captured
much
honour
and
an
arcadian
happiness
(
i
wo
not
say
anything
about
innocence
)
in
the
bush
,
and
it
was
as
good
to
him
as
the
honour
and
the
arcadian
happiness
of
the
streets
to
another
man
.
felicity
,
felicity

how
shall
i
say
it
?

is
quaffed
out
of
a
golden
cup
in
every
latitude
:
the
flavour
is
with
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
with
you
alone
,
and
you
can
make
it
as
intoxicating
as
you
please
.
he
was
of
the
sort
that
would
drink
deep
,
as
you
may
guess
from
what
went
before
.
i
found
him
,
if
not
exactly
intoxicated
,
then
at
least
flushed
with
the
elixir
at
his
lips
.
he
had
not
obtained
it
at
once
.
there
had
been
,
as
you
know
,
a
period
of
probation
amongst
infernal
ship
-
chandlers
,
during
which
he
had
suffered
and
i
had
worried
about
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
about
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
my
trust
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
may
call
it
.
i
do
not
know
that
i
am
completely
reassured
now
,
after
beholding
him
in
all
his
brilliance
.
that
was
my
last
view
of
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
a
strong
light
,
dominating
,
and
yet
in
complete
accord
with
his
surroundings
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
with
the
life
of
the
forests
and
with
the
life
of
men
.
i
own
that
i
was
impressed
,
but
i
must
admit
to
myself
that
after
all
this
is
not
the
lasting
impression
.
he
was
protected
by
his
isolation
,
alone
of
his
own
superior
kind
,
in
close
touch
with
nature
,
that
keeps
faith
on
such
easy
terms
with
her
lovers
.
but
i
cannot
fix
before
my
eye
the
image
of
his
safety
.
i
shall
always
remember
him
as
seen
through
the
open
door
of
my
room
,
taking
,
perhaps
,
too
much
to
heart
the
mere
consequences
of
his
failure
.
i
am
pleased
,
of
course
,
that
some
good
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
even
some
splendour
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
came
out
of
my
endeavours
;
but
at
times
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
been
better
for
my
peace
of
mind
if
i
had
not
stood
between
him
and
chester
'
s
confoundedly
generous
offer
.
i
wonder
what
his
exuberant
imagination
would
have
made
of
walpole
islet
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
most
hopelessly
forsaken
crumb
of
dry
land
on
the
face
of
the
waters
.
it
is
not
likely
i
would
ever
have
heard
,
for
i
must
tell
you
that
chester
,
after
calling
at
some
australian
port
to
patch
up
his
brig
-
rigged
sea
-
anachronism
,
steamed
out
into
the
pacific
with
a
crew
of
twenty
-
two
hands
all
told
,
and
the
only
news
having
a
possible
bearing
upon
the
mystery
of
his
fate
was
the
news
of
a
hurricane
which
is
supposed
to
have
swept
in
its
course
over
the
walpole
shoals
,
a
month
or
so
afterwards
.
not
a
vestige
of
the
argonauts
ever
turned
up
;
not
a
sound
came
out
of
the
waste
.
finis
!
the
pacific
is
the
most
discreet
of
live
,
hot
-
tempered
oceans
:
the
chilly
antarctic
can
keep
a
secret
too
,
but
more
in
the
manner
of
a
grave
.
'
and
there
is
a
sense
of
blessed
finality
in
such
discretion
,
which
is
what
we
all
more
or
less
sincerely
are
ready
to
admit
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
what
else
is
it
that
makes
the
idea
of
death
supportable
?
end
!
finis
!
the
potent
word
that
exorcises
from
the
house
of
life
the
haunting
shadow
of
fate
.
this
is
what
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
notwithstanding
the
testimony
of
my
eyes
and
his
own
earnest
assurances
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
miss
when
i
look
back
upon
jim
'
s
success
.
while
there
'
s
life
there
is
hope
,
truly
;
but
there
is
fear
too
.
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
i
regret
my
action
,
nor
will
i
pretend
that
i
ca
not
sleep
o
'
nights
in
consequence
;
still
,
the
idea
obtrudes
itself
that
he
made
so
much
of
his
disgrace
while
it
is
the
guilt
alone
that
matters
.
he
was
not
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
if
i
may
say
so
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
clear
to
me
.
he
was
not
clear
.
and
there
is
a
suspicion
he
was
not
clear
to
himself
either
.
there
were
his
fine
sensibilities
,
his
fine
feelings
,
his
fine
longings
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
sort
of
sublimated
,
idealised
selfishness
.
he
was
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
if
you
allow
me
to
say
so
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
very
fine
;
very
fine
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
very
unfortunate
.
a
little
coarser
nature
would
not
have
borne
the
strain
;
it
would
have
had
to
come
to
terms
with
itself
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
with
a
sigh
,
with
a
grunt
,
or
even
with
a
guffaw
;
a
still
coarser
one
would
have
remained
invulnerably
ignorant
and
completely
uninteresting
.
'
but
he
was
too
interesting
or
too
unfortunate
to
be
thrown
to
the
dogs
,
or
even
to
chester
.
i
felt
this
while
i
sat
with
my
face
over
the
paper
and
he
fought
and
gasped
,
struggling
for
his
breath
in
that
terribly
stealthy
way
,
in
my
room
;
i
felt
it
when
he
rushed
out
on
the
verandah
as
if
to
fling
himself
over
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
didn
'
t
;
i
felt
it
more
and
more
all
the
time
he
remained
outside
,
faintly
lighted
on
the
background
of
night
,
as
if
standing
on
the
shore
of
a
sombre
and
hopeless
sea
.
'
an
abrupt
heavy
rumble
made
me
lift
my
head
.
the
noise
seemed
to
roll
away
,
and
suddenly
a
searching
and
violent
glare
fell
on
the
blind
face
of
the
night
.
the
sustained
and
dazzling
flickers
seemed
to
last
for
an
unconscionable
time
.
the
growl
of
the
thunder
increased
steadily
while
i
looked
at
him
,
distinct
and
black
,
planted
solidly
upon
the
shores
of
a
sea
of
light
.
at
the
moment
of
greatest
brilliance
the
darkness
leaped
back
with
a
culminating
crash
,
and
he
vanished
before
my
dazzled
eyes
as
utterly
as
though
he
had
been
blown
to
atoms
.
a
blustering
sigh
passed
;
furious
hands
seemed
to
tear
at
the
shrubs
,
shake
the
tops
of
the
trees
below
,
slam
doors
,
break
window
-
panes
,
all
along
the
front
of
the
building
.
he
stepped
in
,
closing
the
door
behind
him
,
and
found
me
bending
over
the
table
:
my
sudden
anxiety
as
to
what
he
would
say
was
very
great
,
and
akin
to
a
fright
.
may
i
have
a
cigarette
?
"
he
asked
.
i
gave
a
push
to
the
box
without
raising
my
head
.
i
want

.
.
.
.

.

.
.

.
.
tobacco
,
"
he
muttered
.
i
became
extremely
buoyant
.
just
a
moment
.
"
i
grunted
pleasantly
.
he
took
a
few
steps
here
and
there
.
that
'
s
over
,
"
i
heard
him
say
.
a
single
distant
clap
of
thunder
came
from
the
sea
like
a
gun
of
distress
.
the
monsoon
breaks
up
early
this
year
,
"
he
remarked
conversationally
,
somewhere
behind
me
.
this
encouraged
me
to
turn
round
,
which
i
did
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
addressing
the
last
envelope
.
he
was
smoking
greedily
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
though
he
heard
the
stir
i
made
,
he
remained
with
his
back
to
me
for
a
time
.
come
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
carried
it
off
pretty
well
,
"
he
said
,
wheeling
suddenly
.
something
'
s
paid
off
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
not
much
.
i
wonder
what
'
s
to
come
.
"
his
face
did
not
show
any
emotion
,
only
it
appeared
a
little
darkened
and
swollen
,
as
though
he
had
been
holding
his
breath
.
he
smiled
reluctantly
as
it
were
,
and
went
on
while
i
gazed
up
at
him
mutely
.
.
.
.
thank
you
,
though
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
your
room

.

.
jolly
convenient
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
a
chap
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
badly
hipped
.
"
the
rain
pattered
and
swished
in
the
garden
;
a
water
-
pipe
(
it
must
have
had
a
hole
in
it
)
performed
just
outside
the
window
a
parody
of
blubbering
woe
with
funny
sobs
and
gurgling
lamentations
,
interrupted
by
jerky
spasms
of
silence
.
.
.
.
a
bit
of
shelter
,
"
he
mumbled
and
ceased
.
'
a
flash
of
faded
lightning
darted
in
through
the
black
framework
of
the
windows
and
ebbed
out
without
any
noise
.
i
was
thinking
how
i
had
best
approach
him
(
i
did
not
want
to
be
flung
off
again
)
when
he
gave
a
little
laugh
.
no
better
than
a
vagabond
now
"
.
.
.
the
end
of
the
cigarette
smouldered
between
his
fingers
.
.
.
without
a
single
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
single
,
"
he
pronounced
slowly
;
"
and
yet
.
.
.
he
paused
;
the
rain
fell
with
redoubled
violence
.
some
day
one
'
s
bound
to
come
upon
some
sort
of
chance
to
get
it
all
back
again
.
must
!
"
he
whispered
distinctly
,
glaring
at
my
boots
.
'
i
did
not
even
know
what
it
was
he
wished
so
much
to
regain
,
what
it
was
he
had
so
terribly
missed
.
it
might
have
been
so
much
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
.
a
piece
of
ass
'
s
skin
,
according
to
chester
.
.
.
.
he
looked
up
at
me
inquisitively
.
perhaps
.
if
life
'
s
long
enough
,
"
i
muttered
through
my
teeth
with
unreasonable
animosity
.
do
not
reckon
too
much
on
it
.
"
"
jove
!
i
feel
as
if
nothing
could
ever
touch
me
,
"
he
said
in
a
tone
of
sombre
conviction
.
if
this
business
could
not
knock
me
over
,
then
there
'
s
no
fear
of
there
being
not
enough
time
to
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
climb
out
,
and
.
.
.
he
looked
upwards
.
'
it
struck
me
that
it
is
from
such
as
he
that
the
great
army
of
waifs
and
strays
is
recruited
,
the
army
that
marches
down
,
down
into
all
the
gutters
of
the
earth
.
as
soon
as
he
left
my
room
,
that
"
bit
of
shelter
,
"
he
would
take
his
place
in
the
ranks
,
and
begin
the
journey
towards
the
bottomless
pit
.
i
at
least
had
no
illusions
;
but
it
was
i
,
too
,
who
a
moment
ago
had
been
so
sure
of
the
power
of
words
,
and
now
was
afraid
to
speak
,
in
the
same
way
one
dares
not
move
for
fear
of
losing
a
slippery
hold
.
it
is
when
we
try
to
grapple
with
another
man
'
s
intimate
need
that
we
perceive
how
incomprehensible
,
wavering
,
and
misty
are
the
beings
that
share
with
us
the
sight
of
the
stars
and
the
warmth
of
the
sun
.
it
is
as
if
loneliness
were
a
hard
and
absolute
condition
of
existence
;
the
envelope
of
flesh
and
blood
on
which
our
eyes
are
fixed
melts
before
the
outstretched
hand
,
and
there
remains
only
the
capricious
,
unconsolable
,
and
elusive
spirit
that
no
eye
can
follow
,
no
hand
can
grasp
.
it
was
the
fear
of
losing
him
that
kept
me
silent
,
for
it
was
borne
upon
me
suddenly
and
with
unaccountable
force
that
should
i
let
him
slip
away
into
the
darkness
i
would
never
forgive
myself
.
"

like

said

smile

.
.

enough

he
looked
at
me
menacingly
.

'

business

"
he
said
.
an
air
of
indomitable
resolution
came
and
went
upon
his
face
like
a
vain
and
passing
shadow
.
next
moment
he
looked
a
dear
good
boy
in
trouble
,
as
before
.
he
flung
away
the
cigarette
.
good
-
bye
,
"
he
said
,
with
the
sudden
haste
of
a
man
who
had
lingered
too
long
in
view
of
a
pressing
bit
of
work
waiting
for
him
;
and
then
for
a
second
or
so
he
made
not
the
slightest
movement
.
the
downpour
fell
with
the
heavy
uninterrupted
rush
of
a
sweeping
flood
,
with
a
sound
of
unchecked
overwhelming
fury
that
called
to
one
'
s
mind
the
images
of
collapsing
bridges
,
of
uprooted
trees
,
of
undermined
mountains
.
no
man
could
breast
the
colossal
and
headlong
stream
that
seemed
to
break
and
swirl
against
the
dim
stillness
in
which
we
were
precariously
sheltered
as
if
on
an
island
.
the
perforated
pipe
gurgled
,
choked
,
spat
,
and
splashed
in
odious
ridicule
of
a
swimmer
fighting
for
his
life
.
it
is
raining
,
"
i
remonstrated
,
"
and

"
rain
or

,
"
he
began
brusquely
,
checked
himself
,
and
walked
to
the
window
.
perfect
deluge
,
"
he
muttered
after
a
while
:
he
leaned
his
forehead
on
the
glass
.
it
is
dark
,
too
.
"
yes
,
it
is
very
dark
,
"
i
said
.
'
he
pivoted
on
his
heels
,
crossed
the
room
,
and
had
actually
opened
the
door
leading
into
the
corridor
before
i
leaped
up
from
my
chair
.
wait
,
"
i
cried
,
"
i
want
you
to
.
.
.
"
i
ca
not
dine
with
you
again
to
-
night
,
"
he
flung
at
me
,
with
one
leg
out
of
the
room
already
.
i
have
not
the
slightest
intention
to
ask
you
,
"
i
shouted
.
at
this
he
drew
back
his
foot
,
but
remained
mistrustfully
in
the
very
doorway
.
i
lost
no
time
in
entreating
him
earnestly
not
to
be
absurd
;
to
come
in
and
shut
the
door
.
'
'
he
came
in
at
last
;
but
i
believe
it
was
mostly
the
rain
that
did
it
;
it
was
falling
just
then
with
a
devastating
violence
which
quieted
down
gradually
while
we
talked
.
his
manner
was
very
sober
and
set
;
his
bearing
was
that
of
a
naturally
taciturn
man
possessed
by
an
idea
.
my
talk
was
of
the
material
aspect
of
his
position
;
it
had
the
sole
aim
of
saving
him
from
the
degradation
,
ruin
,
and
despair
that
out
there
close
so
swiftly
upon
a
friendless
,
homeless
man
;
i
pleaded
with
him
to
accept
my
help
;
i
argued
reasonably
:
and
every
time
i
looked
up
at
that
absorbed
smooth
face
,
so
grave
and
youthful
,
i
had
a
disturbing
sense
of
being
no
help
but
rather
an
obstacle
to
some
mysterious
,
inexplicable
,
impalpable
striving
of
his
wounded
spirit
.
i
suppose
you
intend
to
eat
and
drink
and
to
sleep
under
shelter
in
the
usual
way
,
"
i
remember
saying
with
irritation
.
you
say
you
wo
not
touch
the
money
that
is
due
to
you
.
"
.
.
.
he
came
as
near
as
his
sort
can
to
making
a
gesture
of
horror
.
(
there
were
three
weeks
and
five
days
'
pay
owing
him
as
mate
of
the
patna
.
)
"
well
,
that
'
s
too
little
to
matter
anyhow
;
but
what
will
you
do
to
-
morrow
?
where
will
you
turn
?
you
must
live
.
.
.
"
that
is
not
the
thing
,
"
was
the
comment
that
escaped
him
under
his
breath
.
i
ignored
it
,
and
went
on
combating
what
i
assumed
to
be
the
scruples
of
an
exaggerated
delicacy
.
on
every
conceivable
ground
,
"
i
concluded
,
"
you
must
let
me
help
you
.
"
"
you
can
'
t
,
"
he
said
very
simply
and
gently
,
and
holding
fast
to
some
deep
idea
which
i
could
detect
shimmering
like
a
pool
of
water
in
the
dark
,
but
which
i
despaired
of
ever
approaching
near
enough
to
fathom
.
i
surveyed
his
well
-
proportioned
bulk
.
at
any
rate
,
"
i
said
,
"
i
am
able
to
help
what
i
can
see
of
you
.
i
do
not
pretend
to
do
more
.
"
he
shook
his
head
sceptically
without
looking
at
me
.
i
got
very
warm
.
but
i
can
,
"
i
insisted
.
i
can
do
even
more
.
i
am
doing
more
.
i
am
trusting
you
.
.
.
"
the
money
.
.
.
he
began
.
upon
my
word
you
deserve
being
told
to
go
to
the
devil
,
"
i
cried
,
forcing
the
note
of
indignation
.
he
was
startled
,
smiled
,
and
i
pressed
my
attack
home
.
it
is
not
a
question
of
money
at
all
.
you
are
too
superficial
,
"
i
said
(
and
at
the
same
time
i
was
thinking
to
myself
:
well
,
here
goes
!
and
perhaps
he
is
,
after
all
)
.
look
at
the
letter
i
want
you
to
take
.
i
am
writing
to
a
man
of
whom
i
'
ve
never
asked
a
favour
,
and
i
am
writing
about
you
in
terms
that
one
only
ventures
to
use
when
speaking
of
an
intimate
friend
.
i
make
myself
unreservedly
responsible
for
you
.
that
'
s
what
i
am
doing
.
and
really
if
you
will
only
reflect
a
little
what
that
means
.
.
.
'
he
lifted
his
head
.
the
rain
had
passed
away
;
only
the
water
-
pipe
went
on
shedding
tears
with
an
absurd
drip
,
drip
outside
the
window
.
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
room
,
whose
shadows
huddled
together
in
corners
,
away
from
the
still
flame
of
the
candle
flaring
upright
in
the
shape
of
a
dagger
;
his
face
after
a
while
seemed
suffused
by
a
reflection
of
a
soft
light
as
if
the
dawn
had
broken
already
.
jove
!
"
he
gasped
out
.
it
is
noble
of
you
!
"
'
had
he
suddenly
put
out
his
tongue
at
me
in
derision
,
i
could
not
have
felt
more
humiliated
.
i
thought
to
myself
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
serve
me
right
for
a
sneaking
humbug
.
.
.
.
his
eyes
shone
straight
into
my
face
,
but
i
perceived
it
was
not
a
mocking
brightness
.
all
at
once
he
sprang
into
jerky
agitation
,
like
one
of
those
flat
wooden
figures
that
are
worked
by
a
string
.
his
arms
went
up
,
then
came
down
with
a
slap
.
he
became
another
man
altogether
.
and
i
had
never
seen
,
"
he
shouted
;
then
suddenly
bit
his
lip
and
frowned
.
what
a
bally
ass
i
'
ve
been
,
"
he
said
very
slow
in
an
awed
tone
.
.
.
.
you
are
a
brick
!
he
cried
next
in
a
muffled
voice
.
he
snatched
my
hand
as
though
he
had
just
then
seen
it
for
the
first
time
,
and
dropped
it
at
once
.
why
!
this
is
what
i
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
.
.
he
stammered
,
and
then
with
a
return
of
his
old
stolid
,
i
may
say
mulish
,
manner
he
began
heavily
,
"
i
would
be
a
brute
now
if
i
.
.
and
then
his
voice
seemed
to
break
.
that
'
s
all
right
,
"
i
said
.
i
was
almost
alarmed
by
this
display
of
feeling
,
through
which
pierced
a
strange
elation
.
i
had
pulled
the
string
accidentally
,
as
it
were
;
i
did
not
fully
understand
the
working
of
the
toy
.
i
must
go
now
,
"
he
said
.
jove
!
you
_
have
_
helped
me
.
ca
not
sit
still
.
the
very
thing
.
.
.
he
looked
at
me
with
puzzled
admiration
.
the
very
thing
'
of
course
it
was
the
thing
.
it
was
ten
to
one
that
i
had
saved
him
from
starvation
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
of
that
peculiar
sort
that
is
almost
invariably
associated
with
drink
.
this
was
all
.
i
had
not
a
single
illusion
on
that
score
,
but
looking
at
him
,
i
allowed
myself
to
wonder
at
the
nature
of
the
one
he
had
,
within
the
last
three
minutes
,
so
evidently
taken
into
his
bosom
.
i
had
forced
into
his
hand
the
means
to
carry
on
decently
the
serious
business
of
life
,
to
get
food
,
drink
,
and
shelter
of
the
customary
kind
while
his
wounded
spirit
,
like
a
bird
with
a
broken
wing
,
might
hop
and
flutter
into
some
hole
to
die
quietly
of
inanition
there
.
this
is
what
i
had
thrust
upon
him
:
a
definitely
small
thing
;
and
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
behold
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
by
the
manner
of
its
reception
it
loomed
in
the
dim
light
of
the
candle
like
a
big
,
indistinct
,
perhaps
a
dangerous
shadow
.
you
do
not
mind
me
not
saying
anything
appropriate
,
"
he
burst
out
.
there
is
not
anything
one
could
say
.
last
night
already
you
had
done
me
no
end
of
good
.
listening
to
me
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
know
.
i
give
you
my
word
i
'
ve
thought
more
than
once
the
top
of
my
head
would
fly
off
.
.
.
he
darted
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
positively
darted
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
here
and
there
,
rammed
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
jerked
them
out
again
,
flung
his
cap
on
his
head
.
i
had
no
idea
it
was
in
him
to
be
so
airily
brisk
.
i
thought
of
a
dry
leaf
imprisoned
in
an
eddy
of
wind
,
while
a
mysterious
apprehension
,
a
load
of
indefinite
doubt
,
weighed
me
down
in
my
chair
.
he
stood
stock
-
still
,
as
if
struck
motionless
by
a
discovery
.
you
have
given
me
confidence
,
"
he
declared
,
soberly
.
oh
!
for
god
'
s
sake
,
my
dear
fellow
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
don
'
t
!
"
i
entreated
,
as
though
he
had
hurt
me
.
all
right
.
i
will
shut
up
now
and
henceforth
.
ca
not
prevent
me
thinking
though
.
.
.
.
never
mind
!
.
.
.
i
will
show
yet
.
.
.
he
went
to
the
door
in
a
hurry
,
paused
with
his
head
down
,
and
came
back
,
stepping
deliberately
.
i
always
thought
that
if
a
fellow
could
begin
with
a
clean
slate
.
.
.
and
now
you
.
.
.
in
a
measure
.
.
.
yes
.
.
.
clean
slate
.
"
i
waved
my
hand
,
and
he
marched
out
without
looking
back
;
the
sound
of
his
footfalls
died
out
gradually
behind
the
closed
door
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
unhesitating
tread
of
a
man
walking
in
broad
daylight
.
'
but
as
to
me
,
left
alone
with
the
solitary
candle
,
i
remained
strangely
unenlightened
.
i
was
no
longer
young
enough
to
behold
at
every
turn
the
magnificence
that
besets
our
insignificant
footsteps
in
good
and
in
evil
.
i
smiled
to
think
that
,
after
all
,
it
was
yet
he
,
of
us
two
,
who
had
the
light
.
and
i
felt
sad
.
a
clean
slate
,
did
he
say
?
as
if
the
initial
word
of
each
our
destiny
were
not
graven
in
imperishable
characters
upon
the
face
of
a
rock
.
'
'
six
months
afterwards
my
friend
(
he
was
a
cynical
,
more
than
middle
-
aged
bachelor
,
with
a
reputation
for
eccentricity
,
and
owned
a
rice
-
mill
)
wrote
to
me
,
and
judging
,
from
the
warmth
of
my
recommendation
,
that
i
would
like
to
hear
,
enlarged
a
little
upon
jim
'
s
perfections
.
these
were
apparently
of
a
quiet
and
effective
sort
.
not
having
been
able
so
far
to
find
more
in
my
heart
than
a
resigned
toleration
for
any
individual
of
my
kind
,
i
have
lived
till
now
alone
in
a
house
that
even
in
this
steaming
climate
could
be
considered
as
too
big
for
one
man
.
i
have
had
him
to
live
with
me
for
some
time
past
.
it
seems
i
have
not
made
a
mistake
.
"
it
seemed
to
me
on
reading
this
letter
that
my
friend
had
found
in
his
heart
more
than
tolerance
for
jim
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
there
were
the
beginnings
of
active
liking
.
of
course
he
stated
his
grounds
in
a
characteristic
way
.
for
one
thing
,
jim
kept
his
freshness
in
the
climate
.
had
he
been
a
girl
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
my
friend
wrote
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
one
could
have
said
he
was
blooming
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
blooming
modestly
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
like
a
violet
,
not
like
some
of
these
blatant
tropical
flowers
.
he
had
been
in
the
house
for
six
weeks
,
and
had
not
as
yet
attempted
to
slap
him
on
the
back
,
or
address
him
as
"
old
boy
,
"
or
try
to
make
him
feel
a
superannuated
fossil
.
he
had
nothing
of
the
exasperating
young
man
'
s
chatter
.
he
was
good
-
tempered
,
had
not
much
to
say
for
himself
,
was
not
clever
by
any
means
,
thank
goodness
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
wrote
my
friend
.
it
appeared
,
however
,
that
jim
was
clever
enough
to
be
quietly
appreciative
of
his
wit
,
while
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
amused
him
by
his
naiveness
.
the
dew
is
yet
on
him
,
and
since
i
had
the
bright
idea
of
giving
him
a
room
in
the
house
and
having
him
at
meals
i
feel
less
withered
myself
.
the
other
day
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
cross
the
room
with
no
other
purpose
but
to
open
a
door
for
me
;
and
i
felt
more
in
touch
with
mankind
than
i
had
been
for
years
.
ridiculous
,
is
not
it
?
of
course
i
guess
there
is
something
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
some
awful
little
scrape
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
which
you
know
all
about
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
if
i
am
sure
that
it
is
terribly
heinous
,
i
fancy
one
could
manage
to
forgive
it
.
for
my
part
,
i
declare
i
am
unable
to
imagine
him
guilty
of
anything
much
worse
than
robbing
an
orchard
.
is
it
much
worse
?
perhaps
you
ought
to
have
told
me
;
but
it
is
such
a
long
time
since
we
both
turned
saints
that
you
may
have
forgotten
we
,
too
,
had
sinned
in
our
time
?
it
may
be
that
some
day
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
,
and
then
i
shall
expect
to
be
told
.
i
do
not
care
to
question
him
myself
till
i
have
some
idea
what
it
is
.
moreover
,
it
is
too
soon
as
yet
.
let
him
open
the
door
a
few
times
more
for
me
.
.
.
.
thus
my
friend
.
i
was
trebly
pleased
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
at
jim
'
s
shaping
so
well
,
at
the
tone
of
the
letter
,
at
my
own
cleverness
.
evidently
i
had
known
what
i
was
doing
.
i
had
read
characters
aright
,
and
so
on
.
and
what
if
something
unexpected
and
wonderful
were
to
come
of
it
?
that
evening
,
reposing
in
a
deck
-
chair
under
the
shade
of
my
own
poop
awning
(
it
was
in
hong
-
kong
harbour
)
,
i
laid
on
jim
'
s
behalf
the
first
stone
of
a
castle
in
spain
.
'
i
made
a
trip
to
the
northward
,
and
when
i
returned
i
found
another
letter
from
my
friend
waiting
for
me
.
it
was
the
first
envelope
i
tore
open
.
there
are
no
spoons
missing
,
as
far
as
i
know
,
"
ran
the
first
line
;
"
i
have
not
been
interested
enough
to
inquire
.
he
is
gone
,
leaving
on
the
breakfast
-
table
a
formal
little
note
of
apology
,
which
is
either
silly
or
heartless
.
probably
both
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
it
is
all
one
to
me
.
allow
me
to
say
,
lest
you
should
have
some
more
mysterious
young
men
in
reserve
,
that
i
have
shut
up
shop
,
definitely
and
for
ever
.
this
is
the
last
eccentricity
i
shall
be
guilty
of
.
do
not
