once
outside
the
noisy
coffee
-
room
,
along
in
the
dimly
-
lighted
passage
,
marguerite
blakeney
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
.
she
heaved
a
deep
sigh
,
like
one
who
had
long
been
oppressed
with
the
heavy
weight
of
constant
self
-
control
,
and
she
allowed
a
few
tears
to
fall
unheeded
down
her
cheeks
.
outside
the
rain
had
ceased
,
and
through
the
swiftly
passing
clouds
,
the
pale
rays
of
an
after
-
storm
sun
shone
upon
the
beautiful
white
coast
of
kent
and
the
quaint
,
irregular
houses
that
clustered
round
the
admiralty
pier
.
marguerite
blakeney
stepped
on
to
the
porch
and
looked
out
to
sea
.
silhouetted
against
the
ever
-
changing
sky
,
a
graceful
schooner
,
with
white
sails
set
,
was
gently
dancing
in
the
breeze
.
the
day
dream
it
was
,
sir
percy
blakeney
'
s
yacht
,
which
was
ready
to
take
armand
st
.
just
back
to
france
into
the
very
midst
of
that
seething
,
bloody
revolution
which
was
overthrowing
a
monarchy
,
attacking
a
religion
,
destroying
a
society
,
in
order
to
try
and
rebuild
upon
the
ashes
of
tradition
a
new
utopia
,
of
which
a
few
men
dreamed
,
but
which
none
had
the
power
to
establish
.
in
the
distance
two
figures
were
approaching
"
the
fisherman
'
s
rest
"
:
one
,
an
oldish
man
,
with
a
curious
fringe
of
grey
hairs
round
a
rotund
and
massive
chin
,
and
who
walked
with
that
peculiar
rolling
gait
which
invariably
betrays
the
seafaring
man
:
the
other
,
a
young
,
slight
figure
,
neatly
and
becomingly
dressed
in
a
dark
,
many
caped
overcoat
;
he
was
clean
-
shaved
,
and
his
dark
hair
was
taken
well
back
over
a
clear
and
noble
forehead
.
"
armand
!
"
said
marguerite
blakeney
,
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
approaching
from
the
distance
,
and
a
happy
smile
shone
on
her
sweet
face
,
even
through
the
tears
.
a
minute
or
two
later
brother
and
sister
were
locked
in
each
other
'
s
arms
,
while
the
old
skipper
stood
respectfully
on
one
side
.
"
how
much
time
have
we
got
,
briggs
?
"
asked
lady
blakeney
,
"
before
m
.
st
.
just
need
go
on
board
?
"
"
we
ought
to
weigh
anchor
before
half
an
hour
,
your
ladyship
,
"
replied
the
old
man
,
pulling
at
his
grey
forelock
.
linking
her
arm
in
his
,
marguerite
led
her
brother
towards
the
cliffs
.
"
half
an
hour
,
"
she
said
,
looking
wistfully
out
to
sea
,
"
half
an
hour
more
and
you
will
be
far
from
me
,
armand
!
oh
!
i
ca
not
believe
that
you
are
going
,
dear
!
these
last
few
days
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
whilst
percy
has
been
away
,
and
i
'
ve
had
you
all
to
myself
,
have
slipped
by
like
a
dream
.
"
"
i
am
not
going
far
,
sweet
one
,
"
said
the
young
man
gently
,
"
a
narrow
channel
to
cross
-
a
few
miles
of
road
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
can
soon
come
back
.
"
"
nay
,
`
tis
not
the
distance
,
armand
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
that
awful
paris
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
just
now
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
they
had
reached
the
edge
of
the
cliff
.
the
gentle
sea
-
breeze
blew
marguerite
'
s
hair
about
her
face
,
and
sent
the
ends
of
her
soft
lace
fichu
waving
round
her
,
like
a
white
and
supple
snake
.
she
tried
to
pierce
the
distance
far
away
,
beyond
which
lay
the
shores
of
france
:
that
relentless
and
stern
france
which
was
exacting
her
pound
of
flesh
,
the
blood
-
tax
from
the
noblest
of
her
sons
.
"
our
own
beautiful
country
,
marguerite
,
"
said
armand
,
who
seemed
to
have
divined
her
thoughts
.
"
they
are
going
too
far
,
armand
,
"
she
said
vehemently
.
"
you
are
a
republican
,
so
am
i
.
.
.
.
.
.
we
have
the
same
thoughts
,
the
same
enthusiasm
for
liberty
and
equality
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
even
you
must
think
that
they
are
going
too
far
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
hush
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
said
armand
,
instinctively
,
as
he
threw
a
quick
,
apprehensive
glance
around
him
.
"
ah
!
you
see
:
you
do
not
think
yourself
that
it
is
safe
even
to
speak
of
these
things
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
here
in
england
!
"
she
clung
to
him
suddenly
with
strong
,
almost
motherly
,
passion
:
"
do
not
go
,
armand
!
"
she
begged
;
"
do
not
go
back
!
what
should
i
do
if
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
if
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
if
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
her
voice
was
choked
in
sobs
,
her
eyes
,
tender
,
blue
and
loving
,
gazed
appealingly
at
the
young
man
,
who
in
his
turn
looked
steadfastly
into
hers
.
"
you
would
in
any
case
be
my
own
brave
sister
,
"
he
said
gently
,
"
who
would
remember
that
,
when
france
is
in
peril
,
it
is
not
for
her
sons
to
turn
their
backs
on
her
.
"
even
as
he
spoke
,
that
sweet
childlike
smile
crept
back
into
her
face
,
pathetic
in
the
extreme
,
for
it
seemed
drowned
in
tears
.
"
oh
!
armand
!
"
she
said
quaintly
,
"
i
sometimes
wish
you
had
not
so
many
lofty
virtues
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
assure
you
little
sins
are
far
less
dangerous
and
uncomfortable
.
but
you
will
be
prudent
?
"
she
added
earnestly
.
"
as
far
as
possible
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
promise
you
.
"
"
remember
,
dear
,
i
have
only
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
care
for
me
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
nay
,
sweet
one
,
you
have
other
interests
now
.
percy
cares
for
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
a
look
of
strange
wistfulness
crept
into
her
eyes
as
she
murmured
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
he
did
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
once
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
but
surely
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
there
,
there
,
dear
,
do
not
distress
yourself
on
my
account
.
percy
is
very
good
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
nay
!
"
he
interrupted
energetically
,
"
i
will
distress
myself
on
your
account
,
my
margot
.
listen
,
dear
,
i
have
not
spoken
of
these
things
to
you
before
;
something
always
seemed
to
stop
me
when
i
wished
to
question
you
.
but
,
somehow
,
i
feel
as
if
i
could
not
go
away
and
leave
you
now
without
asking
you
one
question
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
need
not
answer
it
if
you
do
not
wish
,
"
he
added
,
as
he
noted
a
sudden
hard
look
,
almost
of
apprehension
,
darting
through
her
eyes
.
"
what
is
it
?
"
she
asked
simply
.
"
does
sir
percy
blakeney
know
that
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
mean
,
does
he
know
the
part
you
played
in
the
arrest
of
the
marquis
de
st
.
cyr
?
"
she
laughed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
mirthless
,
bitter
,
contemptuous
laugh
,
which
was
like
a
jarring
chord
in
the
music
of
her
voice
.
"
that
i
denounced
the
marquis
de
st
.
cyr
,
you
mean
,
to
the
tribunal
that
ultimately
sent
him
and
all
his
family
to
the
guillotine
?
yes
,
he
does
know
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
told
him
after
i
married
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
you
told
him
all
the
circumstances
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
which
so
completely
exonerated
you
from
any
blame
?
"
"
it
was
too
late
to
talk
of
`
circumstances
'
;
he
heard
the
story
from
other
sources
;
my
confession
came
too
tardily
,
it
seems
.
i
could
no
longer
plead
extenuating
circumstances
:
i
could
not
demean
myself
by
trying
to
explain
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
and
?
"
"
and
now
i
have
the
satisfaction
,
armand
,
of
knowing
that
the
biggest
fool
in
england
has
the
most
complete
contempt
for
his
wife
.
"
she
spoke
with
vehement
bitterness
this
time
,
and
armand
st
.
just
,
who
loved
her
so
dearly
,
felt
that
he
had
placed
a
somewhat
clumsy
finger
upon
an
aching
wound
.
"
but
sir
percy
loved
you
,
margot
,
"
he
repeated
gently
.
"
loved
me
?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
well
,
armand
,
i
thought
at
one
time
that
he
did
,
or
i
should
not
have
married
him
.
i
daresay
,
"
she
added
,
speaking
very
rapidly
,
as
if
she
were
about
to
lay
down
a
heavy
burden
,
which
had
oppressed
her
for
months
,
"
i
daresay
that
even
you
thought
-
as
everybody
else
did
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
i
married
sir
percy
because
of
his
wealth
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
i
assure
you
,
dear
,
that
it
was
not
so
.
he
seemed
to
worship
me
with
a
curious
intensity
of
concentrated
passion
,
which
went
straight
to
my
heart
.
i
had
never
loved
any
one
before
,
as
you
know
,
and
i
was
four
-
and
-
twenty
then
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
so
i
naturally
thought
that
it
was
not
in
my
nature
to
love
.
but
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
it
must
be
heavenly
to
be
loved
blindly
,
passionately
,
wholly
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
worshipped
,
in
fact
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
the
very
fact
that
percy
was
slow
and
stupid
was
an
attraction
for
me
,
as
i
thought
he
would
love
me
all
the
more
.
a
clever
man
would
naturally
have
other
interests
,
an
ambitious
man
other
hopes
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
thought
that
a
fool
would
worship
,
and
think
of
nothing
else
.
and
i
was
ready
to
respond
,
armand
;
i
would
have
allowed
myself
to
be
worshipped
,
and
given
infinite
tenderness
in
return
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
she
sighed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
there
was
a
world
of
disillusionment
in
that
sigh
.
armand
st
.
just
had
allowed
her
to
speak
on
without
interruption
:
he
listened
to
her
,
whilst
allowing
his
own
thoughts
to
run
riot
.
it
was
terrible
to
see
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
girl
in
all
but
name
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
still
standing
almost
at
the
threshold
of
her
life
,
yet
bereft
of
hope
,
bereft
of
illusions
,
bereft
of
all
those
golden
and
fantastic
dreams
,
which
should
have
made
her
youth
one
long
,
perpetual
holiday
.
yet
perhaps
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
though
he
loved
his
sister
dearly
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
perhaps
he
understood
:
he
had
studied
men
in
many
countries
,
men
of
all
ages
,
men
of
every
grade
of
social
and
intellectual
status
,
and
inwardly
he
understood
what
marguerite
had
left
unsaid
.
granted
that
percy
blakeney
was
dull
-
witted
,
but
in
his
slow
-
going
mind
,
there
would
still
be
room
for
that
ineradicable
pride
of
a
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
english
gentlemen
.
a
blakeney
had
died
on
bosworth
field
,
another
had
sacrified
life
and
fortune
for
the
sake
of
a
treacherous
stuart
:
and
that
same
pride
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
foolish
and
prejudiced
as
the
republican
armand
would
call
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
must
have
been
stung
to
the
quick
on
hearing
of
the
sin
which
lay
at
lady
blakeney
'
s
door
.
she
had
been
young
,
misguided
,
ill
-
advised
perhaps
.
armand
knew
that
:
her
impulses
and
imprudence
,
knew
it
still
better
;
but
blakeney
was
slow
-
witted
,
he
would
not
listen
to
"
circumstances
,
"
he
only
clung
to
facts
,
and
these
had
shown
him
lady
blakeney
denouncing
a
fellow
man
to
a
tribunal
that
knew
no
pardon
:
and
the
contempt
he
would
feel
for
the
deed
she
had
done
,
however
unwittingly
,
would
kill
that
same
love
in
him
,
in
which
sympathy
and
intellectuality
could
never
had
a
part
.
yet
even
now
,
his
own
sister
puzzled
him
.
life
and
love
have
such
strange
vagaries
.
could
it
be
that
with
the
waning
of
her
husband
'
s
love
,
marguerite
'
s
heart
had
awakened
with
love
for
him
?
strange
extremes
meet
in
love
'
s
pathway
:
this
woman
,
who
had
had
half
intellectual
europe
at
her
feet
,
might
perhaps
have
set
her
affections
on
a
fool
.
marguerite
was
gazing
out
towards
the
sunset
.
armand
could
not
see
her
face
,
but
presently
it
seemed
to
him
that
something
which
glittered
for
a
moment
in
the
golden
evening
light
,
fell
from
her
eyes
onto
her
dainty
fichu
of
lace
.
but
he
could
not
broach
that
subject
with
her
.
he
knew
her
strange
,
passionate
nature
so
well
,
and
knew
that
reserve
which
lurked
behind
her
frank
,
open
ways
.
the
had
always
been
together
,
these
two
,
for
their
parents
had
died
when
armand
was
still
a
youth
,
and
marguerite
but
a
child
.
he
,
some
eight
years
her
senior
,
had
watched
over
her
until
her
marriage
;
had
chaperoned
her
during
those
brilliant
years
spent
in
the
flat
of
the
rue
de
richelieu
,
and
had
seen
her
enter
upon
this
new
life
of
hers
,
here
in
england
,
with
much
sorrow
and
some
foreboding
.
this
was
his
first
visit
to
england
since
her
marriage
,
and
the
few
months
of
separation
had
already
seemed
to
have
built
up
a
slight
,
thin
partition
between
brother
and
sister
;
the
same
deep
,
intense
love
was
still
there
,
on
both
sides
,
but
each
now
seemed
to
have
a
secret
orchard
,
into
which
the
other
dared
not
penetrate
.
there
was
much
armand
st
.
just
could
not
tell
his
sister
;
the
political
aspect
of
the
revolution
in
france
was
changing
almost
every
day
;
she
might
not
understand
how
his
own
views
and
sympathies
might
become
modified
,
even
as
the
excesses
,
committed
by
those
who
had
been
his
friends
,
grew
in
horror
and
in
intensity
.
and
marguerite
could
not
speak
to
her
brother
about
the
secrets
of
her
heart
;
she
hardly
understood
them
herself
,
she
only
knew
that
,
in
the
midst
of
luxury
,
she
felt
lonely
and
unhappy
.
and
now
armand
was
going
away
;
she
feared
for
his
safety
,
she
longed
for
his
presence
.
she
would
not
spoil
these
last
few
sadly
-
sweet
moments
by
speaking
about
herself
.
she
led
him
gently
along
the
cliffs
,
then
down
to
the
beach
;
their
arms
linked
in
one
another
'
s
,
they
had
still
so
much
to
say
that
lay
just
outside
that
secret
orchard
of
theirs
.
the
afternoon
was
rapidly
drawing
to
a
close
;
and
a
long
,
chilly
english
summer
'
s
evening
was
throwing
a
misty
pall
over
the
green
kentish
landscape
.
the
day
dream
had
set
sail
,
and
marguerite
blakeney
stood
alone
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
over
an
hour
,
watching
those
white
sails
,
which
bore
so
swiftly
away
from
her
the
only
being
who
really
cared
for
her
,
whom
she
dared
to
love
,
whom
she
knew
she
could
trust
.
some
little
distance
away
to
her
left
the
lights
from
the
coffee
-
room
of
"
the
fisherman
'
s
rest
"
glittered
yellow
in
the
gathering
mist
;
from
time
to
time
it
seemed
to
her
aching
nerves
as
if
she
could
catch
from
thence
the
sound
of
merry
-
making
and
of
jovial
talk
,
or
even
that
perpetual
,
senseless
laugh
of
her
husband
'
s
,
which
grated
continually
upon
her
sensitive
ears
.
sir
percy
had
had
the
delicacy
to
leave
her
severely
alone
.
she
supposed
that
,
in
his
own
stupid
,
good
-
natured
way
,
he
may
have
understood
that
she
would
wish
to
remain
alone
,
while
those
white
sails
disappeared
into
the
vague
horizon
,
so
many
miles
away
.
he
,
whose
notions
of
propriety
and
decorum
were
supersensitive
,
had
not
suggested
even
that
an
attendant
should
remain
within
call
.
marguerite
was
grateful
to
her
husband
for
all
this
;
she
always
tried
to
be
grateful
to
him
for
his
thoughtfulness
,
which
was
constant
,
and
for
his
generosity
,
which
really
was
boundless
.
she
tried
even
at
times
to
curb
the
sarcastic
,
bitter
thoughts
of
him
,
which
made
her
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
spite
of
herself
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
say
cruel
,
insulting
things
,
which
she
vaguely
hoped
would
wound
him
.
yes
!
she
often
wished
to
wound
him
,
to
make
him
feel
that
she
too
held
him
in
contempt
,
that
she
too
had
forgotten
that
she
had
almost
loved
him
.
loved
that
inane
fop
!
whose
thoughts
seemed
unable
to
soar
beyond
the
tying
of
a
cravat
or
the
new
cut
of
a
coat
.
bah
!
and
yet
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
vague
memories
,
that
were
sweet
and
ardent
and
attuned
to
this
calm
summer
'
s
evening
,
came
wafted
back
to
her
memory
,
on
the
invisible
wings
of
the
light
sea
-
breeze
:
the
tie
when
first
he
worshipped
her
;
he
seemed
so
devoted
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
very
slave
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
there
was
a
certain
latent
intensity
in
that
love
which
had
fascinated
her
.
then
suddenly
that
love
,
that
devotion
,
which
throughout
his
courtship
she
had
looked
upon
as
the
slavish
fidelity
of
a
dog
,
seemed
to
vanish
completely
.
twenty
-
four
hours
after
the
simple
little
ceremony
at
old
st
.
roch
,
she
had
told
him
the
story
of
how
,
inadvertently
,
she
had
spoken
of
certain
matters
connected
with
the
marquis
de
st
.
cyr
before
some
men
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
her
friends
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
who
had
used
this
information
against
the
unfortunate
marquis
,
and
sent
him
and
his
family
to
the
guillotine
.
she
hated
the
marquis
.
years
ago
,
armand
,
her
dear
brother
,
loved
angele
de
st
.
cyr
,
but
st
.
just
was
a
plebeian
,
and
the
marquis
full
of
the
pride
and
arrogant
prejudices
of
his
caste
.
one
day
armand
,
the
respectful
,
timid
lover
,
ventured
on
sending
a
small
poem
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
enthusiastic
,
ardent
,
passionate
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
the
idol
of
his
dreams
.
the
next
night
he
was
waylaid
just
outside
paris
by
the
valets
of
marquis
de
st
.
cyr
,
and
ignominiously
thrashed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
thrashed
like
a
dog
within
an
inch
of
his
life
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
because
he
had
dared
to
raise
his
eyes
to
the
daughter
of
the
aristocrat
.
the
incident
was
one
which
,
in
those
days
,
some
two
years
before
the
great
revolution
,
was
of
almost
daily
occurrence
in
france
;
incidents
of
that
type
,
in
fact
,
led
to
bloody
reprisals
,
which
a
few
years
later
sent
most
of
those
haughty
heads
to
the
guillotine
.
marguerite
remembered
it
all
:
what
her
brother
must
have
suffered
in
his
manhood
and
his
pride
must
have
been
appalling
;
what
she
suffered
through
him
and
with
him
she
never
attempted
even
to
analyse
.
then
the
day
of
retribution
came
.
st
.
cyr
and
his
kin
had
found
their
masters
,
in
those
same
plebeians
whom
they
had
despised
.
armand
and
marguerite
,
both
intellectual
,
thinking
beings
,
adopted
with
the
enthusiasm
of
their
years
the
utopian
doctrines
of
the
revolution
,
while
the
marquis
de
st
.
cyr
and
his
family
fought
inch
by
inch
for
the
retention
of
those
privileges
which
had
placed
them
socially
above
their
fellow
-
men
.
marguerite
,
impulsive
,
thoughtless
,
not
calculating
the
purport
of
her
words
,
still
smarting
under
the
terrible
insult
her
brother
had
suffered
at
the
marquis
'
hands
,
happened
to
hear
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
amongst
her
own
coterie
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
the
st
.
cyrs
were
in
treasonable
correspondence
with
austria
,
hoping
to
obtain
the
emperor
'
s
support
to
quell
the
growing
revolution
in
their
own
country
.
in
those
days
one
denunciation
was
sufficient
:
marguerite
'
s
few
thoughtless
words
anent
the
marquis
de
st
.
cyr
bore
fruit
within
twenty
-
four
hours
.
he
was
arrested
.
his
papers
were
searched
:
letters
from
the
austrian
emperor
,
promising
to
send
troops
against
the
paris
populace
,
were
found
in
his
desk
.
he
was
arraigned
for
treason
against
the
nation
,
and
sent
to
the
guillotine
,
whilst
his
family
,
his
wife
and
his
sons
,
shared
in
this
awful
fate
.
marguerite
,
horrified
at
the
terrible
consequences
of
her
own
thoughtlessness
,
was
powerless
to
save
the
marquis
:
his
own
coterie
,
the
leaders
of
the
revolutionary
movement
,
all
proclaimed
her
as
a
heroine
:
and
when
she
married
sir
percy
blakeney
,
she
did
not
perhaps
altogether
realise
how
severely
he
would
look
upon
the
sin
,
which
she
had
so
inadvertently
committed
,
and
which
still
lay
heavily
upon
her
soul
.
she
made
full
confession
of
it
to
her
husband
,
trusting
his
blind
love
for
her
,
her
boundless
power
over
him
,
to
soon
make
him
forget
what
might
have
sounded
unpleasant
to
an
english
ear
.
certainly
at
the
moment
he
seemed
to
take
it
very
quietly
;
hardly
,
in
fact
,
did
he
appear
to
understand
the
meaning
of
all
she
said
;
but
what
was
more
certain
still
,
was
that
never
after
that
could
she
detect
the
slightest
sign
of
that
love
,
which
she
once
believed
had
been
wholly
hers
.
now
they
had
drifted
quite
apart
,
and
sir
percy
seemed
to
have
laid
aside
his
love
for
her
,
as
he
would
an
ill
-
fitting
glove
.
she
tried
to
rouse
him
by
sharpening
her
ready
wit
against
his
dull
intellect
;
endeavouring
to
excite
his
jealousy
,
if
she
could
not
rouse
his
love
;
tried
to
goad
him
to
self
-
assertion
,
but
all
in
vain
.
he
remained
the
same
,
always
passive
,
drawling
,
sleepy
,
always
courteous
,
invariably
a
gentleman
:
she
had
all
that
the
world
and
a
wealthy
husband
can
give
to
a
pretty
woman
,
yet
on
this
beautiful
summer
'
s
evening
,
with
the
white
sails
of
the
day
dream
finally
hidden
by
the
evening
shadows
,
she
felt
more
lonely
than
that
poor
tramp
who
plodded
his
way
wearily
along
the
rugged
cliffs
.
with
another
heavy
sigh
,
marguerite
blakeney
turned
her
back
upon
the
sea
and
cliffs
,
and
walked
slowly
back
towards
"
the
fisherman
'
s
rest
.
"
as
she
drew
near
,
the
sound
of
revelry
,
of
gay
,
jovial
laughter
,
grew
louder
and
more
distinct
.
she
could
distinguish
sir
andrew
ffoulkes
'
pleasant
voice
,
lord
tony
'
s
boisterous
guffaws
,
her
husband
'
s
occasional
,
drawly
,
sleepy
comments
;
then
realising
the
loneliness
of
the
road
and
the
fast
gathering
gloom
round
her
,
she
quickened
her
steps
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
next
moment
she
perceived
a
stranger
coming
rapidly
towards
her
.
marguerite
did
not
look
up
:
she
was
not
the
least
nervous
,
and
"
the
fisherman
'
s
rest
"
was
now
well
within
call
.
the
stranger
paused
when
he
saw
marguerite
coming
quickly
towards
him
,
and
just
as
she
was
about
to
slip
past
him
,
he
said
very
quietly
:
"
citoyenne
st
.
just
.
"
marguerite
uttered
a
little
cry
of
astonishment
,
at
thus
hearing
her
own
familiar
maiden
name
uttered
so
close
to
her
.
she
looked
up
at
the
stranger
,
and
this
time
,
with
a
cry
of
unfeigned
pleasure
,
she
put
out
both
her
hands
effusively
towards
him
.
"
chauvelin
!
"
she
exclaimed
.
"
himself
,
citoyenne
,
at
your
service
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
gallantly
kissing
the
tips
of
her
fingers
.
marguerite
said
nothing
for
a
moment
or
two
,
as
she
surveyed
with
obvious
delight
the
not
very
prepossessing
little
figure
before
her
.
chauvelin
was
then
nearer
forty
than
thirty
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
clever
,
shrewd
-
looking
personality
,
with
a
curious
fox
-
like
expression
in
the
deep
,
sunken
eyes
.
he
was
the
same
stranger
who
an
hour
or
two
previously
had
joined
mr
jellyband
in
a
friendly
glass
of
wine
.
"
chauvelin
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
my
friend
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
said
marguerite
,
with
a
pretty
little
sigh
of
satisfaction
.
"
i
am
mightily
pleased
to
see
you
.
"
no
doubt
poor
marguerite
st
.
just
,
lonely
in
the
midst
of
her
grandeur
,
and
of
her
starchy
friends
,
was
happy
to
see
a
face
that
brought
back
memories
of
that
happy
time
in
paris
,
when
she
reigned
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
queen
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
over
the
intellectual
coterie
of
the
rue
de
richelieu
.
she
did
not
notice
the
sarcastic
little
smile
,
however
,
that
hovered
round
the
thin
lips
of
chauvelin
.
"
but
tell
me
,
"
she
added
merrily
,
"
what
in
the
world
,
or
whom
in
the
world
,
are
you
doing
here
in
england
?
"
"
i
might
return
the
subtle
compliment
,
fair
lady
,
"
he
said
.
"
what
of
yourself
?
"
"
oh
,
i
?
"
she
said
,
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
.
"
je
m
'
ennuie
,
mon
ami
,
that
is
all
.
"
they
had
reached
the
porch
of
"
the
fisherman
'
s
rest
,
"
but
marguerite
seemed
loth
to
go
within
.
the
evening
air
was
lovely
after
the
storm
,
and
she
had
found
a
friend
who
exhaled
the
breath
of
paris
,
who
knew
armand
well
,
who
could
talk
of
all
the
merry
,
brilliant
friends
whom
she
had
left
behind
.
so
she
lingered
on
under
the
pretty
porch
,
while
through
the
gaily
-
lighted
dormer
-
window
of
the
coffee
-
room
sounds
of
laughter
,
of
calls
for
"
sally
"
and
for
beer
,
of
tapping
of
mugs
,
and
clinking
of
dice
,
mingled
with
sir
percy
blakeney
'
s
inane
and
mirthless
laugh
.
chauvelin
stood
beside
her
,
his
shrewd
,
pale
,
yellow
eyes
fixed
on
the
pretty
face
,
which
looked
so
sweet
and
childlike
in
this
soft
english
summer
twilight
.
"
you
surprise
me
,
citoyenne
,
"
he
said
quietly
,
as
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
"
do
i
now
?
"
she
retorted
gaily
.
"
faith
,
my
little
chauvelin
,
i
should
have
thought
that
,
with
your
penetration
,
you
would
have
guessed
that
an
atmosphere
composed
of
fogs
and
virtues
would
never
suit
marguerite
st
.
just
.
"
"
dear
me
!
is
it
as
bad
as
that
?
"
he
asked
,
in
mock
consternation
.
"
quite
,
"
she
retorted
,
"
and
worse
.
"
"
strange
!
now
,
i
thought
that
a
pretty
woman
would
have
found
english
country
life
peculiarly
attractive
.
"
"
yes
!
so
did
i
,
"
she
said
with
a
sigh
,
"
pretty
women
,
"
she
added
meditatively
,
"
ought
to
have
a
good
time
in
england
,
since
all
the
pleasant
things
are
forbidden
them
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
very
things
they
do
every
day
.
"
"
quite
so
!
"
"
you
will
hardly
believe
it
,
my
little
chauvelin
,
"
she
said
earnestly
,
"
but
i
often
pass
a
whole
day
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
whole
day
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
without
encountering
a
single
temptation
.
"
"
no
wonder
,
"
retorted
chauvelin
,
gallantly
,
"
that
the
cleverest
woman
in
europe
is
troubled
with
ennui
.
"
she
laughed
one
of
her
melodious
,
rippling
,
childlike
laughs
.
"
it
must
be
pretty
bad
,
must
not
it
?
"
she
asked
archly
,
"
or
i
should
not
have
been
so
pleased
to
see
you
.
"
"
and
this
within
a
year
of
a
romantic
love
match
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
'
s
just
the
difficulty
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
ah
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
idyllic
folly
,
"
said
chauvelin
,
with
quiet
sarcasm
,
"
did
not
then
survive
the
lapse
of
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
weeks
?
"
"
idyllic
follies
never
last
,
my
little
chauvelin
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
they
come
upon
us
like
the
measles
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
are
as
easily
cured
.
"
chauvelin
took
another
pinch
of
snuff
:
he
seemed
very
much
addicted
to
that
pernicious
habit
,
so
prevalent
in
those
days
;
perhaps
,
too
,
he
found
the
taking
of
snuff
a
convenient
veil
for
disguising
the
quick
,
shrewd
glances
with
which
he
strove
to
read
the
very
souls
of
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
.
"
no
wonder
,
"
he
repeated
,
with
the
same
gallantry
,
"
that
the
most
active
brain
in
europe
is
troubled
with
ennui
.
"
"
i
was
in
hopes
that
you
had
a
prescription
against
the
malady
,
my
little
chauvelin
.
"
"
how
can
i
hope
to
succeed
in
that
which
sir
percy
blakeney
has
failed
to
accomplish
?
"
"
shall
we
leave
sir
percy
out
of
the
question
for
the
present
,
my
dear
friend
?
she
said
drily
.
"
ah
!
my
dear
lady
,
pardon
me
,
but
that
is
just
what
we
cannot
very
well
do
,
"
said
chauvelin
,
whilst
once
again
his
eyes
,
keen
as
those
of
a
fox
on
the
alert
,
darted
a
quick
glance
at
marguerite
.
"
i
have
a
most
perfect
prescription
against
the
worst
form
of
ennui
,
which
i
would
have
been
happy
to
submit
to
you
,
but
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
but
what
?
"
"
there
is
sir
percy
.
"
"
what
has
he
to
do
with
it
?
"
"
quite
a
good
deal
,
i
am
afraid
.
the
prescription
i
would
offer
,
fair
lady
,
is
called
by
a
very
plebeian
name
:
work
!
"
"
work
?
"
chauvelin
looked
at
marguerite
long
and
scrutinisingly
.
it
seemed
as
if
those
keen
,
pale
eyes
of
his
were
reading
every
one
of
her
thoughts
.
they
were
alone
together
;
the
evening
air
was
quite
still
,
and
their
soft
whispers
were
drowned
in
the
noise
which
came
from
the
coffee
-
room
.
still
,
chauvelin
took
as
step
or
two
from
under
the
porch
,
looked
quickly
and
keenly
all
round
him
,
then
seeing
that
indeed
no
one
was
within
earshot
,
he
once
more
came
back
close
to
marguerite
.
"
will
you
render
france
a
small
service
,
citoyenne
?
"
he
asked
,
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
,
which
lent
his
thin
,
fox
-
like
face
a
singular
earnestness
.
"
la
,
man
!
"
she
replied
flippantly
,
"
how
serious
you
look
all
of
a
sudden
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
indeed
i
do
not
know
if
i
would
render
france
a
small
service
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
at
any
rate
,
it
depends
upon
the
kind
of
service
she
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
or
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
want
.
"
"
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
scarlet
pimpernel
,
citoyenne
st
.
just
?
"
asked
chauvelin
,
abruptly
.
"
heard
of
the
scarlet
pimpernel
?
"
she
retorted
with
a
long
and
merry
laugh
,
"
faith
man
!
we
talk
of
nothing
else
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
we
have
hats

a
la
scarlet
pimpernel

;
our
horses
are
called
`
scarlet
pimpernel
'
;
at
the
prince
of
wales
'
supper
party
the
other
night
we
had
a
`
souffle
a
la
scarlet
pimpernel
.
'
.
.
.
.

lud
!
"
she
added
gaily
,
"
the
other
day
i
ordered
at
my
milliner
'
s
a
blue
dress
trimmed
with
green
,
and
bless
me
,
if
she
did
not
call
that
`
a
la
scarlet
pimpernel
.
'
"
chauvelin
had
not
moved
while
she
prattled
merrily
along
;
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
stop
her
when
her
musical
voice
and
her
childlike
laugh
went
echoing
through
the
still
evening
air
.
but
he
remained
serious
and
earnest
whilst
she
laughed
,
and
his
voice
,
clear
,
incisive
,
and
hard
,
was
not
raised
above
his
breath
as
he
said
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
then
,
as
you
have
heard
of
that
enigmatical
personage
,
citoyenne
,
you
must
also
have
guessed
,
and
know
,
that
the
man
who
hides
his
identity
under
that
strange
pseudonym
,
is
the
most
bitter
enemy
of
our
republic
,
of
france
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
of
men
like
armand
st
.
just

"
"
la
!
.
.
"
she
said
,
with
a
quaint
little
sigh
,
"
i
dare
swear
he
is
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
france
has
many
bitter
enemies
these
days
.
"
"
but
you
,
citoyenne
,
are
a
daughter
of
france
,
and
should
be
ready
to
help
her
in
a
moment
of
deadly
peril
.
"
"
my
brother
armand
devotes
his
life
to
france
,
"
she
retorted
proudly
;
"
as
for
me
,
i
can
do
nothing

"
"
yes

"
he
urged
still
more
earnestly
,
whilst
his
thin
fox
-
like
face
seemed
suddenly
to
have
grown
impressive
and
full
of
dignity
,
"
here

i
have
been
sent
over
here
by
the
republican
government
as
its
representative
:
i
present
my
credentials
to
mr
pitt
in
london
to
-
morrow
.
one
of
my
duties
here
is
to
find
out
all
about
this
league
of
the
scarlet
pimpernel
,
which
has
become
a
standing
menace
to
france
,
since
it
is
pledged
to
help
our
cursed
aristocrats
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
traitors
to
their
country
,
and
enemies
of
the
people
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
escape
from
the
just
punishment
which
they
deserve
.
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
,
citoyenne
,
that
once
they
are
over
here
,
those
french
emigres
try
to
rouse
public
feeling
against
the
republic
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
they
are
ready
to
join
issue
with
any
enemy
bold
enough
to
attack
france
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
now
,
within
the
last
month
scores
of
these
emigres
,
some
only
suspected
of
treason
,
others
actually
condemned
by
the
tribunal
of
public
safety
,
have
succeeded
in
crossing
the
channel
.
their
escape
in
each
instance
was
planned
,
organized
and
effected
by
this
society
of
young
english
jackanapes
,
headed
by
a
man
whose
brain
seems
as
resourceful
as
his
identity
is
mysterious
.
all
the
most
strenuous
efforts
on
the
part
of
my
spies
have
failed
to
discover
who
he
is
;
whilst
the
others
are
the
hands
,
he
is
the
head
,
who
beneath
this
strange
anonymity
calmly
works
at
the
destruction
of
france
.
i
mean
to
strike
at
that
head
,
and
for
this
i
want
your
help
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
through
him
afterwards
i
can
reach
the
rest
of
the
gang
:
he
is
a
young
buck
in
english
society
,
of
that
i
feel
sure
.
find
that
man
for
me
,
citoyenne
!
"
he
urged
,
"
find
him
for
france

"
marguerite
had
listened
to
chauvelin
'
s
impassioned
speech
without
uttering
a
word
,
scarce
making
a
movement
,
hardly
daring
to
breathe
.
she
had
told
him
before
that
this
mysterious
hero
of
romance
was
the
talk
of
the
smart
set
to
which
she
belonged
;
already
,
before
this
,
her
heart
and
her
imagination
had
stirred
by
the
thought
of
the
brave
man
,
who
,
unknown
to
fame
,
had
rescued
hundreds
of
lives
from
a
terrible
,
often
an
unmerciful
fate
.
she
had
but
little
real
sympathy
with
those
haughty
french
aristocrats
,
insolent
in
their
pride
of
caste
,
of
whom
the
comtesse
de
tournay
de
basserive
was
so
typical
an
example
;
but
republican
and
liberal
-
minded
though
she
was
from
principle
,
she
hated
and
loathed
the
methods
which
the
young
republic
had
chosen
for
establishing
itself
.
she
had
not
been
in
paris
for
some
months
;
the
horrors
and
bloodshed
of
the
reign
of
terror
,
culminating
in
the
september
massacres
,
had
only
come
across
the
channel
to
her
as
a
faint
echo
.
robespierre
,
danton
,
marat
,
she
had
not
known
in
their
new
guise
of
bloody
judiciaries
,
merciless
wielders
of
the
guillotine
.
her
very
soul
recoiled
in
horror
from
these
excesses
,
to
which
she
feared
her
brother
armand
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
moderate
republican
as
he
was
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
might
become
one
day
the
holocaust
.
then
,
when
first
she
heard
of
this
band
of
young
english
enthusiasts
,
who
,
for
sheer
love
of
their
fellowmen
,
dragged
women
and
children
,
old
and
young
men
,
from
a
horrible
death
,
her
heart
had
glowed
with
pride
for
them
,
and
now
,
as
chauvelin
spoke
,
her
very
soul
went
out
to
the
gallant
and
mysterious
leader
of
the
reckless
little
band
,
who
risked
his
life
daily
,
who
gave
it
freely
and
without
ostentation
,
for
the
sake
of
humanity
.
her
eyes
were
moist
when
chauvelin
had
finished
speaking
,
the
lace
at
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
with
her
quick
,
excited
breathing
;
she
no
longer
heard
the
noise
of
drinking
from
the
inn
,
she
did
not
heed
her
husband
'
s
voice
or
his
inane
laugh
,
her
thoughts
had
gone
wandering
in
search
of
the
mysterious
hero
!
ah
!
there
was
a
man
she
might
have
loved
,
had
he
come
her
way
:
everything
in
him
appealed
to
her
romantic
imagination
;
his
personality
,
his
strength
,
his
bravery
,
the
loyalty
of
those
who
served
under
him
in
that
same
noble
cause
,
and
,
above
all
,
that
anonymity
which
crowned
him
,
as
if
with
a
halo
of
romantic
glory
.
"
find
him
for
france
,
citoyenne
!
"
chauvelin
'
s
voice
close
to
her
ear
roused
her
from
her
dreams
.
the
mysterious
hero
had
vanished
,
and
,
not
twenty
yards
away
from
her
,
a
man
was
drinking
and
laughing
,
to
whom
she
had
sworn
faith
and
loyalty
.
"
la
!
man
,
"
she
said
with
a
return
of
her
assumed
flippancy
,
"
you
are
astonishing
.
where
in
the
world
am
i
to
look
for
him
?
"
"
you
go
everywhere
,
citoyenne
,
"
whispered
chauvelin
,
insinuatingly
,
"
lady
blakeney
is
the
pivot
of
social
london
,
so
i
am
told
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
see
everything
,
you
hear
everything
.
"
"
easy
,
my
friend
,
"
retorted
marguerite
,
drawing
,
herself
up
to
her
full
height
and
looking
down
,
with
a
slight
thought
of
contempt
on
the
small
,
thin
figure
before
her
.
"
easy
!
you
seem
to
forget
that
there
are
six
feet
of
sir
percy
blakeney
,
and
a
long
line
of
ancestors
to
stand
between
lady
blakeney
and
such
a
thing
as
you
propose
.
"
"
for
the
sake
of
france
,
citoyenne
!
"
reiterated
chauvelin
,
earnestly
.
"
tush
,
man
,
you
talk
nonsense
anyway
;
for
even
if
you
did
know
who
this
scarlet
pimpernel
is
,
you
could
do
nothing
to
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
an
englishman
!
"
"
i
'
d
take
my
chance
of
that
,
"
said
chauvelin
,
with
a
dry
,
rasping
little
laugh
.
"
at
any
rate
we
could
send
him
to
the
guillotine
first
to
cool
his
ardour
,
then
,
when
there
is
a
diplomatic
fuss
about
it
,
we
can
apologise
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
humbly
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
the
british
government
,
and
,
if
necessary
,
pay
compensation
to
the
bereaved
family
.
"
"
what
you
propose
is
horrible
,
chauvelin
,
"
she
said
,
drawing
away
from
him
as
from
some
noisome
insect
.
"
whoever
the
man
may
be
,
he
is
brave
and
noble
,
and
never
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
do
you
hear
me
?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
never
would
i
lend
a
hand
to
such
villainy
.
"
"
you
prefer
to
be
insulted
by
every
french
aristocrat
who
comes
to
this
country
?
"
chauvelin
had
taken
sure
aim
when
he
shot
this
tiny
shaft
.
marguerite
'
s
fresh
young
cheeks
became
a
thought
more
pale
and
she
bit
her
under
lip
,
for
she
would
not
let
him
see
that
the
shaft
had
struck
home
.
"
that
is
beside
the
question
,
"
she
said
at
last
with
indifference
.
"
i
can
defend
myself
,
but
i
refuse
to
do
any
dirty
work
for
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
or
for
france
.
you
have
other
means
at
your
disposal
;
you
must
use
them
,
my
friend
.
"
and
without
another
look
at
chauvelin
,
marguerite
blakeney
turned
her
back
on
him
and
walked
straight
into
the
inn
.
"
that
is
not
your
last
word
,
citoyenne
,
"
said
chauvelin
,
as
a
flood
of
light
from
the
passage
illumined
her
elegant
,
richly
-
clad
figure
,
"
we
meet
in
london
,
i
hope
!
"
"
we
meet
in
london
,
"
she
said
,
speaking
over
her
shoulder
at
him
,
"
but
that
is
my
last
word
.
"
she
threw
open
the
coffee
-
room
door
and
disappeared
from
his
view
,
but
he
remained
under
the
porch
for
a
moment
or
two
,
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
he
had
received
a
rebuke
and
a
snub
,
but
his
shrewd
,
fox
-
like
face
looked
neither
abashed
nor
disappointed
;
on
the
contrary
,
a
curious
smile
,
half
sarcastic
and
wholly
satisfied
,
played
around
the
corners
of
his
thin
lips
.
a
beautiful
starlit
night
had
followed
on
the
day
of
incessant
rain
:
a
cool
,
balmy
,
late
summer
'
s
night
,
essentially
english
in
its
suggestion
of
moisture
and
scent
of
wet
earth
and
dripping
leaves
.
the
magnificent
coach
,
drawn
by
four
of
the
finest
thoroughbreds
in
england
,
had
driven
off
along
the
london
road
,
with
sir
percy
blakeney
on
the
box
,
holding
the
reins
in
his
slender
feminine
hands
,
and
beside
him
lady
blakeney
wrapped
in
costly
furs
.
a
fifty
-
mile
drive
on
a
starlit
summer
'
s
night
!
marguerite
had
hailed
the
notion
of
it
with
delight
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
sir
percy
was
an
enthusiastic
whip
;
his
four
thoroughbreds
,
which
had
been
sent
down
to
dover
a
couple
of
days
before
,
were
just
sufficiently
fresh
and
restive
to
add
zest
to
the
expedition
and
marguerite
revelled
in
anticipation
of
the
few
hours
of
solitude
,
with
the
soft
night
breeze
fanning
her
cheeks
,
her
thoughts
wandering
,
whither
away
?
she
knew
from
old
experience
that
sir
percy
would
speak
little
,
if
at
all
:
he
had
often
driven
her
on
his
beautiful
coach
for
hours
at
night
,
from
point
to
point
,
without
making
more
than
one
or
two
casual
remarks
upon
the
weather
or
the
state
of
the
roads
.
he
was
very
fond
of
driving
by
night
,
and
she
had
very
quickly
adopted
his
fancy
:
as
she
sat
next
to
him
hour
after
hour
,
admiring
the
dexterous
,
certain
way
in
which
he
handled
the
reins
,
she
often
wondered
what
went
on
in
that
slow
-
going
head
of
his
.
he
never
told
her
,
and
she
had
never
cared
to
ask
.

was
going
the
round
,
putting
out
the
lights
.
his
bar
customers
had
all
gone
,
but
upstairs
in
the
snug
little
bedrooms
,
mr
jellyband
had
quite
a
few
important
guests
:
the
comtesse
de
tournay
,
with
suzannne
,
and
the
vicomte
,
and
there
were
two
more
bedrooms
ready
for
sir
andrew
ffoulkes
and
lord
antony
dewhurst
,
if
the
two
young
men
should
elect
to
honour
the
ancient
hostelry
and
stay
the
night
.
for
the
moment
these
two
young
gallants
were
comfortably
installed
in
the
coffee
-
room
,
before
the
huge
log
-
fire
,
which
,
in
spite
of
the
mildness
of
the
evening
,
had
been
allowed
to
burn
merrily
.
"
i
say
,
jelly
,
has
everyone
gone
?
"
asked
lord
tony
,
as
the
worthy
landlord
still
busied
himself
clearing
away
glasses
and
mugs
.
"
everyone
,
as
you
see
,
my
lord
.
"
"
and
all
your
servants
gone
to
bed
?
"
"
all
except
the
boy
on
duty
in
the
bar
,
and
,
"
added
mr
jellyband
with
a
laugh
,
"
i
expect
he
will
be
asleep
afore
long
,
the
rascal
.
"
"
then
we
can
talk
here
undisturbed
for
half
an
hour
?
"
"
at
your
service
,
my
lord
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
will
leave
your
candles
on
the
dresser
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
your
rooms
are
quite
ready
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
sleep
at
the
top
of
the
house
myself
,
but
if
your
lordship
will
only
call
loudly
enough
,
i
daresay
i
shall
hear
.
"
"
all
right
,
jelly
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
say
,
put
the
lamp
out
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
fire
will
give
us
all
the
light
we
need
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
we
do
not
want
to
attract
the
passer
-
by

"
"
al
ri
'
,
my
lord
.
"
mr
jellyband
did
as
he
was
bid
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
turned
out
the
quaint
old
lamp
that
hung
from
the
raftered
ceiling
and
blew
out
all
the
candles
.
"
let
'
s
have
a
bottle
of
wine
,
jelly
,
"
suggested
sir
andrew
.
"
al
ri
'
,
sir
!
"
jellyband
went
off
to
fetch
the
wine
.
the
room
now
was
quite
dark
,
save
for
the
circle
of
ruddy
and
fitful
light
formed
by
the
brightly
blazing
logs
in
the
hearth
.
"
is
that
all
,
gentlemen
?
"
asked
jellyband
,
as
he
returned
with
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
couple
of
glasses
,
which
he
placed
on
the
table
.
"
that
will
do
nicely
,
thanks
,
jelly
!
"
said
lord
tony
.
"
good
-
night
,
my
lord
!
good
-
night
,
sir
!
"
"
good
-
night
,
jelly
!
"
the
two
young
men
listened
,
whilst
the
heavy
tread
of
mr
jellyband
was
heard
echoing
along
the
passage
and
staircase
.
presently
even
that
sound
died
out
,
and
the
whole
of
"
the
fisherman
'
s
rest
"
seemed
wrapt
in
sleep
,
save
the
two
young
men
drinking
in
silence
beside
the
hearth
.
for
a
while
no
sound
was
heard
,
even
in
the
coffee
-
room
,
save
the
ticking
of
the
old
grandfather
'
s
clock
and
the
crackling
of
the
burning
wood
.
"
all
right
again
this
time
,
ffoulkes
?
"
asked
lord
antony
at
last
.
sir
andrew
had
been
dreaming
evidently
,
gazing
into
the
fire
,
and
seeing
therein
,
no
doubt
,
a
pretty
,
piquant
face
,
with
large
brown
eyes
and
a
wealth
of
dark
curls
round
a
childish
forehead
.
"
yes
!
"
he
said
,
still
musing
,
"
all
right
!
"
"
no
hitch
?
"
"
none
.
"
lord
antony
laughed
pleasantly
as
he
poured
himself
out
another
glass
of
wine
.
"
i
need
not
ask
,
i
suppose
,
whether
you
found
the
journey
pleasant
this
time
?
"
"
no
,
friend
,
you
need
not
ask
,
"
replied
sir
andrew
,
gaily
.
"
it
was
all
right
.
"
"
then
here
'
s
to
her
very
good
health
,
"
said
jovial
lord
tony
.
"
she
is
a
bonnie
lass
,
though
she
is
a
french
one
.
and
here
'
s
to
your
courtship
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
may
it
flourish
and
prosper
exceedingly
.
"
he
drained
his
glass
to
the
last
drop
,
then
joined
his
friend
beside
the
hearth
.
"
well
!
you
will
be
doing
the
journey
next
,
tony
,
i
expect
,
"
said
sir
andrew
,
rousing
himself
from
his
meditations
,
"
you
and
hastings
,
certainly
;
and
i
hope
you
may
have
as
pleasant
a
task
as
i
had
,
and
as
charming
a
travelling
companion

you

no

tony

.
.
.
.

"
"
no
!
i

,
"
interrupted
his
friend
pleasantly
,
"
but
i
will
take
your
word
for
it
.
and
now
,
"
he
added
,
whilst
a
sudden
earnestness
crept
over
his
jovial
young
face
,
"
how
about
business
?
"
the
two
young
men
drew
their
chairs
closer
together
,
and
instinctively
,
though
they
were
alone
,
their
voices
sank
to
a
whisper
.
"
i
saw
the
scarlet
pimpernel
alone
,
for
a
few
moments
in
calais
,
"
said
sir
andrew
,
"
a
day
or
two
ago
.
he
crossed
over
to
england
two
days
before
we
did
.
he
had
escorted
the
party
all
the
way
from
paris
,
dressed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
will
never
credit
it
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
an
old
market
woman
,
and
driving
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
until
they
were
safely
out
of
the
city

.
.
.

.
.
the
covered
cart
,
under
which
the
comtesse
de
tournay
,
mlle
.
suzanne
,
and
the
vicomte
lay
concealed
among
the
turnips
and
cabbages
.
they
,
themselves
,
of
course
,
never
suspected
who
their
driver
was
.
he
drove
them
right
through
a
line
of
soldiery
and
a
yelling
mob
,
who
were
screaming
,
`
a
bas
les
aristos
!
'
but
the
market
cart
got
through
along
with
some
others
,
and
the
scarlet
pimpernel
,
in
shawl
,
petticoat
and
hood
,
yelled
`
a
bas
les
aristos
!
'
louder
than
anybody

faith
!
"
added
the
young
man
,
as
his
eyes
glowed
with
enthusiasm
for
the
beloved
leader
,
"
that
man
'
s
a
marvel
!
his
cheek
is
preposterous
,
i
vow
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
that
'
s
what
carries
him
through
.
"
lord
antony
,
whose
vocabulary
was
more
limited
than
that
of
his
friend
,
could
only
find
an
oath
or
two
with
which
to
show
his
admiration
for
his
leader
.
"
he
wants
you
and
hastings
to
meet
him
at
calais

"
said
sir
andrew
,
more
quietly
,
"
on
the
2nd
of
next
month

let
me
see
!
that
will
be
next
wednesday
.
"
"
yes
.
"
"
it
is
,
of
course
,
the
case
of
the
comte
de
tournay
,
this
time
;
a
dangerous
task
,
for
the
comte
,
whose
escape
from
his
chateau
,
after
he
had
been
declared
a
`
suspect
'
by
the
committee
of
public
safety
,
was
a
masterpiece
of
the
scarlet
pimpernel
'
s
ingenuity
,
is
now
under
sentence
of
death
.
it
will
be
rare
sport
to
get
him
out
of
france
,
and
you
will
have
a
narrow
escape
,
if
you
get
through
at
all

st

just
has
actually
gone
to
meet
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
of
course
,
no
one
suspects
st
.
just
as
yet
;
but
after
that
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
get
them
both
out
of
the
country
!
i
'
faith
,
`
twill
be
a
tough
job
,
and
tax
even
the
ingenuity
of
our
chief
.
i
hope
i
may
yet
have
orders
to
be
of
the
party
.
"
"
have
you
any
special
instructions
for
me
?
"
"
yes
!
rather
more
precise
ones
than
usual
.
it
appears
that
the
republican
government
have
sent
an
accredited
agent
over
to
england
,
a
man
named
chauvelin
,
who
is
said
to
be
terribly
bitter
against
our
league
,
and
determined
to
discover
the
identity
of
our
leader
,
so
that
he
may
have
him
kidnapped
,
the
next
time
he
attempts
to
set
foot
in
france
.
this
chauvelin
has
brought
a
whole
army
of
spies
with
him
,
and
until
the
chief
has
sampled
the
lot
,
he
thinks
we
should
meet
as
seldom
as
possible
on
the
business
of
the
league
,
and
on
no
account
should
talk
to
each
other
in
public
places
for
a
time
.
when
he
wants
to
speak
to
us
,
he
will
contrive
to
let
us
know
.
"
the
two
young
men
were
both
bending
over
the
fire
for
the
blaze
had
died
down
,
and
only
a
red
glow
from
the
dying
embers
cast
a
lurid
light
on
a
narrow
semicircle
in
front
of
the
hearth
.
the
rest
of
the
room
lay
buried
in
complete
gloom
;
sir
andrew
had
taken
a
pocket
-
book
from
his
pocket
,
and
drawn
therefrom
a
paper
,
which
he
unfolded
,
and
together
they
tried
to
read
it
by
the
dim
red
firelight
.
so
intent
were
they
upon
this
,
so
wrapt
up
in
the
cause
,
the
business
they
had
so
much
at
heart
,
so
precious
was
this
document
which
came
from
the
very
hand
of
their
adored
leader
,
that
they
had
eyes
and
ears
only
for
that
.
they
lost
count
of
the
sounds
around
them
,
of
the
dropping
of
the
crisp
ash
from
the
grate
,
of
the
monotonous
ticking
of
the
clock
,
of
the
soft
,
almost
imperceptible
rustle
of
something
on
the
floor
close
beside
them
.
a
figure
had
emerged
from
under
one
of
the
benches
;
with
snake
-
like
,
noiseless
movements
it
crept
closer
and
closer
to
the
two
young
men
,
not
breathing
,
only
gliding
along
the
floor
,
in
the
inky
blackness
of
the
room
.
"
you
are
to
read
these
instructions
and
commit
them
to
memory
,
"
said
sir
andrew
,
"
then
destroy
them
.
"
he
was
about
to
replace
the
letter
-
case
into
his
pocket
,
when
a
tiny
slip
of
paper
fluttered
from
it
and
fell
on
to
the
floor
.
lord
antony
stooped
and
picked
it
up
.
"
what
'
s
that
?
"
he
asked
.
"
i
do
not
know
,
"
replied
sir
andrew
.
"
it
dropped
out
of
your
pocket
just
now
.
it
certainly
does
not
seem
to
be
with
the
other
paper
.
"
"
strange
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
wonder
when
it
got
there
?
it
is
from
the
chief
,
"
he
added
,
glancing
at
the
paper
.
both
stooped
to
try
and
decipher
this
last
tiny
scrap
of
paper
on
which
a
few
words
had
been
hastily
scrawled
,
when
suddenly
a
slight
noise
atrracted
their
attention
,
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
passage
beyond
.
"
what
'
s
that
?
"
said
both
instinctively
.
lord
antony
crossed
the
room
towards
the
door
,
which
he
threw
open
quickly
and
suddenly
;
at
that
very
moment
he
received
a
stunning
blow
between
the
eyes
,
which
threw
him
back
violently
into
the
room
.
simultaneously
the
crouching
,
snake
-
like
figure
in
the
gloom
had
jumped
up
and
hurled
itself
from
behind
upon
the
unsuspecting
sir
andrew
,
felling
him
to
the
ground
.
all
this
occurred
within
the
short
space
of
two
or
three
seconds
,
and
before
either
lord
antony
or
sir
andrew
had
time
or
chance
to
utter
a
cry
or
to
make
the
faintest
struggle
.
they
were
each
seized
by
two
men
,
a
muffler
was
quickly
tied
round
the
mouth
of
each
,
and
they
were
pinioned
to
one
another
back
to
back
,
their
arms
,
hands
,
and
legs
securely
fastened
.
one
man
had
in
the
meanwhile
quietly
shut
the
door
;
he
wore
a
mask
and
now
stood
motionless
while
the
others
completed
their
work
.
"
all
safe
,
citoyen
!
"
said
one
of
the
men
,
as
he
took
a
final
survey
of
the
bonds
which
secured
the
two
young
men
.
"
good
!
"
replied
the
man
at
the
door
;
"
now
search
their
pockets
and
give
me
all
the
papers
you
find
.
"
this
was
promptly
and
quietly
done
.
the
masked
man
having
taken
possession
of
all
the
papers
,
listened
for
a
moment
or
two
if
there
were
any
sound
within
"
the
fisherman
'
s
rest
.
"
evidently
satisfied
that
this
dastardly
outrage
had
remained
unheard
,
he
once
more
opened
the
door
and
pointed
peremptorily
down
the
passage
.
the
four
men
lifted
sir
andrew
and
lord
antony
from
the
ground
,
and
as
quietly
,
as
noiselessly
as
they
had
come
,
they
bore
the
two
pinioned
young
gallants
out
of
the
inn
and
along
the
dover
road
into
the
gloom
beyond
.
in
the
coffee
-
room
the
masked
leader
of
this
daring
attempt
was
quickly
glancing
through
the
stolen
papers
.
"
not
a
bad
day
'
s
work
on
the
whole
,
"
he
muttered
,
as
he
quietly
took
off
his
mask
,
and
his
pale
,
fox
-
like
eyes
glittered
in
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
.
"
not
a
bad
day
'
s
work
.
"
he
opened
one
or
two
letters
from
sir
andrew
ffoulkes
'
pocket
-
book
,
noted
the
tiny
scrap
of
paper
which
the
two
young
men
had
only
just
had
time
to
read
;
but
one
letter
specially
,
signed
armand
st
.
just
,
seemed
to
give
him
strange
satisfaction
.
"
armand
st
.
just
a
traitor
after
all
,
"
he
murmured
.
"
now
,
fair
marguerite
blakeney
,
"
he
added
viciously
between
his
clenched
teeth
,
"
i
think
that
you
will
help
me
to
find
the
scarlet
pimpernel
.
"
it
was
one
of
the
gala
nights
at
covent
garden
theatre
,
the
first
of
the
autumn
season
in
this
memorable
year
of
grace
1792
.
the
house
was
packed
,
both
in
the
smart
orchestra
boxes
and
in
the
pit
,
as
well
as
in
the
more
plebeian
balconies
and
galleries
above
.
gluck
'
s
orpheus
made
a
strong
appeal
to
the
more
intellectual
portions
of
the
house
,
whilst
the
fashionable
women
,
the
gaily
-
dressed
and
brilliant
throng
,
spoke
to
the
eye
of
those
who
cared
but
little
for
this
"
latest
importation
from
germany
.
"
selina
storace
had
been
duly
applauded
after
her
grand
aria
by
her
numerous
admirers
;
benjamin
incledon
,
the
acknowledged
favourite
of
the
ladies
,
had
received
special
gracious
recognition
from
the
royal
box
;
and
now
the
curtain
came
down
after
the
glorious
finale
to
the
second
act
,
and
the
audience
,
which
had
hung
spell
-
bound
on
the
magic
strains
of
the
great
maestro
,
seemed
collectively
to
breathe
a
long
sigh
of
satisfaction
,
previous
to
letting
loose
its
hundreds
of
waggish
and
frivolous
tongues
.
in
the
smart
orchestra
boxes
many
well
-
known
faces
were
to
be
seen
.
mr
pitt
,
overweighted
with
cares
of
state
,
was
finding
brief
relaxation
in
to
-
night
'
s
musical
treat
;
the
prince
of
wales
,
jovial
,
rotund
,
somewhat
coarse
and
commonplace
in
appearance
,
moved
about
from
box
to
box
,
spending
brief
quarters
of
an
hour
with
those
of
his
more
intimate
friends
.
in
lord
grenville
'
s
box
,
too
,
a
curious
,
interesting
personality
attracted
everyone
'
s
attention
;
a
thin
,
small
figure
with
shrewd
,
sarcastic
face
and
deep
-
set
eyes
,
attentive
to
the
music
,
keenly
critical
of
the
audience
,
dressed
in
immaculate
black
,
with
dark
hair
free
from
any
powder
.
lord
grenville
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
foreign
secretary
of
state
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
paid
him
marked
,
though
frigid
deference
.
here
and
there
,
dotted
about
among
distinctly
english
types
of
beauty
,
one
or
two
foreign
faces
stood
out
in
marked
contrast
:
the
haughty
aristocratic
cast
of
countenance
of
the
many
french
royalist
emigres
who
,
persecuted
by
the
relentless
,
revolutionary
faction
of
their
country
,
had
found
a
peaceful
refuge
in
england
.
on
these
faces
sorrow
and
care
were
deeply
writ
;
the
women
especially
paid
but
little
heed
,
either
to
the
music
or
to
the
brilliant
audience
;
no
doubt
their
thoughts
were
far
away
with
husband
,
brother
,
son
maybe
,
still
in
peril
,
or
lately
succumbed
to
a
cruel
fate
.
among
these
the
comtesse
de
tournay
de
basserive
,
but
lately
arrived
from
france
,
was
a
most
conspicuous
figure
:
dressed
in
deep
,
heavy
black
silk
,
with
only
a
white
lace
kerchief
to
relieve
the
aspect
of
mourning
about
her
person
,
she
sat
beside
lady
portarles
,
who
was
vainly
trying
by
witty
sallies
and
somewhat
broad
jokes
,
to
bring
a
smile
to
the
comtesse
'
s
sad
mouth
.
behind
her
sat
little
suzanne
and
the
vicomte
,
both
silent
and
somewhat
shy
among
so
many
strangers
.
suzanne
'
s
eyes
seemed
wistful
;
when
she
first
entered
the
crowded
house
,
she
had
looked
eagerly
all
around
,
scanning
every
face
,
scrutinised
every
box
.
evidently
the
one
face
she
wished
to
see
was
not
there
,
for
she
settled
herself
quietly
behind
her
mother
,
listened
apathetically
to
the
music
,
and
took
no
further
interest
in
the
audience
itself
.
"
ah
,
lord
grenville
,
"
said
lady
portarles
,
as
following
a
discreet
knock
,
the
clever
,
interesting
head
of
the
secretary
of
state
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
box
,
"
you
could
not
arrive
more
a
propos
.
here
is
madame
la
comtesse
de
tournay
positively
dying
to
hear
the
latest
news
from
france
.
"
the
distinguished
diplomat
had
come
forward
and
was
shaking
hands
with
the
ladies
.
"
alas
!
"
he
said
sadly
,
"
it
is
of
the
very
worst
.
the
massacres
continue
;
paris
literally
reeks
with
blood
;
and
the
guillotine
claims
a
hundred
victims
a
day
.
"
pale
and
tearful
,
the
comtesse
was
leaning
back
in
her
chair
,
listening
horror
-
struck
to
this
brief
and
graphic
account
of
what
went
on
in
her
own
misguided
country
.
"
ah
,
monsieur
!
"
she
said
in
broken
english
,
"
it
is
dreadful
to
hear
all
that
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
my
poor
husband
still
in
that
awful
country
.
it
is
terrible
for
me
to
be
sitting
here
,
in
a
theatre
,
all
safe
and
in
peace
,
whilst
he
is
in
such
peril
.
"
"
lud
,
madame
!
"
said
honest
,
bluff
lady
portarles
,
"
your
sitting
in
a
convent
wo
not
make
your
husband
safe
,
and
you
have
your
children
to
consider
:
they
are
too
young
to
be
dosed
with
anxiety
and
premature
mourning
.
"
the
comtesse
smiled
through
her
tears
at
the
vehemence
of
her
friend
.
lady
portarles
,
whose
voice
and
manner
would
not
have
misfitted
a
jockey
,
had
a
heart
of
gold
,
and
hid
the
most
genuine
sympathy
and
most
gentle
kindliness
,
beneath
the
somewhat
coarse
manners
affected
by
some
ladies
at
that
time
.
"
besides
which
,
madame
,
"
added
lord
grenville
,
"
did
you
not
tell
me
yesterday
that
the
league
of
the
scarlet
pimpernel
had
pledged
their
honour
to
bring
m
.
le
comte
safely
across
the
channel
?
"
"
ah
,
yes
!
"
replied
the
comtesse
,
"
and
that
is
my
only
hope
.
i
saw
lord
hastings
yesterday
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
reassured
me
again
.
"
"
then
i
am
sure
you
need
have
no
fear
.
what
the
league
have
sworn
,
that
they
surely
will
accomplish
.
ah
!
"
added
the
old
diplomat
with
a
sigh
,
"
if
i
were
but
a
few
years
younger
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
la
,
man
!
"
interrupted
honest
lady
portarles
,
"
you
are
still
young
enough
to
turn
your
back
on
that
french
scarecrow
that
sits
enthroned
in
your
box
to
-
night
.
"
"
i
wish
i
could
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
your
ladyship
must
remember
that
in
serving
our
country
we
must
put
prejudices
aside
.
m
.
chauvelin
is
the
accredited
agent
of
his
government
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
odd
'
s
fish
,
man
!
"
she
retorted
,
"
you
do
not
call
those
bloodthirsty
ruffians
over
there
a
government
,
do
you
?
"
"
it
has
not
been
thought
advisable
as
yet
,
"
said
the
minister
,
guardedly
,
"
for
england
to
break
off
diplomatic
relations
with
france
,
and
we
cannot
therefore
refuse
to
receive
with
courtesy
the
agent
she
wishes
to
send
to
us
.
"
"
diplomatic
relations
be
demmed
,
my
lord
!
that
sly
little
fox
over
there
is
nothing
but
a
spy
,
i
will
warrant
,
and
you
will
find
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
an
i
am
much
mistaken
,
that
he
will
concern
himself
little
with
such
diplomacy
,
beyond
trying
to
do
mischief
to
royalist
refugees
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
our
heroic
scarlet
pimpernel
and
to
the
members
of
that
brave
little
league
.
"
"
i
am
sure
,
"
said
the
comtesse
,
pursing
up
her
thin
lips
,
"
that
if
this
chauvelin
wishes
to
do
us
mischief
,
he
will
find
a
faithful
ally
in
lady
blakeney
.
"
"
bless
the
woman
!
"
ejaculated
lady
portarles
,
"
did
ever
anyone
see
such
perversity
?
my
lord
grenville
,
you
have
the
gift
of
gab
,
will
you
please
explain
to
madame
la
comtesse
that
she
is
acting
like
a
fool
.
in
your
position
here
in
england
,
madame
,
"
she
added
,
turning
a
wrathful
and
resolute
face
towards
the
comtesse
,
"
you
cannot
afford
to
put
on
the
hoity
-
toity
airs
you
french
aristocrats
are
so
fond
of
.
lady
blakeney
may
or
may
not
be
in
sympathy
with
those
ruffians
in
france
;
she
may
or
may
not
have
had
anything
to
do
with
the
arrest
and
condemnation
of
st
.
cyr
,
or
whatever
the
man
'
s
name
is
,
but
she
is
the
leader
of
fashion
in
this
country
;
sir
percy
blakeney
has
more
money
than
any
half
-
dozen
other
men
put
together
,
he
is
hand
and
glove
with
royalty
,
and
your
trying
to
snub
lady
blakeney
will
not
harm
her
,
but
will
make
you
look
a
fool
.
is
not
that
so
,
my
lord
?
but
what
lord
grenville
thought
of
this
matter
,
or
to
what
reflections
this
comely
tirade
of
lady
portarles
led
the
comtesse
de
tournay
,
remained
unspoken
,
for
the
curtain
had
just
risen
on
the
third
act
of
orpheus
,
and
admonishments
to
silence
came
from
every
part
of
the
house
.
lord
grenville
took
a
hasty
farewell
of
the
ladies
and
slipped
back
into
his
box
,
where
m
.
chauvelin
had
sat
through
this
entr
'
acte
,
with
his
eternal
snuff
-
box
in
his
hand
,
and
with
his
keen
pale
eyes
intently
fixed
upon
a
box
opposite
him
,
where
,
with
much
frou
-
frou
of
silken
skirts
,
much
laughter
and
general
stir
of
curiosity
amongst
the
audience
,
marguerite
blakeney
had
just
entered
,
accompanied
by
her
husband
,
and
looking
divinely
pretty
beneath
the
wealth
of
her
golden
,
reddish
curls
,
slightly
besprinkled
with
powder
,
and
tied
back
at
the
nape
of
her
graceful
neck
with
a
gigantic
black
bow
.
always
dressed
in
the
very
latest
vagary
of
fashion
,
marguerite
alone
among
the
ladies
that
night
had
discarded
the
crossover
fichu
and
broad
-
lapelled
over
-
dress
,
which
had
been
in
fashion
for
the
last
two
or
three
years
.
she
wore
the
short
-
waisted
classical
-
shaped
gown
,
which
so
soon
was
to
become
the
approved
mode
in
every
country
in
europe
.
it
suited
her
graceful
,
regal
figure
to
perfection
,
composed
as
it
was
of
shimmering
stuff
which
seemed
a
mass
of
rich
gold
embroidery
.
as
she
entered
,
she
leant
for
a
moment
out
of
the
box
,
taking
stock
of
all
those
present
whom
she
knew
.
many
bowed
to
her
as
she
did
so
,
and
from
the
royal
box
there
came
also
a
quick
and
gracious
salute
.
chauvelin
watched
her
intently
all
through
the
commencement
of
the
third
act
,
as
she
sat
enthralled
with
the
music
,
her
exquisite
little
hand
toying
with
a
small
jewelled
fan
,
her
regal
head
,
her
throat
,
arms
and
neck
covered
with
magnificent
diamonds
and
rare
gems
,
the
gift
of
the
adoring
husband
who
sprawled
leisurely
by
her
side
.
marguerite
was
passionately
fond
of
music
.
orpheus
charmed
her
to
-
night
.
the
very
joy
of
living
was
writ
plainly
upon
the
sweet
young
face
,
it
sparkled
out
of
the
merry
blue
eyes
and
lit
up
the
smile
that
lurked
around
the
lips
.
she
was
after
all
but
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
in
the
hey
day
of
youth
,
the
darling
of
a
brilliant
throng
,
adored
,
feted
,
petted
,
cherished
.
two
days
ago
the
day
dream
had
returned
from
calais
,
bringing
her
news
that
her
idolised
brother
had
safely
landed
,
that
he
thought
of
her
,
and
would
be
prudent
for
her
sake
.
what
wonder
for
the
moment
,
and
listening
to
gluck
'
s
impassioned
strains
,
that
she
forgot
her
disillusionments
,
forgot
her
vanished
love
-
dreams
,
forgot
even
the
lazy
,
good
-
humoured
nonentity
who
had
made
up
for
his
lack
of
spiritual
attainments
by
lavishing
worldly
advantages
upon
her
.
he
had
stayed
beside
her
in
the
box
just
as
long
as
convention
demanded
,
making
way
for
his
royal
highness
,
and
for
the
host
of
admirers
who
in
a
continued
procession
came
to
pay
homage
to
the
queen
of
fashion
.
sir
percy
had
strolled
away
,
to
talk
to
more
congenial
friends
probably
.
marguerite
did
not
even
wonder
whither
he
had
gone
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
she
cared
so
little
;
she
had
had
a
little
court
round
her
,
composed
of
the
jeunesse
doree
of
london
,
and
had
just
dismissed
them
all
,
wishing
to
be
alone
with
gluck
for
a
brief
while
.
a
discreet
knock
at
the
door
roused
her
from
her
enjoyment
.
"
come
in
,
"
she
said
with
some
impatience
,
without
turning
to
look
at
the
intruder
.
chauvelin
,
waiting
for
his
opportunity
,
noted
that
she
was
alone
,
and
now
,
without
pausing
for
that
impatient
"
come
in
,
"
he
quietly
slipped
into
the
box
,
and
the
next
moment
was
standing
behind
marguerite
'
s
chair
.
"
a
word
with
you
,
citoyenne
,
"
he
said
quietly
.
marguerite
turned
quickly
,
in
alarm
,
which
was
not
altogether
feigned
.
"
lud
,
man
!
you
frightened
me
,
"
she
said
with
a
forced
little
laugh
,
"
your
presence
is
entirely
inopportune
.
i
want
to
listen
to
gluck
,
and
have
no
mind
for
talking
.
"
"
but
this
is
my
only
opportunity
,
"
he
said
,
as
quietly
,
and
without
waiting
for
permission
,
he
drew
a
chair
close
behind
her
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
so
close
that
he
could
whisper
in
her
ear
,
without
disturbing
the
audience
,
and
without
being
seen
,
in
the
dark
background
of
the
box
.
"
this
is
my
only
opportunity
,
"
he
repeated
,
as
he
vouchsafed
him
no
reply
,
"
lady
blakeney
is
always
so
surrounded
,
so
feted
by
her
court
,
that
a
mere
old
friend
has
but
very
little
chance
.
"
"
faith
,
man
!
"
she
said
impatiently
,
"
you
must
seek
for
another
opportunity
then
.
i
am
going
to
lord
grenville
'
s
ball
to
-
night
after
the
opera
.
so
are
you
,
probably
.
i
will
give
you
five
minutes
then
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
three
minutes
in
the
privacy
of
this
box
are
quite
sufficient
for
me
,
"
he
rejoined
placidly
,
"
and
i
think
that
you
will
be
wise
to
listen
to
me
,
citoyenne
st
.
just
.
"
marguerite
instinctively
shivered
.
chauvelin
had
not
raised
his
voice
above
a
whisper
;
he
was
now
quietly
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
yet
there
was
something
in
his
attitude
,
something
in
those
pale
,
foxy
eyes
,
which
seemed
to
freeze
the
blood
in
her
veins
,
as
would
the
sight
of
some
deadly
hitherto
unguessed
peril
.
"
is
that
a
threat
,
citoyen
?
"
she
asked
at
last
.
"
nay
,
fair
lady
,
"
he
said
gallantly
,
"
only
an
arrow
shot
into
the
air
.
"
he
paused
a
moment
,
like
a
cat
which
sees
a
mouse
running
heedlessly
by
,
ready
to
spring
,
yet
waiting
with
that
feline
sense
of
enjoyment
of
mischief
about
to
be
done
.
then
he
said
quietly
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
your
brother
,
st
.
just
,
is
in
peril
.
"
not
a
muscle
moved
in
the
beautiful
face
before
him
.
he
could
only
see
it
in
profile
,
for
marguerite
seemed
to
be
watching
the
stage
intently
,
but
chauvelin
was
a
keen
observer
;
he
noticed
the
sudden
rigidity
of
the
eyes
,
the
hardening
of
the
mouth
,
the
sharp
,
almost
paralysed
tension
of
the
beautiful
,
graceful
figure
.
"
lud
,
then
,
"
she
said
with
affected
merriment
,
"
since
`
tis
one
of
your
imaginary
plots
,
you
'
d
best
go
back
to
your
own
seat
and
leave
me
enjoy
the
music
.
"
and
with
her
hand
she
began
to
beat
time
nervously
against
the
cushion
of
the
box
.
selina
