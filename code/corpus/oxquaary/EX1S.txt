up
at
the
league
,
says
a
friend
,
there
had
been
one
night
a
brisk
conversational
discussion
,
as
to
what
would
happen
on
the
morrow
of
the
revolution
,
finally
shading
off
into
a
vigorous
statement
by
various
friends
of
their
views
on
the
future
of
the
fully
-
developed
new
society
.
says
our
friend
:
considering
the
subject
,
the
discussion
was
good
-
tempered
;
for
those
present
being
used
to
public
meetings
and
after
-
lecture
debates
,
if
they
did
not
listen
to
each
others
'
opinions
(
which
could
scarcely
be
expected
of
them
)
,
at
all
events
did
not
always
attempt
to
speak
all
together
,
as
is
the
custom
of
people
in
ordinary
polite
society
when
conversing
on
a
subject
which
interests
them
.
for
the
rest
,
there
were
six
persons
present
,
and
consequently
six
sections
of
the
party
were
represented
,
four
of
which
had
strong
but
divergent
anarchist
opinions
.
one
of
the
sections
,
says
our
friend
,
a
man
whom
he
knows
very
well
indeed
,
sat
almost
silent
at
the
beginning
of
the
discussion
,
but
at
last
got
drawn
into
it
,
and
finished
by
roaring
out
very
loud
,
and
damning
all
the
rest
for
fools
;
after
which
befel
a
period
of
noise
,
and
then
a
lull
,
during
which
the
aforesaid
section
,
having
said
good
-
night
very
amicably
,
took
his
way
home
by
himself
to
a
western
suburb
,
using
the
means
of
travelling
which
civilisation
has
forced
upon
us
like
a
habit
.
as
he
sat
in
that
vapour
-
bath
of
hurried
and
discontented
humanity
,
a
carriage
of
the
underground
railway
,
he
,
like
others
,
stewed
discontentedly
,
while
in
self
-
reproachful
mood
he
turned
over
the
many
excellent
and
conclusive
arguments
which
,
though
they
lay
at
his
fingers
'
ends
,
he
had
forgotten
in
the
just
past
discussion
.
but
this
frame
of
mind
he
was
so
used
to
,
that
it
did
not
last
him
long
,
and
after
a
brief
discomfort
,
caused
by
disgust
with
himself
for
having
lost
his
temper
(
which
he
was
also
well
used
to
)
,
he
found
himself
musing
on
the
subject
-
matter
of
discussion
,
but
still
discontentedly
and
unhappily
.
"
if
i
could
but
see
a
day
of
it
,
"
he
said
to
himself
;
"
if
i
could
but
see
it
!
"
as
he
formed
the
words
,
the
train
stopped
at
his
station
,
five
minutes
'
walk
from
his
own
house
,
which
stood
on
the
banks
of
the
thames
,
a
little
way
above
an
ugly
suspension
bridge
.
he
went
out
of
the
station
,
still
discontented
and
unhappy
,
muttering
"
if
i
could
but
see
it
!
if
i
could
but
see
it
!
"
but
had
not
gone
many
steps
towards
the
river
before
(
says
our
friend
who
tells
the
story
)
all
that
discontent
and
trouble
seemed
to
slip
off
him
.
it
was
a
beautiful
night
of
early
winter
,
the
air
just
sharp
enough
to
be
refreshing
after
the
hot
room
and
the
stinking
railway
carriage
.
the
wind
,
which
had
lately
turned
a
point
or
two
north
of
west
,
had
blown
the
sky
clear
of
all
cloud
save
a
light
fleck
or
two
which
went
swiftly
down
the
heavens
.
there
was
a
young
moon
halfway
up
the
sky
,
and
as
the
home
-
farer
caught
sight
of
it
,
tangled
in
the
branches
of
a
tall
old
elm
,
he
could
scarce
bring
to
his
mind
the
shabby
london
suburb
where
he
was
,
and
he
felt
as
if
he
were
in
a
pleasant
country
place
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
pleasanter
,
indeed
,
than
the
deep
country
was
as
he
had
known
it
.
he
came
right
down
to
the
river
-
side
,
and
lingered
a
little
,
looking
over
the
low
wall
to
note
the
moonlit
river
,
near
upon
high
water
,
go
swirling
and
glittering
up
to
chiswick
eyot
:
as
for
the
ugly
bridge
below
,
he
did
not
notice
it
or
think
of
it
,
except
when
for
a
moment
(
says
our
friend
)
it
struck
him
that
he
missed
the
row
of
lights
down
stream
.
then
he
turned
to
his
house
door
and
let
himself
in
;
and
even
as
he
shut
the
door
to
,
disappeared
all
remembrance
of
that
brilliant
logic
and
foresight
which
had
so
illuminated
the
recent
discussion
;
and
of
the
discussion
itself
there
remained
no
trace
,
save
a
vague
hope
,
that
was
now
become
a
pleasure
,
for
days
of
peace
and
rest
,
and
cleanness
and
smiling
goodwill
.
in
this
mood
he
tumbled
into
bed
,
and
fell
asleep
after
his
wont
,
in
two
minutes
'
time
;
but
(
contrary
to
his
wont
)
woke
up
again
not
long
after
in
that
curiously
wide
-
awake
condition
which
sometimes
surprises
even
good
sleepers
;
a
condition
under
which
we
feel
all
our
wits
preternaturally
sharpened
,
while
all
the
miserable
muddles
we
have
ever
got
into
,
all
the
disgraces
and
losses
of
our
lives
,
will
insist
on
thrusting
themselves
forward
for
the
consideration
of
those
sharpened
wits
.
in
this
state
he
lay
(
says
our
friend
)
till
he
had
almost
begun
to
enjoy
it
:
till
the
tale
of
his
stupidities
amused
him
,
and
the
entanglements
before
him
,
which
he
saw
so
clearly
,
began
to
shape
themselves
into
an
amusing
story
for
him
.
he
heard
one
o
'
clock
strike
,
then
two
and
then
three
;
after
which
he
fell
asleep
again
.
our
friend
says
that
from
that
sleep
he
awoke
once
more
,
and
afterwards
went
through
such
surprising
adventures
that
he
thinks
that
they
should
be
told
to
our
comrades
,
and
indeed
the
public
in
general
,
and
therefore
proposes
to
tell
them
now
.
but
,
says
he
,
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
i
told
them
in
the
first
person
,
as
if
it
were
myself
who
had
gone
through
them
;
which
,
indeed
,
will
be
the
easier
and
more
natural
to
me
,
since
i
understand
the
feelings
and
desires
of
the
comrade
of
whom
i
am
telling
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
does
.
well
,
i
awoke
,
and
found
that
i
had
kicked
my
bedclothes
off
;
and
no
wonder
,
for
it
was
hot
and
the
sun
shining
brightly
.
i
jumped
up
and
washed
and
hurried
on
my
clothes
,
but
in
a
hazy
and
half
-
awake
condition
,
as
if
i
had
slept
for
a
long
,
long
while
,
and
could
not
shake
off
the
weight
of
slumber
.
in
fact
,
i
rather
took
it
for
granted
that
i
was
at
home
in
my
own
room
than
saw
that
it
was
so
.
when
i
was
dressed
,
i
felt
the
place
so
hot
that
i
made
haste
to
get
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
;
and
my
first
feeling
was
a
delicious
relief
caused
by
the
fresh
air
and
pleasant
breeze
;
my
second
,
as
i
began
to
gather
my
wits
together
,
mere
measureless
wonder
:
for
it
was
winter
when
i
went
to
bed
the
last
night
,
and
now
,
by
witness
of
the
river
-
side
trees
,
it
was
summer
,
a
beautiful
bright
morning
seemingly
of
early
june
.
however
,
there
was
still
the
thames
sparkling
under
the
sun
,
and
near
high
water
,
as
last
night
i
had
seen
it
gleaming
under
the
moon
.
i
had
by
no
means
shaken
off
the
feeling
of
oppression
,
and
wherever
i
might
have
been
should
scarce
have
been
quite
conscious
of
the
place
;
so
it
was
no
wonder
that
i
felt
rather
puzzled
in
despite
of
the
familiar
face
of
the
thames
.
withal
i
felt
dizzy
and
queer
;
and
remembering
that
people
often
got
a
boat
and
had
a
swim
in
mid
-
stream
,
i
thought
i
would
do
no
less
.
it
seems
very
early
,
quoth
i
to
myself
,
but
i
daresay
i
shall
find
someone
at
biffin
'
s
to
take
me
.
however
,
i
did
not
get
as
far
as
biffin
'
s
,
or
even
turn
to
my
left
thitherward
,
because
just
then
i
began
to
see
that
there
was
a
landing
-
stage
right
before
me
in
front
of
my
house
:
in
fact
,
on
the
place
where
my
next
-
door
neighbour
had
rigged
one
up
,
though
somehow
it
did
not
look
like
that
either
.
down
i
went
on
to
it
,
and
sure
enough
among
the
empty
boats
moored
to
it
lay
a
man
on
his
sculls
in
a
solid
-
looking
tub
of
a
boat
clearly
meant
for
bathers
.
he
nodded
to
me
,
and
bade
me
good
-
morning
as
if
he
expected
me
,
so
i
jumped
in
without
any
words
,
and
he
paddled
away
quietly
as
i
peeled
for
my
swim
.
as
we
went
,
i
looked
down
on
the
water
,
and
could
not
help
saying
-
"
how
clear
the
water
is
this
morning
!
"
"
is
it
?
"
said
he
;
"
i
did
not
notice
it
.
you
know
the
flood
-
tide
always
thickens
it
a
bit
.
"
"
h
'
m
,
"
said
i
,
"
i
have
seen
it
pretty
muddy
even
at
half
-
ebb
.
"
he
said
nothing
in
answer
,
but
seemed
rather
astonished
;
and
as
he
now
lay
just
stemming
the
tide
,
and
i
had
my
clothes
off
,
i
jumped
in
without
more
ado
.
of
course
when
i
had
my
head
above
water
again
i
turned
towards
the
tide
,
and
my
eyes
naturally
sought
for
the
bridge
,
and
so
utterly
astonished
was
i
by
what
i
saw
,
that
i
forgot
to
strike
out
,
and
went
spluttering
under
water
again
,
and
when
i
came
up
made
straight
for
the
boat
;
for
i
felt
that
i
must
ask
some
questions
of
my
waterman
,
so
bewildering
had
been
the
half
-
sight
i
had
seen
from
the
face
of
the
river
with
the
water
hardly
out
of
my
eyes
;
though
by
this
time
i
was
quit
of
the
slumbrous
and
dizzy
feeling
,
and
was
wide
-
awake
and
clear
-
headed
.
as
i
got
in
up
the
steps
which
he
had
lowered
,
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
help
me
,
we
went
drifting
speedily
up
towards
chiswick
;
but
now
he
caught
up
the
sculls
and
brought
her
head
round
again
,
and
said
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
a
short
swim
,
neighbour
;
but
perhaps
you
find
the
water
cold
this
morning
,
after
your
journey
.
shall
i
put
you
ashore
at
once
,
or
would
you
like
to
go
down
to
putney
before
breakfast
?
"
he
spoke
in
a
way
so
unlike
what
i
should
have
expected
from
a
hammersmith
waterman
,
that
i
stared
at
him
,
as
i
answered
,
"
please
to
hold
her
a
little
;
i
want
to
look
about
me
a
bit
.
"
"
all
right
,
"
he
said
;
"
it
is
no
less
pretty
in
its
way
here
than
it
is
off
barn
elms
;
it
is
jolly
everywhere
this
time
in
the
morning
.
i
am
glad
you
got
up
early
;
it
is
barely
five
o
'
clock
yet
.
"
if
i
was
astonished
with
my
sight
of
the
river
banks
,
i
was
no
less
astonished
at
my
waterman
,
now
that
i
had
time
to
look
at
him
and
see
him
with
my
head
and
eyes
clear
.
he
was
a
handsome
young
fellow
,
with
a
peculiarly
pleasant
and
friendly
look
about
his
eyes
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
an
expression
which
was
quite
new
to
me
then
,
though
i
soon
became
familiar
with
it
.
for
the
rest
,
he
was
dark
-
haired
and
berry
-
brown
of
skin
,
well
-
knit
and
strong
,
and
obviously
used
to
exercising
his
muscles
,
but
with
nothing
rough
or
coarse
about
him
,
and
clean
as
might
be
.
his
dress
was
not
like
any
modern
work
-
a
-
day
clothes
i
had
seen
,
but
would
have
served
very
well
as
a
costume
for
a
picture
of
fourteenth
century
life
:
it
was
of
dark
blue
cloth
,
simple
enough
,
but
of
fine
web
,
and
without
a
stain
on
it
.
he
had
a
brown
leather
belt
round
his
waist
,
and
i
noticed
that
its
clasp
was
of
damascened
steel
beautifully
wrought
.
in
short
,
he
seemed
to
be
like
some
specially
manly
and
refined
young
gentleman
,
playing
waterman
for
a
spree
,
and
i
concluded
that
this
was
the
case
.
i
felt
that
i
must
make
some
conversation
;
so
i
pointed
to
the
surrey
bank
,
where
i
noticed
some
light
plank
stages
running
down
the
foreshore
,
with
windlasses
at
the
landward
end
of
them
,
and
said
,
"
what
are
they
doing
with
those
things
here
?
if
we
were
on
the
tay
,
i
should
have
said
that
they
were
for
drawing
the
salmon
nets
;
but
here
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
well
,
"
said
he
,
smiling
,
"
of
course
that
is
what
they
are
for
.
where
there
are
salmon
,
there
are
likely
to
be
salmon
-
nets
,
tay
or
thames
;
but
of
course
they
are
not
always
in
use
;
we
do
not
want
salmon
every
day
of
the
season
.
"
i
was
going
to
say
,
"
but
is
this
the
thames
?
"
but
held
my
peace
in
my
wonder
,
and
turned
my
bewildered
eyes
eastward
to
look
at
the
bridge
again
,
and
thence
to
the
shores
of
the
london
river
;
and
surely
there
was
enough
to
astonish
me
.
for
though
there
was
a
bridge
across
the
stream
and
houses
on
its
banks
,
how
all
was
changed
from
last
night
!
the
soap
-
works
with
their
smoke
-
vomiting
chimneys
were
gone
;
the
engineer
'
s
works
gone
;
the
lead
-
works
gone
;
and
no
sound
of
rivetting
and
hammering
came
down
the
west
wind
from
thorneycroft
'
s
.
then
the
bridge
!
i
had
perhaps
dreamed
of
such
a
bridge
,
but
never
seen
such
an
one
out
of
an
illuminated
manuscript
;
for
not
even
the
ponte
vecchio
at
florence
came
anywhere
near
it
.
it
was
of
stone
arches
,
splendidly
solid
,
and
as
graceful
as
they
were
strong
;
high
enough
also
to
let
ordinary
river
traffic
through
easily
.
over
the
parapet
showed
quaint
and
fanciful
little
buildings
,
which
i
supposed
to
be
booths
or
shops
,
beset
with
painted
and
gilded
vanes
and
spirelets
.
the
stone
was
a
little
weathered
,
but
showed
no
marks
of
the
grimy
sootiness
which
i
was
used
to
on
every
london
building
more
than
a
year
old
.
in
short
,
to
me
a
wonder
of
a
bridge
.
the
sculler
noted
my
eager
astonished
look
,
and
said
,
as
if
in
answer
to
my
thoughts
-
"
yes
,
it
is
a
pretty
bridge
,
is
not
it
?
even
the
up
-
stream
bridges
,
which
are
so
much
smaller
,
are
scarcely
daintier
,
and
the
down
-
stream
ones
are
scarcely
more
dignified
and
stately
.
"
i
found
myself
saying
,
almost
against
my
will
,
"
how
old
is
it
?
"
"
oh
,
not
very
old
,
"
he
said
;
"
it
was
built
or
at
least
opened
,
in
2003
.
there
used
to
be
a
rather
plain
timber
bridge
before
then
.
"
the
date
shut
my
mouth
as
if
a
key
had
been
turned
in
a
padlock
fixed
to
my
lips
;
for
i
saw
that
something
inexplicable
had
happened
,
and
that
if
i
said
much
,
i
should
be
mixed
up
in
a
game
of
cross
questions
and
crooked
answers
.
so
i
tried
to
look
unconcerned
,
and
to
glance
in
a
matter
-
of
-
course
way
at
the
banks
of
the
river
,
though
this
is
what
i
saw
up
to
the
bridge
and
a
little
beyond
;
say
as
far
as
the
site
of
the
soap
-
works
.
both
shores
had
a
line
of
very
pretty
houses
,
low
and
not
large
,
standing
back
a
little
way
from
the
river
;
they
were
mostly
built
of
red
brick
and
roofed
with
tiles
,
and
looked
,
above
all
,
comfortable
,
and
as
if
they
were
,
so
to
say
,
alive
,
and
sympathetic
with
the
life
of
the
dwellers
in
them
.
there
was
a
continuous
garden
in
front
of
them
,
going
down
to
the
water
'
s
edge
,
in
which
the
flowers
were
now
blooming
luxuriantly
,
and
sending
delicious
waves
of
summer
scent
over
the
eddying
stream
.
behind
the
houses
,
i
could
see
great
trees
rising
,
mostly
planes
,
and
looking
down
the
water
there
were
the
reaches
towards
putney
almost
as
if
they
were
a
lake
with
a
forest
shore
,
so
thick
were
the
big
trees
;
and
i
said
aloud
,
but
as
if
to
myself
-
"
well
,
i
am
glad
that
they
have
not
built
over
barn
elms
.
"
i
blushed
for
my
fatuity
as
the
words
slipped
out
of
my
mouth
,
and
my
companion
looked
at
me
with
a
half
smile
which
i
thought
i
understood
;
so
to
hide
my
confusion
i
said
,
"
please
take
me
ashore
now
:
i
want
to
get
my
breakfast
.
"
he
nodded
,
and
brought
her
head
round
with
a
sharp
stroke
,
and
in
a
trice
we
were
at
the
landing
-
stage
again
.
he
jumped
out
and
i
followed
him
;
and
of
course
i
was
not
surprised
to
see
him
wait
,
as
if
for
the
inevitable
after
-
piece
that
follows
the
doing
of
a
service
to
a
fellow
-
citizen
.
so
i
put
my
hand
into
my
waistcoat
-
pocket
,
and
said
,
"
how
much
?
"
though
still
with
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
perhaps
i
was
offering
money
to
a
gentleman
.
he
looked
puzzled
,
and
said
,
"
how
much
?
i
do
not
quite
understand
what
you
are
asking
about
.
do
you
mean
the
tide
?
if
so
,
it
is
close
on
the
turn
now
.
"
i
blushed
,
and
said
,
stammering
,
"
please
do
not
take
it
amiss
if
i
ask
you
;
i
mean
no
offence
:
but
what
ought
i
to
pay
you
?
you
see
i
am
a
stranger
,
and
do
not
know
your
customs
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
or
your
coins
.
"
and
therewith
i
took
a
handful
of
money
out
of
my
pocket
,
as
one
does
in
a
foreign
country
.
and
by
the
way
,
i
saw
that
the
silver
had
oxydised
,
and
was
like
a
blackleaded
stove
in
colour
.
he
still
seemed
puzzled
,
but
not
at
all
offended
;
and
he
looked
at
the
coins
with
some
curiosity
.
i
thought
,
well
after
all
,
he
is
a
waterman
,
and
is
considering
what
he
may
venture
to
take
.
he
seems
such
a
nice
fellow
that
i
am
sure
i
do
not
grudge
him
a
little
over
-
payment
.
i
wonder
,
by
the
way
,
whether
i
could
not
hire
him
as
a
guide
for
a
day
or
two
,
since
he
is
so
intelligent
.
therewith
my
new
friend
said
thoughtfully
:
"
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
.
you
think
that
i
have
done
you
a
service
;
so
you
feel
yourself
bound
to
give
me
something
which
i
am
not
to
give
to
a
neighbour
,
unless
he
has
done
something
special
for
me
.
i
have
heard
of
this
kind
of
thing
;
but
pardon
me
for
saying
,
that
it
seems
to
us
a
troublesome
and
roundabout
custom
;
and
we
do
not
know
how
to
manage
it
.
and
you
see
this
ferrying
and
giving
people
casts
about
the
water
is
my
business
,
which
i
would
do
for
anybody
;
so
to
take
gifts
in
connection
with
it
would
look
very
queer
.
besides
,
if
one
person
gave
me
something
,
then
another
might
,
and
another
,
and
so
on
;
and
i
hope
you
wo
not
think
me
rude
if
i
say
that
i
should
not
know
where
to
stow
away
so
many
mementos
of
friendship
.
"
and
he
laughed
loud
and
merrily
,
as
if
the
idea
of
being
paid
for
his
work
was
a
very
funny
joke
.
i
confess
i
began
to
be
afraid
that
the
man
was
mad
,
though
he
looked
sane
enough
;
and
i
was
rather
glad
to
think
that
i
was
a
good
swimmer
,
since
we
were
so
close
to
a
deep
swift
stream
.
however
,
he
went
on
by
no
means
like
a
madman
:
"
as
to
your
coins
,
they
are
curious
,
but
not
very
old
;
they
seem
to
be
all
of
the
reign
of
victoria
;
you
might
give
them
to
some
scantily
-
furnished
museum
.
ours
has
enough
of
such
coins
,
besides
a
fair
number
of
earlier
ones
,
many
of
which
are
beautiful
,
whereas
these
nineteenth
century
ones
are
so
beastly
ugly
,
ai
not
they
?
we
have
a
piece
of
edward
iii
.
,
with
the
king
in
a
ship
,
and
little
leopards
and
fleurs
-
de
-
lys
all
along
the
gunwale
,
so
delicately
worked
.
you
see
,
"
he
said
,
with
something
of
a
smirk
,
"
i
am
fond
of
working
in
gold
and
fine
metals
;
this
buckle
here
is
an
early
piece
of
mine
.
"
no
doubt
i
looked
a
little
shy
of
him
under
the
influence
of
that
doubt
as
to
his
sanity
.
so
he
broke
off
short
,
and
said
in
a
kind
voice
:
"
but
i
see
that
i
am
boring
you
,
and
i
ask
your
pardon
.
for
,
not
to
mince
matters
,
i
can
tell
that
you
are
a
stranger
,
and
must
come
from
a
place
very
unlike
england
.
but
also
it
is
clear
that
it
wo
not
do
to
overdose
you
with
information
about
this
place
,
and
that
you
had
best
suck
it
in
little
by
little
.
further
,
i
should
take
it
as
very
kind
in
you
if
you
would
allow
me
to
be
the
showman
of
our
new
world
to
you
,
since
you
have
stumbled
on
me
first
.
though
indeed
it
will
be
a
mere
kindness
on
your
part
,
for
almost
anybody
would
make
as
good
a
guide
,
and
many
much
better
.
"
there
certainly
seemed
no
flavour
in
him
of
colney
hatch
;
and
besides
i
thought
i
could
easily
shake
him
off
if
it
turned
out
that
he
really
was
mad
;
so
i
said
:
"
it
is
a
very
kind
offer
,
but
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
accept
it
,
unless
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
i
was
going
to
say
,
unless
you
will
let
me
pay
you
properly
;
but
fearing
to
stir
up
colney
hatch
again
,
i
changed
the
sentence
into
,
"
i
fear
i
shall
be
taking
you
away
from
your
work
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
or
your
amusement
.
"
"
o
,
"
he
said
,
"
do
not
trouble
about
that
,
because
it
will
give
me
an
opportunity
of
doing
a
good
turn
to
a
friend
of
mine
,
who
wants
to
take
my
work
here
.
he
is
a
weaver
from
yorkshire
,
who
has
rather
overdone
himself
between
his
weaving
and
his
mathematics
,
both
indoor
work
,
you
see
;
and
being
a
great
friend
of
mine
,
he
naturally
came
to
me
to
get
him
some
outdoor
work
.
if
you
think
you
can
put
up
with
me
,
pray
take
me
as
your
guide
.
"
he
added
presently
:
"
it
is
true
that
i
have
promised
to
go
up
-
stream
to
some
special
friends
of
mine
,
for
the
hay
-
harvest
;
but
they
wo
not
be
ready
for
us
for
more
than
a
week
:
and
besides
,
you
might
go
with
me
,
you
know
,
and
see
some
very
nice
people
,
besides
making
notes
of
our
ways
in
oxfordshire
.
you
could
hardly
do
better
if
you
want
to
see
the
country
.
"
i
felt
myself
obliged
to
thank
him
,
whatever
might
come
of
it
;
and
he
added
eagerly
:
"
well
,
then
,
that
'
s
settled
.
i
will
give
my
friend
call
;
he
is
living
in
the
guest
house
like
you
,
and
if
he
is
not
up
yet
,
he
ought
to
be
this
fine
summer
morning
.
"
therewith
he
took
a
little
silver
bugle
-
horn
from
his
girdle
and
blew
two
or
three
sharp
but
agreeable
notes
on
it
;
and
presently
from
the
house
which
stood
on
the
site
of
my
old
dwelling
(
of
which
more
hereafter
)
another
young
man
came
sauntering
towards
us
.
he
was
not
so
well
-
looking
or
so
strongly
made
as
my
sculler
friend
,
being
sandy
-
haired
,
rather
pale
,
and
not
stout
-
built
;
but
his
face
was
not
wanting
in
that
happy
and
friendly
expression
which
i
had
noticed
in
his
friend
.
as
he
came
up
smiling
towards
us
,
i
saw
with
pleasure
that
i
must
give
up
the
colney
hatch
theory
as
to
the
waterman
,
for
no
two
madmen
ever
behaved
as
they
did
before
a
sane
man
.
his
dress
also
was
of
the
same
cut
as
the
first
man
'
s
,
though
somewhat
gayer
,
the
surcoat
being
light
green
with
a
golden
spray
embroidered
on
the
breast
,
and
his
belt
being
of
filagree
silver
-
work
.
he
gave
me
good
-
day
very
civilly
,
and
greeting
his
friend
joyously
,
said
:
"
well
,
dick
,
what
is
it
this
morning
?
am
i
to
have
my
work
,
or
rather
your
work
?
i
dreamed
last
night
that
we
were
off
up
the
river
fishing
.
"
"
all
right
,
bob
,
"
said
my
sculler
;
"
you
will
drop
into
my
place
,
and
if
you
find
it
too
much
,
there
is
george
brightling
on
the
look
out
for
a
stroke
of
work
,
and
he
lives
close
handy
to
you
.
but
see
,
here
is
a
stranger
who
is
willing
to
amuse
me
to
-
day
by
taking
me
as
his
guide
about
our
country
-
side
,
and
you
may
imagine
i
do
not
want
to
lose
the
opportunity
;
so
you
had
better
take
to
the
boat
at
once
.
but
in
any
case
i
should
not
have
kept
you
out
of
it
for
long
,
since
i
am
due
in
the
hay
-
fields
in
a
few
days
.
"
the
newcomer
rubbed
his
hands
with
glee
,
but
turning
to
me
,
said
in
a
friendly
voice
:
"
neighbour
,
both
you
and
friend
dick
are
lucky
,
and
will
have
a
good
time
to
-
day
,
as
indeed
i
shall
too
.
but
you
had
better
both
come
in
with
me
at
once
and
get
something
to
eat
,
lest
you
should
forget
your
dinner
in
your
amusement
.
i
suppose
you
came
into
the
guest
house
after
i
had
gone
to
bed
last
night
?
"
i
nodded
,
not
caring
to
enter
into
a
long
explanation
which
would
have
led
to
nothing
,
and
which
in
truth
by
this
time
i
should
have
begun
to
doubt
myself
.
and
we
all
three
turned
toward
the
door
of
the
guest
house
.
i
lingered
a
little
behind
the
others
to
have
a
stare
at
this
house
,
which
,
as
i
have
told
you
,
stood
on
the
site
of
my
old
dwelling
.
it
was
a
longish
building
with
its
gable
ends
turned
away
from
the
road
,
and
long
traceried
windows
coming
rather
low
down
set
in
the
wall
that
faced
us
.
it
was
very
handsomely
built
of
red
brick
with
a
lead
roof
;
and
high
up
above
the
windows
there
ran
a
frieze
of
figure
subjects
in
baked
clay
,
very
well
executed
,
and
designed
with
a
force
and
directness
which
i
had
never
noticed
in
modern
work
before
.
the
subjects
i
recognised
at
once
,
and
indeed
was
very
particularly
familiar
with
them
.
however
,
all
this
i
took
in
in
a
minute
;
for
we
were
presently
within
doors
,
and
standing
in
a
hall
with
a
floor
of
marble
mosaic
and
an
open
timber
roof
.
there
were
no
windows
on
the
side
opposite
to
the
river
,
but
arches
below
leading
into
chambers
,
one
of
which
showed
a
glimpse
of
a
garden
beyond
,
and
above
them
a
long
space
of
wall
gaily
painted
(
in
fresco
,
i
thought
)
with
similar
subjects
to
those
of
the
frieze
outside
;
everything
about
the
place
was
handsome
and
generously
solid
as
to
material
;
and
though
it
was
not
very
large
(
somewhat
smaller
than
crosby
hall
perhaps
)
,
one
felt
in
it
that
exhilarating
sense
of
space
and
freedom
which
satisfactory
architecture
always
gives
to
an
unanxious
man
who
is
in
the
habit
of
using
his
eyes
.
in
this
pleasant
place
,
which
of
course
i
knew
to
be
the
hall
of
the
guest
house
,
three
young
women
were
flitting
to
and
fro
.
as
they
were
the
first
of
the
sex
i
had
seen
on
this
eventful
morning
,
i
naturally
looked
at
them
very
attentively
,
and
found
them
at
least
as
good
as
the
gardens
,
the
architecture
,
and
the
male
men
.
as
to
their
dress
,
which
of
course
i
took
note
of
,
i
should
say
that
they
were
decently
veiled
with
drapery
,
and
not
bundled
up
with
millinery
;
that
they
were
clothed
like
women
,
not
upholstered
like
armchairs
,
as
most
women
of
our
time
are
.
in
short
,
their
dress
was
somewhat
between
that
of
the
ancient
classical
costume
and
the
simpler
forms
of
the
fourteenth
century
garments
,
though
it
was
clearly
not
an
imitation
of
either
:
the
materials
were
light
and
gay
to
suit
the
season
.
as
to
the
women
themselves
,
it
was
pleasant
indeed
to
see
them
,
they
were
so
kind
and
happy
-
looking
in
expression
of
face
,
so
shapely
and
well
-
knit
of
body
,
and
thoroughly
healthy
-
looking
and
strong
.
all
were
at
least
comely
,
and
one
of
them
very
handsome
and
regular
of
feature
.
they
came
up
to
us
at
once
merrily
and
without
the
least
affectation
of
shyness
,
and
all
three
shook
hands
with
me
as
if
i
were
a
friend
newly
come
back
from
a
long
journey
:
though
i
could
not
help
noticing
that
they
looked
askance
at
my
garments
;
for
i
had
on
my
clothes
of
last
night
,
and
at
the
best
was
never
a
dressy
person
.
a
word
or
two
from
robert
the
weaver
,
and
they
bustled
about
on
our
behoof
,
and
presently
came
and
took
us
by
the
hands
and
led
us
to
a
table
in
the
pleasantest
corner
of
the
hall
,
where
our
breakfast
was
spread
for
us
;
and
,
as
we
sat
down
,
one
of
them
hurried
out
by
the
chambers
aforesaid
,
and
came
back
again
in
a
little
while
with
a
great
bunch
of
roses
,
very
different
in
size
and
quality
to
what
hammersmith
had
been
wont
to
grow
,
but
very
like
the
produce
of
an
old
country
garden
.
she
hurried
back
thence
into
the
buttery
,
and
came
back
once
more
with
a
delicately
made
glass
,
into
which
she
put
the
flowers
and
set
them
down
in
the
midst
of
our
table
.
one
of
the
others
,
who
had
run
off
also
,
then
came
back
with
a
big
cabbage
-
leaf
filled
with
strawberries
,
some
of
them
barely
ripe
,
and
said
as
she
set
them
on
the
table
,
"
there
,
now
;
i
thought
of
that
before
i
got
up
this
morning
;
but
looking
at
the
stranger
here
getting
into
your
boat
,
dick
,
put
it
out
of
my
head
;
so
that
i
was
not
before
all
the
blackbirds
:
however
,
there
are
a
few
about
as
good
as
you
will
get
them
anywhere
in
hammersmith
this
morning
.
"
robert
patted
her
on
the
head
in
a
friendly
manner
;
and
we
fell
to
on
our
breakfast
,
which
was
simple
enough
,
but
most
delicately
cooked
,
and
set
on
the
table
with
much
daintiness
.
the
bread
was
particularly
good
,
and
was
of
several
different
kinds
,
from
the
big
,
rather
close
,
dark
-
coloured
,
sweet
-
tasting
farmhouse
loaf
,
which
was
most
to
my
liking
,
to
the
thin
pipe
-
stems
of
wheaten
crust
,
such
as
i
have
eaten
in
turin
.
as
i
was
putting
the
first
mouthfuls
into
my
mouth
my
eye
caught
a
carved
and
gilded
inscription
on
the
panelling
,
behind
what
we
should
have
called
the
high
table
in
an
oxford
college
hall
,
and
a
familiar
name
in
it
forced
me
to
read
it
through
.
thus
it
ran
:
"
guests
and
neighbours
,
on
the
site
of
this
guest
-
hall
once
stood
the
lecture
-
room
of
the
hammersmith
socialists
.
drink
a
glass
to
the
memory
!
may
1962
.
"
it
is
difficult
to
tell
you
how
i
felt
as
i
read
these
words
,
and
i
suppose
my
face
showed
how
much
i
was
moved
,
for
both
my
friends
looked
curiously
at
me
,
and
there
was
silence
between
us
for
a
little
while
.
presently
the
weaver
,
who
was
scarcely
so
well
mannered
a
man
as
the
ferryman
,
said
to
me
rather
awkwardly
:
"
guest
,
we
do
not
know
what
to
call
you
:
is
there
any
indiscretion
in
asking
you
your
name
?
"
"
well
,
"
said
i
,
"
i
have
some
doubts
about
it
myself
;
so
suppose
you
call
me
guest
,
which
is
a
family
name
,
you
know
,
and
add
william
to
it
if
you
please
.
"
dick
nodded
kindly
to
me
;
but
a
shade
of
anxiousness
passed
over
the
weaver
'
s
face
,
and
he
said
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
i
hope
you
do
not
mind
my
asking
,
but
would
you
tell
me
where
you
come
from
?
i
am
curious
about
such
things
for
good
reasons
,
literary
reasons
.
"
dick
was
clearly
kicking
him
underneath
the
table
;
but
he
was
not
much
abashed
,
and
awaited
my
answer
somewhat
eagerly
.
as
for
me
,
i
was
just
going
to
blurt
out
"
hammersmith
,
"
when
i
bethought
me
what
an
entanglement
of
cross
purposes
that
would
lead
us
into
;
so
i
took
time
to
invent
a
lie
with
circumstance
,
guarded
by
a
little
truth
,
and
said
:
"
you
see
,
i
have
been
such
a
long
time
away
from
europe
that
things
seem
strange
to
me
now
;
but
i
was
born
and
bred
on
the
edge
of
epping
forest
;
walthamstow
and
woodford
,
to
wit
.
"
"
a
pretty
place
,
too
,
"
broke
in
dick
;
"
a
very
jolly
place
,
now
that
the
trees
have
had
time
to
grow
again
since
the
great
clearing
of
houses
in
1955
.
"
quoth
the
irrepressible
weaver
:
"
dear
neighbour
,
since
you
knew
the
forest
some
time
ago
,
could
you
tell
me
what
truth
there
is
in
the
rumour
that
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
trees
were
all
pollards
?
"
this
was
catching
me
on
my
archaeological
natural
-
history
side
,
and
i
fell
into
the
trap
without
any
thought
of
where
and
when
i
was
;
so
i
began
on
it
,
while
one
of
the
girls
,
the
handsome
one
,
who
had
been
scattering
little
twigs
of
lavender
and
other
sweet
-
smelling
herbs
about
the
floor
,
came
near
to
listen
,
and
stood
behind
me
with
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
in
which
she
held
some
of
the
plant
that
i
used
to
call
balm
:
its
strong
sweet
smell
brought
back
to
my
mind
my
very
early
days
in
the
kitchen
-
garden
at
woodford
,
and
the
large
blue
plums
which
grew
on
the
wall
beyond
the
sweet
-
herb
patch
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
connection
of
memories
which
all
boys
will
see
at
once
.
i
started
off
:
"
when
i
was
a
boy
,
and
for
long
after
,
except
for
a
piece
about
queen
elizabeth
'
s
lodge
,
and
for
the
part
about
high
beech
,
the
forest
was
almost
wholly
made
up
of
pollard
hornbeams
mixed
with
holly
thickets
.
but
when
the
corporation
of
london
took
it
over
about
twenty
-
five
years
ago
,
the
topping
and
lopping
,
which
was
a
part
of
the
old
commoners
'
rights
,
came
to
an
end
,
and
the
trees
were
let
to
grow
.
but
i
have
not
seen
the
place
now
for
many
years
,
except
once
,
when
we
leaguers
went
a
pleasuring
to
high
beech
.
i
was
very
much
shocked
then
to
see
how
it
was
built
-
over
and
altered
;
and
the
other
day
we
heard
that
the
philistines
were
going
to
landscape
-
garden
it
.
but
what
you
were
saying
about
the
building
being
stopped
and
the
trees
growing
is
only
too
good
news
;
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
only
you
know
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
at
that
point
i
suddenly
remembered
dick
'
s
date
,
and
stopped
short
rather
confused
.
the
eager
weaver
did
not
notice
my
confusion
,
but
said
hastily
,
as
if
he
were
almost
aware
of
his
breach
of
good
manners
,
"
but
,
i
say
,
how
old
are
you
?
"
dick
and
the
pretty
girl
both
burst
out
laughing
,
as
if
robert
'
s
conduct
were
excusable
on
the
grounds
of
eccentricity
;
and
dick
said
amidst
his
laughter
:
"
hold
hard
,
bob
;
this
questioning
of
guests
wo
not
do
.
why
,
much
learning
is
spoiling
you
.
you
remind
me
of
the
radical
cobblers
in
the
silly
old
novels
,
who
,
according
to
the
authors
,
were
prepared
to
trample
down
all
good
manners
in
the
pursuit
of
utilitarian
knowledge
.
the
fact
is
,
i
begin
to
think
that
you
have
so
muddled
your
head
with
mathematics
,
and
with
grubbing
into
those
idiotic
old
books
about
political
economy
(
he
he
!
)
,
that
you
scarcely
know
how
to
behave
.
really
,
it
is
about
time
for
you
to
take
to
some
open
-
air
work
,
so
that
you
may
clear
away
the
cobwebs
from
your
brain
.
"
the
weaver
only
laughed
good
-
humouredly
;
and
the
girl
went
up
to
him
and
patted
his
cheek
and
said
laughingly
,
"
poor
fellow
!
he
was
born
so
.
"
as
for
me
,
i
was
a
little
puzzled
,
but
i
laughed
also
,
partly
for
company
'
s
sake
,
and
partly
with
pleasure
at
their
unanxious
happiness
and
good
temper
;
and
before
robert
could
make
the
excuse
to
me
which
he
was
getting
ready
,
i
said
:
"
but
neighbours
"
(
i
had
caught
up
that
word
)
,
"
i
do
not
in
the
least
mind
answering
questions
,
when
i
can
do
so
:
ask
me
as
many
as
you
please
;
it
is
fun
for
me
.
i
will
tell
you
all
about
epping
forest
when
i
was
a
boy
,
if
you
please
;
and
as
to
my
age
,
i
am
not
a
fine
lady
,
you
know
,
so
why
should
not
i
tell
you
?
i
am
hard
on
fifty
-
six
.
"
in
spite
of
the
recent
lecture
on
good
manners
,
the
weaver
could
not
help
giving
a
long
"
whew
"
of
astonishment
,
and
the
others
were
so
amused
by
his
naivete
that
the
merriment
flitted
all
over
their
faces
,
though
for
courtesy
'
s
sake
they
forbore
actual
laughter
;
while
i
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
a
puzzled
manner
,
and
at
last
said
:
"
tell
me
,
please
,
what
is
amiss
:
you
know
i
want
to
learn
from
you
.
and
please
laugh
;
only
tell
me
.
"
well
,
they
did
laugh
,
and
i
joined
them
again
,
for
the
above
-
stated
reasons
.
but
at
last
the
pretty
woman
said
coaxingly
-
"
well
,
well
,
he
is
rude
,
poor
fellow
!
but
you
see
i
may
as
well
tell
you
what
he
is
thinking
about
:
he
means
that
you
look
rather
old
for
your
age
.
but
surely
there
need
be
no
wonder
in
that
,
since
you
have
been
travelling
;
and
clearly
from
all
you
have
been
saying
,
in
unsocial
countries
.
it
has
often
been
said
,
and
no
doubt
truly
,
that
one
ages
very
quickly
if
one
lives
amongst
unhappy
people
.
also
they
say
that
southern
england
is
a
good
place
for
keeping
good
looks
.
"
she
blushed
and
said
:
"
how
old
am
i
,
do
you
think
?
"
"
well
,
"
quoth
i
,
"
i
have
always
been
told
that
a
woman
is
as
old
as
she
looks
,
so
without
offence
or
flattery
,
i
should
say
that
you
were
twenty
.
"
she
laughed
merrily
,
and
said
,
"
i
am
well
served
out
for
fishing
for
compliments
,
since
i
have
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
to
wit
,
that
i
am
forty
-
two
.
"
i
stared
at
her
,
and
drew
musical
laughter
from
her
again
;
but
i
might
well
stare
,
for
there
was
not
a
careful
line
on
her
face
;
her
skin
was
as
smooth
as
ivory
,
her
cheeks
full
and
round
,
her
lips
as
red
as
the
roses
she
had
brought
in
;
her
beautiful
arms
,
which
she
had
bared
for
her
work
,
firm
and
well
-
knit
from
shoulder
to
wrist
.
she
blushed
a
little
under
my
gaze
,
though
it
was
clear
that
she
had
taken
me
for
a
man
of
eighty
;
so
to
pass
it
off
i
said
"
well
,
you
see
,
the
old
saw
is
proved
right
again
,
and
i
ought
not
to
have
let
you
tempt
me
into
asking
you
a
rude
question
.
"
she
laughed
again
,
and
said
:
"
well
,
lads
,
old
and
young
,
i
must
get
to
my
work
now
.
we
shall
be
rather
busy
here
presently
;
and
i
want
to
clear
it
off
soon
,
for
i
began
to
read
a
pretty
old
book
yesterday
,
and
i
want
to
get
on
with
it
this
morning
:
so
good
-
bye
for
the
present
.
"
she
waved
a
hand
to
us
,
and
stepped
lightly
down
the
hall
,
taking
(
as
scott
says
)
at
least
part
of
the
sun
from
our
table
as
she
went
.
when
she
was
gone
,
dick
said
"
now
guest
,
wo
not
you
ask
a
question
or
two
of
our
friend
here
?
it
is
only
fair
that
you
should
have
your
turn
.
"
"
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
answer
them
,
"
said
the
weaver
.
"
if
i
ask
you
any
questions
,
sir
,
"
said
i
,
"
they
will
not
be
very
severe
;
but
since
i
hear
that
you
are
a
weaver
,
i
should
like
to
ask
you
something
about
that
craft
,
as
i
am
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
or
was
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
interested
in
it
.
"
"
oh
,
"
said
he
,
"
i
shall
not
be
of
much
use
to
you
there
,
i
am
afraid
.
i
only
do
the
most
mechanical
kind
of
weaving
,
and
am
in
fact
but
a
poor
craftsman
,
unlike
dick
here
.
then
besides
the
weaving
,
i
do
a
little
with
machine
printing
and
composing
,
though
i
am
little
use
at
the
finer
kinds
of
printing
;
and
moreover
machine
printing
is
beginning
to
die
out
,
along
with
the
waning
of
the
plague
of
book
-
making
,
so
i
have
had
to
turn
to
other
things
that
i
have
a
taste
for
,
and
have
taken
to
mathematics
;
and
also
i
am
writing
a
sort
of
antiquarian
book
about
the
peaceable
and
private
history
,
so
to
say
,
of
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
more
for
the
sake
of
giving
a
picture
of
the
country
before
the
fighting
began
than
for
anything
else
.
that
was
why
i
asked
you
those
questions
about
epping
forest
.
you
have
rather
puzzled
me
,
i
confess
,
though
your
information
was
so
interesting
.
but
later
on
,
i
hope
,
we
may
have
some
more
talk
together
,
when
our
friend
dick
is
not
here
.
i
know
he
thinks
me
rather
a
grinder
,
and
despises
me
for
not
being
very
deft
with
my
hands
:
that
'
s
the
way
nowadays
.
from
what
i
have
read
of
the
nineteenth
century
literature
(
and
i
have
read
a
good
deal
)
,
it
is
clear
to
me
that
this
is
a
kind
of
revenge
for
the
stupidity
of
that
day
,
which
despised
everybody
who
could
use
his
hands
.
but
dick
,
old
fellow
,
ne
quid
nimis
!
do
not
overdo
it
!
"
"
come
now
,
"
said
dick
,
"
am
i
likely
to
?
am
i
not
the
most
tolerant
man
in
the
world
?
am
i
not
quite
contented
so
long
as
you
do
not
make
me
learn
mathematics
,
or
go
into
your
new
science
of
aesthetics
,
and
let
me
do
a
little
practical
aesthetics
with
my
gold
and
steel
,
and
the
blowpipe
and
the
nice
little
hammer
?
but
,
hillo
!
here
comes
another
questioner
for
you
,
my
poor
guest
.
i
say
,
bob
,
you
must
help
me
to
defend
him
now
.
"
"
here
,
boffin
,
"
he
cried
out
,
after
a
pause
;
"
here
we
are
,
if
you
must
have
it
!
"
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
,
and
saw
something
flash
and
gleam
in
the
sunlight
that
lay
across
the
hall
;
so
i
turned
round
,
and
at
my
ease
saw
a
splendid
figure
slowly
sauntering
over
the
pavement
;
a
man
whose
surcoat
was
embroidered
most
copiously
as
well
as
elegantly
,
so
that
the
sun
flashed
back
from
him
as
if
he
had
been
clad
in
golden
armour
.
the
man
himself
was
tall
,
dark
-
haired
,
and
exceedingly
handsome
,
and
though
his
face
was
no
less
kindly
in
expression
than
that
of
the
others
,
he
moved
with
that
somewhat
haughty
mien
which
great
beauty
is
apt
to
give
to
both
men
and
women
.
he
came
and
sat
down
at
our
table
with
a
smiling
face
,
stretching
out
his
long
legs
and
hanging
his
arm
over
the
chair
in
the
slowly
graceful
way
which
tall
and
well
-
built
people
may
use
without
affectation
.
he
was
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
,
but
looked
as
happy
as
a
child
who
has
just
got
a
new
toy
.
he
bowed
gracefully
to
me
and
said
-
"
i
see
clearly
that
you
are
the
guest
,
of
whom
annie
has
just
told
me
,
who
have
come
from
some
distant
country
that
does
not
know
of
us
,
or
our
ways
of
life
.
so
i
daresay
you
would
not
mind
answering
me
a
few
questions
;
for
you
see
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
here
dick
broke
in
:
"
no
,
please
,
boffin
!
let
it
alone
for
the
present
.
of
course
you
want
the
guest
to
be
happy
and
comfortable
;
and
how
can
that
be
if
he
has
to
trouble
himself
with
answering
all
sorts
of
questions
while
he
is
still
confused
with
the
new
customs
and
people
about
him
?
no
,
no
:
i
am
going
to
take
him
where
he
can
ask
questions
himself
,
and
have
them
answered
;
that
is
,
to
my
great
-
grandfather
in
bloomsbury
:
and
i
am
sure
you
ca
not
have
anything
to
say
against
that
.
so
instead
of
bothering
,
you
had
much
better
go
out
to
james
allen
'
s
and
get
a
carriage
for
me
,
as
i
shall
drive
him
up
myself
;
and
please
tell
jim
to
let
me
have
the
old
grey
,
for
i
can
drive
a
wherry
much
better
than
a
carriage
.
jump
up
,
old
fellow
,
and
do
not
be
disappointed
;
our
guest
will
keep
himself
for
you
and
your
stories
.
"
i
stared
at
dick
;
for
i
wondered
at
his
speaking
to
such
a
dignified
-
looking
personage
so
familiarly
,
not
to
say
curtly
;
for
i
thought
that
this
mr
boffin
,
in
spite
of
his
well
-
known
name
out
of
dickens
,
must
be
at
the
least
a
senator
of
these
strange
people
.
however
,
he
got
up
and
said
,
"
all
right
,
old
oar
-
wearer
,
whatever
you
like
;
this
is
not
one
of
my
busy
days
;
and
though
"
(
with
a
condescending
bow
to
me
)
"
my
pleasure
of
a
talk
with
this
learned
guest
is
put
off
,
i
admit
that
he
ought
to
see
your
worthy
kinsman
as
soon
as
possible
.
besides
,
perhaps
he
will
be
the
better
able
to
answer
my
questions
after
his
own
have
been
answered
.
"
and
therewith
he
turned
and
swung
himself
out
of
the
hall
.
when
he
was
well
gone
,
i
said
:
"
is
it
wrong
to
ask
what
mr
boffin
is
?
whose
name
,
by
the
way
,
reminds
me
of
many
pleasant
hours
passed
in
reading
dickens
.
"
dick
laughed
.
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
said
he
,
"
as
it
does
us
.
i
see
you
take
the
allusion
.
of
course
his
real
name
is
not
boffin
,
but
henry
johnson
;
we
only
call
him
boffin
as
a
joke
,
partly
because
he
is
a
dustman
,
and
partly
because
he
will
dress
so
showily
,
and
get
as
much
gold
on
him
as
a
baron
of
the
middle
ages
.
as
why
should
he
not
if
he
likes
?
only
we
are
his
special
friends
,
you
know
,
so
of
course
we
jest
with
him
.
"
i
held
my
tongue
for
some
time
after
that
;
but
dick
went
on
:
"
he
is
a
capital
fellow
,
and
you
ca
not
help
liking
him
;
but
he
has
a
weakness
:
he
will
spend
his
time
in
writing
reactionary
novels
,
and
is
very
proud
of
getting
the
local
colour
right
,
as
he
calls
it
;
and
as
he
thinks
you
come
from
some
forgotten
corner
of
the
earth
,
where
people
are
unhappy
,
and
consequently
interesting
to
a
story
-
teller
,
he
thinks
he
might
get
some
information
out
of
you
.
o
,
he
will
be
quite
straightforward
with
you
,
for
that
matter
.
only
for
your
own
comfort
beware
of
him
!
"
"
well
,
dick
,
"
said
the
weaver
,
doggedly
,
"
i
think
his
novels
are
very
good
.
"
"
of
course
you
do
,
"
said
dick
;
"
birds
of
a
feather
flock
together
;
mathematics
and
antiquarian
novels
stand
on
much
the
same
footing
.
but
here
he
comes
again
.
"
and
in
effect
the
golden
dustman
hailed
us
from
the
hall
-
door
;
so
we
all
got
up
and
went
into
the
porch
,
before
which
,
with
a
strong
grey
horse
in
the
shafts
,
stood
a
carriage
ready
for
us
which
i
could
not
help
noticing
.
it
was
light
and
handy
,
but
had
none
of
that
sickening
vulgarity
which
i
had
known
as
inseparable
from
the
carriages
of
our
time
,
especially
the
"
elegant
"
ones
,
but
was
as
graceful
and
pleasant
in
line
as
a
wessex
waggon
.
we
got
in
,
dick
and
i
.
the
girls
,
who
had
come
into
the
porch
to
see
us
off
,
waved
their
hands
to
us
;
the
weaver
nodded
kindly
;
the
dustman
bowed
as
gracefully
as
a
troubadour
;
dick
shook
the
reins
,
and
we
were
off
.
we
turned
away
from
the
river
at
once
,
and
were
soon
in
the
main
road
that
runs
through
hammersmith
.
but
i
should
have
had
no
guess
as
to
where
i
was
,
if
i
had
not
started
from
the
waterside
;
for
king
street
was
gone
,
and
the
highway
ran
through
wide
sunny
meadows
and
garden
-
like
tillage
.
the
creek
,
which
we
crossed
at
once
,
had
been
rescued
from
its
culvert
,
and
as
we
went
over
its
pretty
bridge
we
saw
its
waters
,
yet
swollen
by
the
tide
,
covered
with
gay
boats
of
different
sizes
.
there
were
houses
about
,
some
on
the
road
,
some
amongst
the
fields
with
pleasant
lanes
leading
down
to
them
,
and
each
surrounded
by
a
teeming
garden
.
they
were
all
pretty
in
design
,
and
as
solid
as
might
be
,
but
countryfied
in
appearance
,
like
yeomen
'
s
dwellings
;
some
of
them
of
red
brick
like
those
by
the
river
,
but
more
of
timber
and
plaster
,
which
were
by
the
necessity
of
their
construction
so
like
mediaeval
houses
of
the
same
materials
that
i
fairly
felt
as
if
i
were
alive
in
the
fourteenth
century
;
a
sensation
helped
out
by
the
costume
of
the
people
that
we
met
or
passed
,
in
whose
dress
there
was
nothing
"
modern
.
"
almost
everybody
was
gaily
dressed
,
but
especially
the
women
,
who
were
so
well
-
looking
,
or
even
so
handsome
,
that
i
could
scarcely
refrain
my
tongue
from
calling
my
companion
'
s
attention
to
the
fact
.
some
faces
i
saw
that
were
thoughtful
,
and
in
these
i
noticed
great
nobility
of
expression
,
but
none
that
had
a
glimmer
of
unhappiness
,
and
the
greater
part
(
we
came
upon
a
good
many
people
)
were
frankly
and
openly
joyous
.
i
thought
i
knew
the
broadway
by
the
lie
of
the
roads
that
still
met
there
.
on
the
north
side
of
the
road
was
a
range
of
buildings
and
courts
,
low
,
but
very
handsomely
built
and
ornamented
,
and
in
that
way
forming
a
great
contrast
to
the
unpretentiousness
of
the
houses
round
about
;
while
above
this
lower
building
rose
the
steep
lead
-
covered
roof
and
the
buttresses
and
higher
part
of
the
wall
of
a
great
hall
,
of
a
splendid
and
exuberant
style
of
architecture
,
of
which
one
can
say
little
more
than
that
it
seemed
to
me
to
embrace
the
best
qualities
of
the
gothic
of
northern
europe
with
those
of
the
saracenic
and
byzantine
,
though
there
was
no
copying
of
any
one
of
these
styles
.
on
the
other
,
the
south
side
,
of
the
road
was
an
octagonal
building
with
a
high
roof
,
not
unlike
the
baptistry
at
florence
in
outline
,
except
that
it
was
surrounded
by
a
lean
-
to
that
clearly
made
an
arcade
or
cloisters
to
it
:
it
also
was
most
delicately
ornamented
.
this
whole
mass
of
architecture
which
we
had
come
upon
so
suddenly
from
amidst
the
pleasant
fields
was
not
only
exquisitely
beautiful
in
itself
,
but
it
bore
upon
it
the
expression
of
such
generosity
and
abundance
of
life
that
i
was
exhilarated
to
a
pitch
that
i
had
never
yet
reached
.
i
fairly
chuckled
for
pleasure
.
my
friend
seemed
to
understand
it
,
and
sat
looking
on
me
with
a
pleased
and
affectionate
interest
.
we
had
pulled
up
amongst
a
crowd
of
carts
,
wherein
sat
handsome
healthy
-
looking
people
,
men
,
women
,
and
children
very
gaily
dressed
,
and
which
were
clearly
market
carts
,
as
they
were
full
of
very
tempting
-
looking
country
produce
.
i
said
,
"
i
need
not
ask
if
this
is
a
market
,
for
i
see
clearly
that
it
is
;
but
what
market
is
it
that
it
is
so
splendid
?
and
what
is
the
glorious
hall
there
,
and
what
is
the
building
on
the
south
side
?
"
"
o
,
"
said
he
,
"
it
is
just
our
hammersmith
market
;
and
i
am
glad
you
like
it
so
much
,
for
we
are
really
proud
of
it
.
of
course
the
hall
inside
is
our
winter
mote
-
house
;
for
in
summer
we
mostly
meet
in
the
fields
down
by
the
river
opposite
barn
elms
.
the
building
on
our
right
hand
is
our
theatre
:
i
hope
you
like
it
.
"
"
i
should
be
a
fool
if
i
didn
'
t
,
"
said
i
.
he
blushed
a
little
as
he
said
:
"
i
am
glad
of
that
,
too
,
because
i
had
a
hand
in
it
;
i
made
the
great
doors
,
which
are
of
damascened
bronze
.
we
will
look
at
them
later
in
the
day
,
perhaps
:
but
we
ought
to
be
getting
on
now
.
as
to
the
market
,
this
is
not
one
of
our
busy
days
;
so
we
shall
do
better
with
it
another
time
,
because
you
will
see
more
people
.
"
i
thanked
him
,
and
said
:
"
are
these
the
regular
country
people
?
what
very
pretty
girls
there
are
amongst
them
.
"
as
i
spoke
,
my
eye
caught
the
face
of
a
beautiful
woman
,
tall
,
dark
-
haired
,
and
white
-
skinned
,
dressed
in
a
pretty
light
-
green
dress
in
honour
of
the
season
and
the
hot
day
,
who
smiled
kindly
on
me
,
and
more
kindly
still
,
i
thought
on
dick
;
so
i
stopped
a
minute
,
but
presently
went
on
:
"
i
ask
because
i
do
not
see
any
of
the
country
-
looking
people
i
should
have
expected
to
see
at
a
market
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
mean
selling
things
there
.
"
"
i
do
not
understand
,
"
said
he
,
"
what
kind
of
people
you
would
expect
to
see
;
nor
quite
what
you
mean
by
'
country
'
people
.
these
are
the
neighbours
,
and
that
like
they
run
in
the
thames
valley
.
there
are
parts
of
these
islands
which
are
rougher
and
rainier
than
we
are
here
,
and
there
people
are
rougher
in
their
dress
;
and
they
themselves
are
tougher
and
more
hard
-
bitten
than
we
are
to
look
at
.
but
some
people
like
their
looks
better
than
ours
;
they
say
they
have
more
character
in
them
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
'
s
the
word
.
well
,
it
is
a
matter
of
taste
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
anyhow
,
the
cross
between
us
and
them
generally
turns
out
well
,
"
added
he
,
thoughtfully
.
i
heard
him
,
though
my
eyes
were
turned
away
from
him
,
for
that
pretty
girl
was
just
disappearing
through
the
gate
with
her
big
basket
of
early
peas
,
and
i
felt
that
disappointed
kind
of
feeling
which
overtakes
one
when
one
has
seen
an
interesting
or
lovely
face
in
the
streets
which
one
is
never
likely
to
see
again
;
and
i
was
silent
a
little
.
at
last
i
said
:
"
what
i
mean
is
,
that
i
have
not
seen
any
poor
people
about
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
not
one
.
"
he
knit
his
brows
,
looked
puzzled
,
and
said
:
"
no
,
naturally
;
if
anybody
is
poorly
,
he
is
likely
to
be
within
doors
,
or
at
best
crawling
about
the
garden
:
but
i
do
not
know
of
any
one
sick
at
present
.
why
should
you
expect
to
see
poorly
people
on
the
road
?
"
"
no
,
no
,
"
i
said
;
"
i
do
not
mean
sick
people
.
i
mean
poor
people
,
you
know
;
rough
people
.
"
"
no
,
"
said
he
,
smiling
merrily
,
"
i
really
do
not
know
.
the
fact
is
,
you
must
come
along
quick
to
my
great
-
grandfather
,
who
will
understand
you
better
than
i
do
.
come
on
,
greylocks
!
"
therewith
he
shook
the
reins
,
and
we
jogged
along
merrily
eastward
.
past
the
broadway
there
were
fewer
houses
on
either
side
.
we
presently
crossed
a
pretty
little
brook
that
ran
across
a
piece
of
land
dotted
over
with
trees
,
and
awhile
after
came
to
another
market
and
town
-
hall
,
as
we
should
call
it
.
although
there
was
nothing
familiar
to
me
in
its
surroundings
,
i
knew
pretty
well
where
we
were
,
and
was
not
surprised
when
my
guide
said
briefly
,
"
kensington
market
.
"
just
after
this
we
came
into
a
short
street
of
houses
:
or
rather
,
one
long
house
on
either
side
of
the
way
,
built
of
timber
and
plaster
,
and
with
a
pretty
arcade
over
the
footway
before
it
.
quoth
dick
:
"
this
is
kensington
proper
.
people
are
apt
to
gather
here
rather
thick
,
for
they
like
the
romance
of
the
wood
;
and
naturalists
haunt
it
,
too
;
for
it
is
a
wild
spot
even
here
,
what
there
is
of
it
;
for
it
does
not
go
far
to
the
south
:
it
goes
from
here
northward
and
west
right
over
paddington
and
a
little
way
down
notting
hill
:
thence
it
runs
north
-
east
to
primrose
hill
,
and
so
on
;
rather
a
narrow
strip
of
it
gets
through
kingsland
to
stoke
-
newington
and
clapton
,
where
it
spreads
out
along
the
heights
above
the
lea
marshes
;
on
the
other
side
of
which
,
as
you
know
,
is
epping
forest
holding
out
a
hand
to
it
.
this
part
we
are
just
coming
to
is
called
kensington
gardens
;
though
why
'
gardens
'
i
do
not
know
.
"
i
rather
longed
to
say
,
"
well
,
_
i
_
know
"
;
but
there
were
so
many
things
about
me
which
i
did
not
know
,
in
spite
of
his
assumptions
,
that
i
thought
it
better
to
hold
my
tongue
.
the
road
plunged
at
once
into
a
beautiful
wood
spreading
out
on
either
side
,
but
obviously
much
further
on
the
north
side
,
where
even
the
oaks
and
sweet
chestnuts
were
of
a
good
growth
;
while
the
quicker
-
growing
trees
(
amongst
which
i
thought
the
planes
and
sycamores
too
numerous
)
were
very
big
and
fine
-
grown
.
it
was
exceedingly
pleasant
in
the
dappled
shadow
,
for
the
day
was
growing
as
hot
as
need
be
,
and
the
coolness
and
shade
soothed
my
excited
mind
into
a
condition
of
dreamy
pleasure
,
so
that
i
felt
as
if
i
should
like
to
go
on
for
ever
through
that
balmy
freshness
.
my
companion
seemed
to
share
in
my
feelings
,
and
let
the
horse
go
slower
and
slower
as
he
sat
inhaling
the
green
forest
scents
,
chief
amongst
which
was
the
smell
of
the
trodden
bracken
near
the
wayside
.
romantic
as
this
kensington
wood
was
,
however
,
it
was
not
lonely
.
we
came
on
many
groups
both
coming
and
going
,
or
wandering
in
the
edges
of
the
wood
.
amongst
these
were
many
children
from
six
or
eight
years
old
up
to
sixteen
or
seventeen
.
they
seemed
to
me
to
be
especially
fine
specimens
of
their
race
,
and
enjoying
themselves
to
the
utmost
;
some
of
them
were
hanging
about
little
tents
pitched
on
the
greensward
,
and
by
some
of
these
fires
were
burning
,
with
pots
hanging
over
them
gipsy
fashion
.
dick
explained
to
me
that
there
were
scattered
houses
in
the
forest
,
and
indeed
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
one
or
two
.
he
said
they
were
mostly
quite
small
,
such
as
used
to
be
called
cottages
when
there
were
slaves
in
the
land
,
but
they
were
pleasant
enough
and
fitting
for
the
wood
.
"
they
must
be
pretty
well
stocked
with
children
,
"
said
i
,
pointing
to
the
many
youngsters
about
the
way
.
"
o
,
"
said
he
,
"
these
children
do
not
all
come
from
the
near
houses
,
the
woodland
houses
,
but
from
the
country
-
side
generally
.
they
often
make
up
parties
,
and
come
to
play
in
the
woods
for
weeks
together
in
summer
-
time
,
living
in
tents
,
as
you
see
.
we
rather
encourage
them
to
it
;
they
learn
to
do
things
for
themselves
,
and
get
to
notice
the
wild
creatures
;
and
,
you
see
,
the
less
they
stew
inside
houses
the
better
for
them
.
indeed
,
i
must
tell
you
that
many
grown
people
will
go
to
live
in
the
forests
through
the
summer
;
though
they
for
the
most
part
go
to
the
bigger
ones
,
like
windsor
,
or
the
forest
of
dean
,
or
the
northern
wastes
.
apart
from
the
other
pleasures
of
it
,
it
gives
them
a
little
rough
work
,
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
is
getting
somewhat
scarce
for
these
last
fifty
years
.
"
he
broke
off
,
and
then
said
,
"
i
tell
you
all
this
,
because
i
see
that
if
i
talk
i
must
be
answering
questions
,
which
you
are
thinking
,
even
if
you
are
not
speaking
them
out
;
but
my
kinsman
will
tell
you
more
about
it
.
"
i
saw
that
i
was
likely
to
get
out
of
my
depth
again
,
and
so
merely
for
the
sake
of
tiding
over
an
awkwardness
and
to
say
something
,
i
said
-
"
well
,
the
youngsters
here
will
be
all
the
fresher
for
school
when
the
summer
gets
over
and
they
have
to
go
back
again
.
"
"
school
?
"
he
said
;
"
yes
,
what
do
you
mean
by
that
word
?
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
have
anything
to
do
with
children
.
we
talk
,
indeed
,
of
a
school
of
herring
,
and
a
school
of
painting
,
and
in
the
former
sense
we
might
talk
of
a
school
of
children
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
otherwise
,
"
said
he
,
laughing
,
"
i
must
own
myself
beaten
.
"
hang
it
!
thought
i
,
i
ca
not
open
my
mouth
without
digging
up
some
new
complexity
.
i
would
not
try
to
set
my
friend
right
in
his
etymology
;
and
i
thought
i
had
best
say
nothing
about
the
boy
-
farms
which
i
had
been
used
to
call
schools
,
as
i
saw
pretty
clearly
that
they
had
disappeared
;
so
i
said
after
a
little
fumbling
,
"
i
was
using
the
word
in
the
sense
of
a
system
of
education
.
"
"
education
?
"
said
he
,
meditatively
,
"
i
know
enough
latin
to
know
that
the
word
must
come
from
educere
,
to
lead
out
;
and
i
have
heard
it
used
;
but
i
have
never
met
anybody
who
could
give
me
a
clear
explanation
of
what
it
means
.
"
you
may
imagine
how
my
new
friends
fell
in
my
esteem
when
i
heard
this
frank
avowal
;
and
i
said
,
rather
contemptuously
,
"
well
,
education
means
a
system
of
teaching
young
people
.
"
"
why
not
old
people
also
?
"
said
he
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
.
"
but
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
i
can
assure
you
our
children
learn
,
whether
they
go
through
a
'
system
of
teaching
'
or
not
.
why
,
you
will
not
find
one
of
these
children
about
here
,
boy
or
girl
,
who
cannot
swim
;
and
every
one
of
them
has
been
used
to
tumbling
about
the
little
forest
ponies
-
-
there
'
s
one
of
them
now
!
they
all
of
them
know
how
to
cook
;
the
bigger
lads
can
mow
;
many
can
thatch
and
do
odd
jobs
at
carpentering
;
or
they
know
how
to
keep
shop
.
i
can
tell
you
they
know
plenty
of
things
.
"
"
yes
,
but
their
mental
education
,
the
teaching
of
their
minds
,
"
said
i
,
kindly
translating
my
phrase
.
"
guest
,
"
said
he
,
"
perhaps
you
have
not
learned
to
do
these
things
i
have
been
speaking
about
;
and
if
that
'
s
the
case
,
do
not
you
run
away
with
the
idea
that
it
does
not
take
some
skill
to
do
them
,
and
does
not
give
plenty
of
work
for
one
'
s
mind
:
you
would
change
your
opinion
if
you
saw
a
dorsetshire
lad
thatching
,
for
instance
.
but
,
however
,
i
understand
you
to
be
speaking
of
book
-
learning
;
and
as
to
that
,
it
is
a
simple
affair
.
most
children
,
seeing
books
lying
about
,
manage
to
read
by
the
time
they
are
four
years
old
;
though
i
am
told
it
has
not
always
been
so
.
as
to
writing
,
we
do
not
encourage
them
to
scrawl
too
early
(
though
scrawl
a
little
they
will
)
,
because
it
gets
them
into
a
habit
of
ugly
writing
;
and
what
'
s
the
use
of
a
lot
of
ugly
writing
being
done
,
when
rough
printing
can
be
done
so
easily
.
you
understand
that
handsome
writing
we
like
,
and
