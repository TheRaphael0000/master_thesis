when
in
compliance
with
lingard
'
s
abrupt
demand
almayer
consented
to
wed
the
malay
girl
no
one
knew
that
on
the
day
when
the
interesting
young
convert
had
lost
all
her
natural
relations
and
found
a
white
father
she
had
been
fighting
desperately
like
the
rest
of
them
on
board
the
prau
and
was
only
prevented
from
leaping
overboard
like
the
few
other
survivors
by
a
severe
wound
in
the
leg
there
on
the
fore
-
deck
of
the
prau
old
lingard
found
her
under
a
heap
of
dead
and
dying
pirates
and
had
her
carried
on
the
poop
of
the
flash
before
the
malay
craft
was
set
on
fire
and
sent
adrift
she
was
conscious
and
in
the
great
peace
and
stillness
of
the
tropical
evening
succeeding
the
turmoil
of
the
battle
she
watched
all
she
held
dear
on
earth
after
her
own
savage
manner
drift
away
into
the
gloom
in
a
great
roar
of
flame
and
smoke
she
lay
there
unheeding
the
careful
hands
attending
to
her
wound
silent
and
absorbed
in
gazing
at
the
funeral
pile
of
those
brave
men
she
had
so
much
admired
and
so
well
helped
in
their
contest
with
the
redoubtable
rajah
-
laut
the
light
night
breeze
fanned
the
brig
gently
to
the
southward
and
the
great
blaze
of
light
got
smaller
and
smaller
till
it
twinkled
only
on
the
horizon
like
a
setting
star
it
set
the
heavy
canopy
of
smoke
reflected
the
glare
of
hidden
flames
for
a
short
time
and
then
disappeared
also
she
realised
that
with
this
vanishing
gleam
her
old
life
departed
too
thenceforth
there
was
slavery
in
the
far
countries
amongst
strangers
in
unknown
and
perhaps
terrible
surroundings
being
fourteen
years
old
she
realised
her
position
and
came
to
that
conclusion
the
only
one
possible
to
a
malay
girl
soon
ripened
under
a
tropical
sun
and
not
unaware
of
her
personal
charms
of
which
she
heard
many
a
young
brave
warrior
of
her
father
'
s
crew
express
an
appreciative
admiration
there
was
in
her
the
dread
of
the
unknown
otherwise
she
accepted
her
position
calmly
after
the
manner
of
her
people
and
even
considered
it
quite
natural
for
was
she
not
a
daughter
of
warriors
conquered
in
battle
and
did
she
not
belong
rightfully
to
the
victorious
rajah
even
the
evident
kindness
of
the
terrible
old
man
must
spring
she
thought
from
admiration
for
his
captive
and
the
flattered
vanity
eased
for
her
the
pangs
of
sorrow
after
such
an
awful
calamity
perhaps
had
she
known
of
the
high
walls
the
quiet
gardens
and
the
silent
nuns
of
the
samarang
convent
where
her
destiny
was
leading
her
she
would
have
sought
death
in
her
dread
and
hate
of
such
a
restraint
but
in
imagination
she
pictured
to
herself
the
usual
life
of
a
malay
girl
the
usual
succession
of
heavy
work
and
fierce
love
of
intrigues
gold
ornaments
of
domestic
drudgery
and
of
that
great
but
occult
influence
which
is
one
of
the
few
rights
of
half
-
savage
womankind
but
her
destiny
in
the
rough
hands
of
the
old
sea
-
dog
acting
under
unreasoning
impulses
of
the
heart
took
a
strange
and
to
her
a
terrible
shape
she
bore
it
all
the
restraint
and
the
teaching
and
the
new
faith
with
calm
submission
concealing
her
hate
and
contempt
for
all
that
new
life
she
learned
the
language
very
easily
yet
understood
but
little
of
the
new
faith
the
good
sisters
taught
her
assimilating
quickly
only
the
superstitious
elements
of
the
religion
she
called
lingard
father
gently
and
caressingly
at
each
of
his
short
and
noisy
visits
under
the
clear
impression
that
he
was
a
great
and
dangerous
power
it
was
good
to
propitiate
was
he
not
now
her
master
and
during
those
long
four
years
she
nourished
a
hope
of
finding
favour
in
his
eyes
and
ultimately
becoming
his
wife
counsellor
and
guide
those
dreams
of
the
future
were
dispelled
by
the
rajah
laut
'
s
fiat
which
made
almayer
'
s
fortune
as
that
young
man
fondly
hoped
and
dressed
in
the
hateful
finery
of
europe
the
centre
of
an
interested
circle
of
batavian
society
the
young
convert
stood
before
the
altar
with
an
unknown
and
sulky
-
looking
white
man
for
almayer
was
uneasy
a
little
disgusted
and
greatly
inclined
to
run
away
a
judicious
fear
of
the
adopted
father
-
in
-
law
and
a
just
regard
for
his
own
material
welfare
prevented
him
from
making
a
scandal
yet
while
swearing
fidelity
he
was
concocting
plans
for
getting
rid
of
the
pretty
malay
girl
in
a
more
or
less
distant
future
she
however
had
retained
enough
of
conventual
teaching
to
understand
well
that
according
to
white
men
'
s
laws
she
was
going
to
be
almayer
'
s
companion
and
not
his
slave
and
promised
to
herself
to
act
accordingly
so
when
the
flash
freighted
with
materials
for
building
a
new
house
left
the
harbour
of
batavia
taking
away
the
young
couple
into
the
unknown
borneo
she
did
not
carry
on
her
deck
so
much
love
and
happiness
as
old
lingard
was
wont
to
boast
of
before
his
casual
friends
in
the
verandahs
of
various
hotels
the
old
seaman
himself
was
perfectly
happy
now
he
had
done
his
duty
by
the
girl
you
know
i
made
her
an
orphan
he
often
concluded
solemnly
when
talking
about
his
own
affairs
to
a
scratch
audience
of
shore
loafers
as
it
was
his
habit
to
do
and
the
approbative
shouts
of
his
half
-
intoxicated
auditors
filled
his
simple
soul
with
delight
and
pride
i
carry
everything
right
through
was
another
of
his
sayings
and
in
pursuance
of
that
principle
he
pushed
the
building
of
house
and
godowns
on
the
pantai
river
with
feverish
haste
the
house
for
the
young
couple
the
godowns
for
the
big
trade
almayer
was
going
to
develop
while
he
(
lingard
)
would
be
able
to
give
himself
up
to
some
mysterious
work
which
was
only
spoken
of
in
hints
but
was
understood
to
relate
to
gold
and
diamonds
in
the
interior
of
the
island
almayer
was
impatient
too
had
he
known
what
was
before
him
he
might
not
have
been
so
eager
and
full
of
hope
as
he
stood
watching
the
last
canoe
of
the
lingard
expedition
disappear
in
the
bend
up
the
river
when
turning
round
he
beheld
the
pretty
little
house
the
big
godowns
built
neatly
by
an
army
of
chinese
carpenters
the
new
jetty
round
which
were
clustered
the
trading
canoes
he
felt
a
sudden
elation
in
the
thought
that
the
world
was
his
but
the
world
had
to
be
conquered
first
and
its
conquest
was
not
so
easy
as
he
thought
he
was
very
soon
made
to
understand
that
he
was
not
wanted
in
that
corner
of
it
where
old
lingard
and
his
own
weak
will
placed
him
in
the
midst
of
unscrupulous
intrigues
and
of
a
fierce
trade
competition
the
arabs
had
found
out
the
river
had
established
a
trading
post
in
sambir
and
where
they
traded
they
would
be
masters
and
suffer
no
rival
lingard
returned
unsuccessful
from
his
first
expedition
and
departed
again
spending
all
the
profits
of
the
legitimate
trade
on
his
mysterious
journeys
almayer
struggled
with
the
difficulties
of
his
position
friendless
and
unaided
save
for
the
protection
given
to
him
for
lingard
'
s
sake
by
the
old
rajah
the
predecessor
of
lakamba
lakamba
himself
then
living
as
a
private
individual
on
a
rice
clearing
seven
miles
down
the
river
exercised
all
his
influence
towards
the
help
of
the
white
man
'
s
enemies
plotting
against
the
old
rajah
and
almayer
with
a
certainty
of
combination
pointing
clearly
to
a
profound
knowledge
of
their
most
secret
affairs
outwardly
friendly
his
portly
form
was
often
to
be
seen
on
almayer
'
s
verandah
his
green
turban
and
gold
-
embroidered
jacket
shone
in
the
front
rank
of
the
decorous
throng
of
malays
coming
to
greet
lingard
on
his
returns
from
the
interior
his
salaams
were
of
the
lowest
and
his
hand
-
shakings
of
the
heartiest
when
welcoming
the
old
trader
but
his
small
eyes
took
in
the
signs
of
the
times
and
he
departed
from
those
interviews
with
a
satisfied
and
furtive
smile
to
hold
long
consultations
with
his
friend
and
ally
syed
abdulla
the
chief
of
the
arab
trading
post
a
man
of
great
wealth
and
of
great
influence
in
the
islands
it
was
currently
believed
at
that
time
in
the
settlement
that
lakamba
'
s
visits
to
almayer
'
s
house
were
not
limited
to
those
official
interviews
often
on
moonlight
nights
the
belated
fishermen
of
sambira
saw
a
small
canoe
shooting
out
from
the
narrow
creek
at
the
back
of
the
white
man
'
s
house
and
the
solitary
occupant
paddle
cautiously
down
the
river
in
the
deep
shadows
of
the
bank
and
those
events
duly
reported
were
discussed
round
the
evening
fires
far
into
the
night
with
the
cynicism
of
expression
common
to
aristocratic
malays
and
with
a
malicious
pleasure
in
the
domestic
misfortunes
of
the
orang
blando
the
hated
dutchman
almayer
went
on
struggling
desperately
but
with
a
feebleness
of
purpose
depriving
him
of
all
chance
of
success
against
men
so
unscrupulous
and
resolute
as
his
rivals
the
arabs
the
trade
fell
away
from
the
large
godowns
and
the
godowns
themselves
rotted
piecemeal
the
old
man
'
s
banker
hudig
of
macassar
failed
and
with
this
went
the
whole
available
capital
the
profits
of
past
years
had
been
swallowed
up
in
lingard
'
s
exploring
craze
lingard
was
in
the
interior
perhaps
dead
at
all
events
giving
no
sign
of
life
almayer
stood
alone
in
the
midst
of
those
adverse
circumstances
deriving
only
a
little
comfort
from
the
companionship
of
his
little
daughter
born
two
years
after
the
marriage
and
at
the
time
some
six
years
old
his
wife
had
soon
commenced
to
treat
him
with
a
savage
contempt
expressed
by
sulky
silence
only
occasionally
varied
by
a
flood
of
savage
invective
he
felt
she
hated
him
and
saw
her
jealous
eyes
watching
himself
and
the
child
with
almost
an
expression
of
hate
she
was
jealous
of
the
little
girl
'
s
evident
preference
for
the
father
and
almayer
felt
he
was
not
safe
with
that
woman
in
the
house
while
she
was
burning
the
furniture
and
tearing
down
the
pretty
curtains
in
her
unreasoning
hate
of
those
signs
of
civilisation
almayer
cowed
by
these
outbursts
of
savage
nature
meditated
in
silence
on
the
best
way
of
getting
rid
of
her
he
thought
of
everything
even
planned
murder
in
an
undecided
and
feeble
sort
of
way
but
dared
do
nothing
expecting
every
day
the
return
of
lingard
with
news
of
some
immense
good
fortune
he
returned
indeed
but
aged
ill
a
ghost
of
his
former
self
with
the
fire
of
fever
burning
in
his
sunken
eyes
almost
the
only
survivor
of
the
numerous
expedition
but
he
was
successful
at
last
untold
riches
were
in
his
grasp
he
wanted
more
money
only
a
little
more
torealise
a
dream
of
fabulous
fortune
and
hudig
had
failed
almayer
scraped
all
he
could
together
but
the
old
man
wanted
more
if
almayer
could
not
get
it
he
would
go
to
singapore
to
europe
even
but
before
all
to
singapore
and
he
would
take
the
little
nina
with
him
the
child
must
be
brought
up
decently
he
had
good
friends
in
singapore
who
would
take
care
of
her
and
have
her
taught
properly
all
would
be
well
and
that
girl
upon
whom
the
old
seaman
seemed
to
have
transferred
all
his
former
affection
for
the
mother
would
be
the
richest
woman

gesticulating
with

smouldering
cheroot
ragged
dishevelled
enthusiastic
and
almayer
sitting
huddled
up
on
a
pile
of
mats
thought
with
dread
of
the
separation
with
the
only
human
being
he
loved
with
greater
dread
still
perhaps
of
the
scene
with
his
wife
the
savage
tigress
deprived
of
her
young
she
will
poison
me
thought
the
poor
wretch
well
aware
of
that
easy
and
final
manner
of
solving
the
social
political
or
family
problems
in
malay
life
to
his
great
surprise
she
took
the
news
very
quietly
giving
only
him
and
lingard
a
furtive
glance
and
saying
not
a
word
this
however
did
not
prevent
her
the
next
day
from
jumping
into
the
river
and
swimming
after
the
boat
in
which
lingard
was
carrying
away
the
nurse
with
the
screaming
child

had
to
give

boat
and
drag
her
in
by
the
hair
in
the
midst
of
cries
and
curses
enough
to
make
heaven
fall
yet
after
two
days
spent
in
wailing
she
returned
to
her
former
mode
of
life
chewing
betel
-
nut
and
sitting
all
day
amongst
her
women
in
stupefied
idleness
she
aged
very
rapidly
after
that
and
only
roused
herself
from
her
apathy
to
acknowledge
by
a
scathing
remark
or
an
insulting
exclamation
the
accidental
presence
of
her
husband
he
had
built
for
her
a
riverside
hut
in
the
compound
where
she
dwelt
in
perfect
seclusion
lakamba
'
s
visits
had
ceased
when
by
a
convenient
decree
of
providence
and
the
help
of
a
little
scientific
manipulation
the
old
ruler
of
sambir
departed
this
life

reigned
in
his
stead
now
having
been
well
served
by
his
arab
friends
with
the
dutch
authorities
syed
abdulla
was
the
great
man
and
trader
of
the
pantai
almayer
lay
ruined
and
helpless
under
the
close
-
meshed
net
of
their
intrigues
owing
his
life
only
to
his
supposed
knowledge
of
lingard
'
s
valuable
secret
lingard
had
disappeared
he
wrote
once
from
singapore
saying
the
child
was
well
and
under
the
care
of
a
mrs
vinck
and
that
he
himself
was
going
to
europe
to
raise
money
for
the
great
enterprise
he
was
coming
back
soon
there
would
be
no
difficulties
he
wrote
people
would
rush
in
with
their
money
evidently
they
did
not
for
there
was
only
one
letter
more
from
him
saying
he
was
ill
had
found
no
relation
living
but
little
else
besides
then
came
a
complete
silence
europe
had
swallowed
up
the
rajah
laut
apparently
and
almayer
looked
vainly
westward
for
a
ray
of
light
out
of
the
gloom
of
his
shattered
hopes
years
passed
and
the
rare
letters
from

on
from

were
the

to
to

bearable

triumphant
savagery
of

now
alone

to
visit

would
not
pay

of

protection
the
faithful
sumatrese

cooked
his
rice
and
made
his
coffee
for
he
dared
not
trust
any
one
else
and
least
of
all
his
wife
he
killed
time
wandering
sadly
in
the
overgrown
paths
round
the
house
visiting
the
ruined
godowns
where
a
few
brass
guns
covered
with
verdigris
and
only
a
few
broken
cases
of
mouldering
manchester
goods
reminded
him
of
the
good
early
times
when
all
this
was
full
of
life
and
merchandise
and
he
overlooked
a
busy
scene
on
the
river
bank
his
little
daughter
by
his
side
now

up

country
canoes
glided
past
the
little
rotten
wharf
of
lingard

co
to
paddle
up
the
pantai
branch
and
cluster
round
the
new
jetty
belonging
to
abdulla
not
that
they
loved
abdulla
but
they
dared
not
trade
with
the
man
whose
star
had
set
had
they
done
so
they
knew
there
was
no
mercy
to
be
expected
from
arab
or
rajah
no
rice
to
be
got
on
credit
in
the
times
of

from
either
and
almayer
could
not
help
them
having
at
times
hardly
enough
for
himself
almayer
in
his
isolation
and
despair
often
envied
his
near
neighbour

chinaman

he
could
see
stretched
on
a
pile
of
cool
mats

wooden
pillow
under

opium
pipe
in
his
nerveless
fingers
he
did
not
seek
however
consolation
in
opium
perhaps
it
was
too
expensive
perhaps
his
white
man
'
s
pride
saved
him
from
that
degradation
but
most
likely
it
was
the
thought
of
his
little
daughter
in
the
far
-
off
straits
settlements
he
heard
from
her
oftener
since
abdulla
bought
a
steamer
which
ran
now
between
singapore
and
the
pantai
settlement
every
three
months
or
so
almayer
felt
himself
nearer
his
daughter
he
longed
to
see
her
and
planned
a
voyage
to
singapore
but
put
off
his
departure
from
year
to
year
always
expecting
some
favourable
turn
of
fortune
he
did
not
want
to
meet
her
with
empty
hands
and
with
no
words
of
hope
on
his
lips
he
could
not
take
her
back
into
that
savage
life
to
which
he
was
condemned
himself
he
was
also
a
little
afraid
of
her
what
would
she
think
of
him
he
reckoned
the
years
a
grown
woman
a
civilised
woman
young
and
hopeful
while
he
felt
old
and
hopeless
and
very
much
like
those
savages
round
him
he
asked
himself
what
was
going
to
be
her
future
he
could
not
answer
that
question
yet
and
he
dared
not
face
her
and
yet
he
longed
after
her
he
hesitated
for
years
his
hesitation
was
put
an
end
to
by
nina
'
s
unexpected
appearance
in
sambir
she
arrived
in
the
steamer
under
the
captain
'
s
care
almayer
beheld
her
with
surprise
not
unmixed
with
wonder
during
those
ten
years
the
child
had
changed
into
a
woman
black
-
haired
olive
-
skinned
tall
and
beautiful
with
great
sad
eyes
where
the
startled
expression
common
to
malay
womankind
was
modified
by
a
thoughtful
tinge
inherited
from
her
european
ancestry
almayer
thought
with
dismay
of
the
meeting
of
his
wife
and
daughter
of
what
this
grave
girl
in
european
clothes
would
think
of
her
betel
-
nut
chewing
mother
squatting
in
a
dark
hut
disorderly
half
naked
and
sulky
he
also
feared
an
outbreak
of
temper
on
the
part
of
that
pest
of
a
woman
he
had
hitherto
managed
to
keep
tolerably
quiet
thereby
saving
the
remnants
of
his
dilapidated
furniture
and
he
stood
there
before
the
closed
door
of
the
hut
in
the
blazing
sunshine
listening
to
the
murmur
of
voices
wondering
what
went
on
inside
wherefrom
all
the
servant
-
maids
had
been
expelled
at
the
beginning
of
the
interview
and
now
stood
clustered
by
the
palings
with
half
-
covered
faces
in
a
chatter
of
curious
speculation
he
forgot
himself
there
trying
to
catch
a
stray
word
through
the
bamboo
walls
till
the
captain
of
the
steamer
who
had
walked
up
with
the
girl
fearing
a
sunstroke
took
him
under
the
arm
and
led
him
into
the
shade
of
his
own
verandah
where
nina
'
s
trunk
stood
already
having
been
landed
by
the
steamer
'
s
men
as
soon
as
captain
ford
had
his
glass
before
him
and
his
cheroot
lighted
almayer
asked
for
the
explanation
of
his
daughter
'
s
unexpected
arrival
ford
said
little
beyond
generalising
in
vague
but
violent
terms
upon
the
foolishness
of
women
in
general
and
of
mrs
vinck
in
particular
you
know
kaspar
said
he
in
conclusion
to
the
excited
almayer
it
is
deucedly
awkward
to
have
a
half
-
caste
girl
in
the
house
there
'
s
such
a
lot
of
fools
about
there
was
that
young
fellow
from
the
bank
who
used
to
ride
to
the
vinck
bungalow
early
and
late
that
old
woman
thought
it
was
for
that
emma
of
hers
when
she
found
out
what
he
wanted
exactly
there
was
a
row
i
can
tell
you
she
would
not
have
nina
not
an
hour
longer
in
the
house
fact
is
i
heard
of
this
affair
and
took
the
girl
to
my
wife
my
wife
is
a
pretty
good
woman
as
women
go
and
upon
my
word
we
would
have
kept
the
girl
for
you
only
she
would
not
stay
now
then
do
not
flare
up
kaspar
sit
still
what
can
you
do
it
is
better
so
let
her
stay
with
you
she
was
never
happy
over
there
those
two
vinck
girls
are
no
better
than
dressed
-
up
monkeys
they
slighted
her
you
ca
not
make
her
white
it
is
no
use
you
swearing
at
me
you
ca
not
she
is
a
good
girl
for
all
that
but
she
would
not
tell
my
wife
anything
if
you
want
to
know
ask
her
yourself
but
if
i
was
you
i
would
leave
her
alone
you
are
welcome
to
her
passage
money
old
fellow
if
you
are
short
now
and
the
skipper
throwing
away
his
cigar
walked
off
to
wake
them
up
on
board
as
he
expressed
it
almayer
vainly
expected
to
hear
of
the
cause
of
his
daughter
'
s
return
from
his
daughter
'
s
lips
not
that
day
not
on
any
other
day
did
she
ever
allude
to
her
singapore
life
he
did
not
care
to
ask
awed
by
the
calm
impassiveness
of
her
face
by
those
solemn
eyes
looking
past
him
on
the
great
still
forests
sleeping
in
majestic
repose
to
the
murmur
of
the
broad
river
he
accepted
the
situation
happy
in
the
gentle
and
protecting
affection
the
girl
showed
him
fitfully
enough
for
she
had
as
she
called
it
her
bad
days
when
she
used
to
visit
her
mother
and
remain
long
hours
in
the
riverside
hut
coming
out
as
inscrutable
as
ever
but
with
a
contemptuous
look
and
a
short
word
ready
to
answer
any
of
his
speeches
he
got
used
even
to
that
and
on
those
days
kept
quiet
although
greatly
alarmed
by
his
wife
'
s
influence
upon
the
girl
otherwise
nina
adapted
herself
wonderfully
to
the
circumstances
of
a
half
-
savage
and
miserable
life
she
accepted
without
question
or
apparent
disgust
the
neglect
the
decay
the
poverty
of
the
household
the
absence
of
furniture
and
the
preponderance
of
rice
diet
on
the
family
table
she
lived
with
almayer
in
the
little
house
(
now
sadly
decaying
)
built
originally
by
lingard
for
the
young
couple
the
malays
eagerly
discussed
her
arrival
there
were
at
the
beginning
crowded
levees
of
malay
women
with
their
children
seeking
eagerly
after
ubat
for
all
the
ills
of
the
flesh
from
the
young
mem
putih
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
grave
arabs
in
long
white
shirts
and
yellow
sleeveless
jackets
walked
slowly
on
the
dusty
path
by
the
riverside
towards
almayer
'
s
gate
and
made
solemn
calls
upon
that
unbeliever
under
shallow
pretences
of
business
only
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
young
girl
in
a
highly
decorous
manner
even
lakamba
came
out
of
his
stockade
in
a
great
pomp
of
war
canoes
and
red
umbrellas
and
landed
on
the
rotten
little
jetty
of
lingard
and
co
he
came
he
said
to
buy
a
couple
of
brass
guns
as
a
present
to
his
friend
the
chief
of
sambir
dyaks
and
while
almayer
suspicious
but
polite
busied
himself
in
unearthing
the
old
popguns
in
the
godowns
the
rajah
sat
on
an
armchair
in
the
verandah
surrounded
by
his
respectful
retinue
waiting
in
vain
for
nina
'
s
appearance
she
was
in
one
of
her
bad
days
and
remained
in
her
mother
'
s
hut
watching
with
her
the
ceremonious
proceedings
on
the
verandah
the
rajah
departed
baffled
but
courteous
and
soon
almayer
began
to
reap
the
benefit
of
improved
relations
with
the
ruler
in
the
shape
of
the
recovery
of
some
debts
paid
to
him
with
many
apologies
and
many
a
low
salaam
by
debtors
till
then
considered
hopelessly
insolvent
under
these
improving
circumstances
almayer
brightened
up
a
little
all
was
not
lost
perhaps
those
arabs
and
malays
saw
at
last
that
he
was
a
man
of
some
ability
he
thought
and
he
began
after
his
manner
to
plan
great
things
to
dream
of
great
fortunes
for
himself
and
nina
especially
for
nina
under
these
vivifying
impulses
he
asked
captain
ford
to
write
to
his
friends
in
england
making
inquiries
after
lingard
was
he
alive
or
dead
if
dead
had
he
left
any
papers
documents
any
indications
or
hints
as
to
his
great
enterprise
meantime
he
had
found
amongst
the
rubbish
in
one
of
the
empty
rooms
a
note
-
book
belonging
to
the
old
adventurer
he
studied
the
crabbed
handwriting
of
its
pages
and
often
grew
meditative
over
it
other
things
also
woke
him
up
from
his
apathy
the
stir
made
in
the
whole
of
the
island
by
the
establishment
of
the
british
borneo
company
affected
even
the
sluggish
flow
of
the
pantai
life
great
changes
were
expected
annexation
was
talked
of
the
arabs
grew
civil
almayer
began
building
his
new
house
for
the
use
of
the
future
engineers
agents
or
settlers
of
the
new
company
he
spent
every
available
guilder
on
it
with
a
confiding
heart
one
thing
only
disturbed
his
happiness
his
wife
came
out
of
her
seclusion
importing
her
green
jacket
scant
sarongs
shrill
voice
and
witch
-
like
appearance
into
his
quiet
life
in
the
small
bungalow
and
his
daughter
seemed
to
accept
that
savage
intrusion
into
their
daily
existence
with
wonderful
equanimity
he
did
not
like
it
but
dared
say
nothing
the
deliberations
conducted
in
london
have
a
far
-
reaching
importance
and
so
the
decision
issued
from
the
fog
-
veiled
offices
of
the
borneo
company
darkened
for
almayer
the
brilliant
sunshine
of
the
tropics
and
added
another
drop
of
bitterness
to
the
cup
of
his
disenchantments
the
claim
to
that
part
of
the
east
coast
was
abandoned
leaving
the
pantai
river
under
the
nominal
power
of
holland
in
sambir
there
was
joy
and
excitement
the
slaves
were
hurried
out
of
sight
into
the
forest
and
jungle
and
the
flags
were
run
up
to
tall
poles
in
the
rajah
'
s
compound
in
expectation
of
a
visit
from
dutch

of

war
boats
the
frigate
remained
anchored
outside
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
the
boats
came
up
in
tow
of
the
steam
launch
threading
their
way
cautiously
amongst
a
crowd
of
canoes
filled
with
gaily
dressed
malays
the
officer
in
command
listened
gravely
to
the
loyal
speeches
of
lakamba
returned
the
salaams
of
abdulla
and
assured
those
gentlemen
in
choice
malay
of
the
great

'

down

batavia
friendship
and
goodwill
towards
the
ruler
and
inhabitants
of
this
model
state
of
sambir
almayer
from
his
verandah
watched
across
the
river
the
festive
proceedings
heard
the
report
of
brass
guns
saluting
the
new
flag
presented
to
lakamba
and
the
deep
murmur
of
the
crowd
of
spectators
surging
round
the
stockade
the
smoke
of
the
firing
rose
in
white
clouds
on
the
green
background
of
the
forests
and
he
could
not
help
comparing
his
own
fleeting
hopes
to
the
rapidly
disappearing
vapour
he
was
by
no
means
patriotically
elated
by
the
event
yet
he
had
to
force
himself
into
a
gracious
behaviour
when
the
official
reception
being
over
the
naval
officers
of
the
commission
crossed
the
river
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
solitary
white
man
of
whom
they
had
heard
no
doubt
wishing
also
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
daughter
in
that
they
were
disappointed
nina
refusing
to
show
herself
but
they
seemed
easily
consoled
by
the
gin
and
cheroots
set
before
them
by
the
hospitable
almayer
and
sprawling
comfortably
on
the
lame
armchairs
under
the
shade
of
the
verandah
while
the
blazing
sunshine
outside
seemed
to
set
the
great
river
simmering
in
the
heat
they
filled
the
little
bungalow
with
the
unusual
sounds
of
european
languages
with
noise
and
laughter
produced
by
naval
witticisms
at
the
expense
of
the
fat
lakamba
whom
they
had
been
complimenting
so
much
that
very
morning
the
younger
men
in
an
access
of
good
fellowship
made
their
host
talk
and
almayer
excited
by
the
sight
of
european
faces
by
the
sound
of
european
voices
opened
his
heart
before
the
sympathising
strangers
unaware
of
the
amusement
the
recital
of
his
many
misfortunes
caused
to
those
future
admirals
they
drank
his
health
wished
him
many
big
diamonds
and
a
mountain
of
gold
expressed
even
an
envy
of
the
high
destinies
awaiting
him
yet
encouraged
by
so
much
friendliness
the
grey
-
headed
and
foolish
dreamer
invited
his
guests
to
visit
his
new
house
they
went
there
through
the
long
grass
in
a
straggling
procession
while
their
boats
were
got
ready
for
the
return
down
the
river
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
and
in
the
great
empty
rooms
where
the
tepid
wind
entering
through
the
sashless
windows
whirled
gently
the
dried
leaves
and
the
dust
of
many
days
of
neglect
almayer
in
his
white
jacket
and
flowered
sarong
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
glittering
uniforms
stamped
his
foot
to
show
the
solidity
of
the
neatly
-
fitting
floors
and
expatiated
upon
the
beauties
and
convenience
of
the
building
they
listened
and
assented
amazed
by
the
wonderful
simplicity
and
the
foolish
hopefulness
of
the
man
till
almayer
carried
away
by
his
excitement
disclosed
his
regret
at
the
non
-
arrival
of
the
english
who
knew
how
to
develop
a
rich
country
as
he
expressed
it
there
was
a
general
laugh
amongst
the
dutch
officers
at
that
unsophisticated
statement
and
a
move
was
made
towards
the
boats
but
when
almayer
stepping
cautiously
on
the
rotten
boards
of
the
lingard
jetty
tried
to
approach
the
chief
of
the
commission
with
some
timid
hints
anent
the
protection
required
by
the
dutch
subject
against
the
wily
arabs
that
salt
water
diplomat
told
him
significantly
that
the
arabs
were
better
subjects
than
hollanders
who
dealt
illegally
in
gunpowder
with
the
malays
the
innocent
almayer
recognised
there
at
once
the
oily
tongue
of
abdulla
and
the
solemn
persuasiveness
of
lakamba
but
ere
he
had
time
to
frame
an
indignant
protest
the
steam
launch
and
the
string
of
boats
moved
rapidly
down
the
river
leaving
him
on
the
jetty
standing
open
-
mouthed
in
his
surprise
and
anger
there
are
thirty
miles
of
river
from
sambir
to
the
gem
-
like
islands
of
the
estuary
where
the
frigate
was
awaiting
the
return
of
the
boats
the
moon
rose
long
before
the
boats
had
traversed
half
that
distance
and
the
black
forest
sleeping
peacefully
under
her
cold
rays
woke
up
that
night
to
the
ringing
laughter
in
the
small
flotilla
provoked
by
some
reminiscence
of
almayer
'
s
lamentable
narrative
salt

water
jests
at
the
poor
man

s
expense
were
passed
from

to
boat
the
non

appearance
of
his
daughter
was
commented
upon
with
severe
displeasure
and
the
half
-
finished
house
built
for
the
reception
of
englishmen
received
on
that
joyous
night
the
name
of

folly
by
the
unanimous
vote
of
the
lighthearted
seamen
for
many
weeks
after

its
even
and
uneventful
flow

the

lolling
on

shady
side
of

houses
on

high
platforms
of

busily
engaged
in

strolling
before

house
greeted
her
with
a
friendly
nod
before
climbing
up
indoors
to
seek
his
beloved
opium
pipe
the
elder
children
clustered
round
her
daring
from
long
acquaintance
pulling
the
skirts
of
her
white
robe
with
their
dark
fingers
and
showing
their
brilliant
teeth
in
expectation
of
a
shower
of
glass
beads
she
greeted
them
with
a
quiet
smile
but
always
had
a
few
friendly
words
for
a
siamese
girl
a
slave
owned
by
bulangi
whose
numerous
wives
were
said
to
be
of
a
violent
temper
well
-
founded
rumour
said
also
that
the
domestic
squabbles
of
that
industrious
cultivator
ended
generally
in
a
combined
assault
of
all
his
wives
upon
the
siamese
slave
the
girl
herself
never
complained
perhaps
from
dictates
of
prudence
but
more
likely
through
the
strange
resigned
apathy
of
half
-
savage
womankind
from
early
morning
she
was
to
be
seen
on
the
paths
amongst
the
houses
by
the
riverside
or
on
the
jetties
the
tray
of
pastry
it
was
her
mission
to
sell
skilfully
balanced
on
her
head
during
the
great
heat
of
the
day
she
usually
sought
refuge
in
almayer
'
s
campong
often
finding
shelter
in
a
shady
corner
of
the
verandah
where
she
squatted
with
her
tray
before
her
when
invited
by
nina
for
mem
putih
she
had
always
a
smile
but
the
presence
of
mrs
almayer
the
very
sound
of
her
shrill
voice
was
the
signal
for
a
hurried
departure
to
this
girl
nina
often
spoke
the
other
inhabitants
of
sambir
seldom
or
never
heard
the
sound
of
her
voice
they
got
used
to
the
silent
figure
moving
in
their
midst
calm
and
white
-
robed
a
being
from
another
world
and
incomprehensible
to
them
yet
nina
'
s
life
for
all
her
outward
composure
for
all
the
seeming
detachment
from
the
things
and
people
surrounding
her
was
far
from
quiet
in
consequence
of
mrs
almayer
being
much
too
active
for
the
happiness
and
even
safety
of
the
household
she
had
resumed
some
intercourse
with
lakamba
not
personally
it
is
true
(
for
the
dignity
of
that
potentate
kept
him
inside
his
stockade
)
but
through
the
agency
of
that
potentate
'
s
prime
minister
harbour
master
financial
adviser
and
general
factotum
that
gentleman
of
sulu
origin
was
certainly
endowed
with
statesmanlike
qualities
although
he
was
totally
devoid
of
personal
charms
in
truth
he
was
perfectly
repulsive
possessing
only
one
eye
and
a
pockmarked
face
with
nose
and
lips
horribly
disfigured
by
the
small
-
pox
this
unengaging
individual
often
strolled
into
almayer
'
s
garden
in
unofficial
costume
composed
of
a
piece
of
pink
calico
round
his
waist
there
at
the
back
of
the
house
squatting
on
his
heels
on
scattered
embers
in
close
proximity
to
the
great
iron
boiler
where
the
family
daily
rice
was
being
cooked
by
the
women
under
mrs
almayer
'
s
superintendence
did
that
astute
negotiator
carry
on
long
conversations
in
sulu
language
with
almayer
'
s
wife
what
the
subject
of
their
discourses
was
might
have
been
guessed
from
the
subsequent
domestic
scenes
by
almayer
'
s
hearthstone
of
late
almayer
had
taken
to
excursions
up
the
river
in
a
small
canoe
with
two
paddlers
and
the
faithful
ali
for
a
steersman
he
would
disappear
for
a
few
days
at
a
time
all
his
movements
were
no
doubt
closely
watched
by
lakamba
and
abdulla
for
the
man
once
in
the
confidence
of
rajah
laut
was
supposed
to
be
in
possession
of
valuable
secrets
the
coast
population
of
borneo
believes
implicitly
in
diamonds
of
fabulous
value
in
gold
mines
of
enormous
richness
in
the
interior
and
all
those
imaginings
are
heightened
by
the
difficulty
of
penetrating
far
inland
especially
on
the
north
-
east
coast
where
the
malays
and
the
river
tribes
of
dyaks
or
head
-
hunters
are
eternally
quarrelling
it
is
true
enough
that
some
gold
reaches
the
coast
in
the
hands
of
those
dyaks
when
during
short
periods
of
truce
in
the
desultory
warfare
they
visit
the
coast
settlements
of
malays
and
so
the
wildest
exaggerations
are
built
up
and
added
to
on
the
slight
basis
of
that
fact
almayer
in
his
quality
of
white
man
as
lingard
before
him
had
somewhat
better
relations
with
the
up
-
river
tribes
yet
even
his
excursions
were
not
without
danger
and
his
returns
were
eagerly
looked
for
by
the
impatient
lakamba
but
every
time
the
rajah
was
disappointed
vain
were
the
conferences
by
the
rice
-
pot
of
his
factotum
babalatchi
with
the
white
man
'
s
wife
the
white
man
himself
was
impenetrable
impenetrable
to
persuasion
coaxing
abuse
to
soft
words
and
shrill
revilings
to
desperate
beseechings
or
murderous
threats
for
mrs
almayer
in
her
extreme
desire
to
persuade
her
husband
into
an
alliance
with
lakamba
played
upon
the
whole
gamut
of
passion
with
her
soiled
robe
wound
tightly
under
the
armpits
across
her
lean
bosom
her
scant
grayish
hair
tumbled
in
disorder
over
her
projecting
cheek
-
bones
in
suppliant
attitude
she
depicted
with
shrill
volubility
the
advantages
of
close
union
with
a
man
so
good
and
so
fair
dealing
why
do
not
you
go
to
the
rajah
she
screamed
why
do
you
go
back
to
those
dyaks
in
the
great
forest
they
should
be
killed
you
cannot
kill
them
you
cannot
but
our
rajah
'
s
men
are
brave
you
tell
the
rajah
where
the
old
white

is

will
kill

you
shall
have

tell
me
out
of
the
old
man
'
s
surat
where
you
read
so
often
at
night
on
those
occasions
almayer
sat
with
rounded
shoulders
bending
to
the
blast
of
this
domestic
tempest
accentuating
only
each
pause
in
the
torrent
of
his
wife
'
s
eloquence
by
an
angry
growl
there
is
no
treasure
go
away
woman
exasperated
by
the
sight
of
his
patiently
bent
back
she
would
at
last
walk
round
so
as
to
face
him
across
the
table
and
clasping
her
robe
with
one
hand
she
stretched
the
other
lean
arm
and
claw
-
like
hand
to
emphasise
in
a
passion
of
anger
and
contempt
the
rapid
rush
of
scathing
remarks
and
bitter
cursings
heaped
on
the
head
of
the
man
unworthy
to
associate
with
brave
malay
chiefs
it
ended
generally
by
almayer
rising
slowly
his
long
pipe
in
hand
his
face
set
into
a
look
of
inward
pain
and
walking
away
in
silence
he
descended
the
steps
and
plunged
into
the
long
grass
on
his
way
to
the
solitude
of
his
new
house
dragging
his
feet
in
a
state
of
physical
collapse
from
disgust
and
fear
before
that
fury
she
followed
to
the
head
of
the
steps
and
sent
the
shafts
of
indiscriminate
abuse
after
the
retreating
form
and
each
of
those
scenes
was
concluded
by
a
piercing
shriek
reaching
him
far
away
you
know
kaspar
i
am
your
wife
your
own
christian
wife
after
your
own
blanda
law
for
she
knew
that
this
was
the
bitterest
thing
of
all
the
greatest
regret
of
that
man
'
s
life
all
these
scenes
nina
witnessed
unmoved
she
might
have
been
deaf
dumb
without
any
feeling
as
far
as
any
expression
of
opinion
went
yet
oft
when
her
father
had
sought
the
refuge
of
the
great
dusty
rooms
of
almayer
'
s
folly
and
her
mother
exhausted
by
rhetorical
efforts
squatted
wearily
on
her
heels
with
her
back
against
the
leg
of
the
table
nina
would
approach
her
curiously
guarding
her
skirts
from
betel
juice
besprinkling
the
floor
and
gaze
down
upon
her
as
one
might
look
into
the
quiescent
crater
of
a
volcano
after
a
destructive
eruption
mrs
almayer
'
s
thoughts
after
these
scenes
were
usually
turned
into
a
channel
of
childhood
reminiscences
and
she
gave
them
utterance
in
a
kind
of
monotonous
recitative
slightly
disconnected
but
generally
describing
the
glories
of
the
sultan
of
sulu
his
great
splendour
his
power
his
great
prowess
the
fear
which
benumbed
the
hearts
of
white
men
at
the
sight
of
his
swift
piratical
praus
and
these
muttered
statements
of
her
grandfather
'
s
might
were
mixed
up
with
bits
of
later
recollections
where
the
great
fight
with
the
white
devil
'
s
brig
and
the
convent
life
in
samarang
occupied
the
principal
place
at
that
point
she
usually
dropped
the
thread
of
her
narrative
and
pulling
out
the
little
brass
cross
always
suspended
round
her
neck
she
contemplated
it
with
superstitious
awe
that
superstitious
feeling
connected
with
some
vague
talismanic
properties
of
the
little
bit
of
metal
and
the
still
more
hazy
but
terrible
notion
of
some
bad
djinns
and
horrible
torments
invented
as
she
thought
for
her
especial
punishment
by
the
good
mother
superior
in
case
of
the
loss
of
the
above
charm
were
mrs
almayer
'
s
only
theological
luggage
for
the
stormy
road
of
life
mrs
almayer
had
at
least
something
tangible
to
cling
to
but
nina
brought
up
under
the
protestant
wing
of
the
proper
mrs
vinck
had
not
even
a
little
piece
of
brass
to
remind
her
of
past
teaching
and
listening
to
the
recital
of
those
savage
glories
those
barbarous
fights
and
savage
feasting
to
the
story
of
deeds
valorous
albeit
somewhat
bloodthirsty
where
men
of
her
mother
'
s
race
shone
far
above
the
orang
blanda
she
felt
herself
irresistibly
fascinated
and
saw
with
vague
surprise
the
narrow
mantle
of
civilised
morality
in
which
good
-
meaning
people
had
wrapped
her
young
soul
fall
away
and
leave
her
shivering
and
helpless
as
if
on
the
edge
of
some
deep
and
unknown
abyss
strangest
of
all
this
abyss
did
not
frighten
her
when
she
was
under
the
influence
of
the
witch
-
like
being
she
called
her
mother
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
in
civilised
surroundings
her
life
before
the
time
when
lingard
had
so
to
speak
kidnapped
her
from
brow
since
then
she
had
had
christian
teaching
social
education
and
a
good
glimpse
of
civilised
life
unfortunately
her
teachers
did
not
understand
her
nature
and
the
education
ended
in
a
scene
of
humiliation
in
an
outburst
of
contempt
from
white
people
for
her
mixed
blood
she
had
tasted
the
whole
bitterness
of
it
and
remembered
distinctly
that
the
virtuous
mrs
vinck
'
s
indignation
was
not
so
much
directed
against
the
young
man
from
the
bank
as
against
the
innocent
cause
of
that
young
man
'
s
infatuation
and
there
was
also
no
doubt
in
her
mind
that
the
principal
cause
of
mrs
vinck
'
s
indignation
was
the
thought
that
such
a
thing
should
happen
in
a
white
nest
where
her
snow
-
white
doves
the
two
misses
vinck
had
just
returned
from
europe
to
find
shelter
under
the
maternal
wing
and
there
await
the
coming
of
irreproachable
men
of
their
destiny
not
even
the
thought
of
the
money
so
painfully
scraped
together
by
almayer
and
so
punctually
sent
for
nina
'
s
expenses
could
dissuade
mrs
vinck
from
her
virtuous
resolve
nina
was
sent
away
and
in
truth
the
girl
herself
wanted
to
go
although
a
little
frightened
by
the
impending
change
and
now
she
had
lived
on
the
river
for
three
years
with
a
savage
mother
and
a
father
walking
about
amongst
pitfalls
with
his
head
in
the
clouds
weak
irresolute
and
unhappy
she
had
lived
a
life
devoid
of
all
the
decencies
of
civilisation
in
miserable
domestic
conditions
she
had
breathed
in
the
atmosphere
of
sordid
plottings
for
gain
of
the
no
less
disgusting
intrigues
and
crimes
for
lust
or
money
and
those
things
together
with
the
domestic
quarrels
were
the
only
events
of
her
three
years
'
existence
she
did
not
die
from
despair
and
disgust
the
first
month
as
she
expected
and
almost
hoped
for
on
the
contrary
at
the
end
of
half
a
year
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
known
no
other
life
her
young
mind
having
been
unskilfully
permitted
to
glance
at
better
things
and
then
thrown
back
again
into
the
hopeless
quagmire
of
barbarism
full
of
strong
and
uncontrolled
passions
had
lost
the
power
to
discriminate
it
seemed
to
nina
that
there
was
no
change
and
no
difference
whether
they
traded
in
brick
godowns
or
on
the
muddy
river
bank
whether
they
reached
after
much
or
little
whether
they
made
love
under
the
shadows
of
the
great
trees
or
in
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
on
the
singapore
promenade
whether
they
plotted
for
their
own
ends
under
the
protection
of
laws
and
according
to
the
rules
of
christian
conduct
or
whether
they
sought
the
gratification
of
their
desires
with
the
savage
cunning
and
the
unrestrained
fierceness
of
natures
as
innocent
of
culture
as
their
own
immense
and
gloomy
forests
nina
saw
only
the
same
manifestations
of
love
and
hate
and
of
sordid
greed
chasing
the
uncertain
dollar
in
all
its
multifarious
and
vanishing
shapes
to
her
resolute
nature
however
after
all
these
years
the
savage
and
uncompromising
sincerity
of
purpose
shown
by
her
malay
kinsmen
seemed
at
last
preferable
to
the
sleek
hypocrisy
to
the
polite
disguises
to
the
virtuous
pretences
of
such
white
people
as
she
had
had
the
misfortune
to
come
in
contact
with
after
all
it
was
her
life
it
was
going
to
be
her
life
and
so
thinking
she
fell
more
and
more
under
the
influence
of
her
mother
seeking
in
her
ignorance
a
better
side
to
that
life
she
listened
with
avidity
to
the
old
woman
'
s
tales
of
the
departed
glories
of
the
rajahs
from
whose
race
she
had
sprung
and
she
became
gradually
more
indifferent
more
contemptuous
of
the
white
side
of
her
descent
represented
by
a
feeble
and
traditionless
father
almayer
'
s
difficulties
were
by
no
means
diminished
by
the
girl
'
s
presence
in
sambir
the
stir
caused
by
her
arrival
had
died
out
it
is
true
and
lakamba
had
not
renewed
his
visits
but
about
a
year
after
the
departure
of
the
man
-
of
-
war
boats
the
nephew
of
abdulla
syed
reshid
returned
from
his
pilgrimage
to
mecca
rejoicing
in
a
green
jacket
and
the
proud
title
of
hadji
there
was
a
great
letting
off
of
rockets
on
board
the
steamer
which
brought
him
in
and
a
great
beating
of
drums
all
night
in
abdulla
'
s
compound
while
the
feast
of
welcome
was
prolonged
far
into
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
reshid
was
the
favourite
nephew
and
heir
of
abdulla
and
that
loving
uncle
meeting
almayer
one
day
by
the
riverside
stopped
politely
to
exchange
civilities
and
to
ask
solemnly
for
an
interview
almayer
suspected
some
attempt
at
a
swindle
or
at
any
rate
something
unpleasant
but
of
course
consented
with
a
great
show
of
rejoicing
accordingly
the
next
evening
after
sunset
abdulla
came
accompanied
by
several
other
grey
-
beards
and
by
his
nephew
that
young
man
of
a
very
rakish
and
dissipated
appearance
affected
the
greatest
indifference
as
to
the
whole
of
the
proceedings
when
the
torch
-
bearers
had
grouped
themselves
below
the
steps
and
the
visitors
had
seated
themselves
on
various
lame
chairs
reshid
stood
apart
in
the
shadow
examining
his
aristocratically
small
hands
with
great
attention
almayer
surprised
by
the
great
solemnity
of
his
visitors
perched
himself
on
the
corner
of
the
table
with
a
characteristic
want
of
dignity
quickly
noted
by
the
arabs
with
grave
disapproval
but
abdulla
spoke
now
looking
straight
past
almayer
at
the
red
curtain
hanging
in
the
doorway
where
a
slight
tremor
disclosed
the
presence
of
women
on
the
other
side
he
began
by
neatly
complimenting
almayer
upon
the
long
years
they
had
dwelt
together
in
cordial
neighbourhood
and
called
upon
allah
to
give
him
many
more
years
to
gladden
the
eyes
of
his
friends
by
his
welcome
presence
he
made
a
polite
allusion
to
the
great
consideration
shown
him
(
almayer
)
by
the
dutch
commissie
and
drew
thence
the
flattering
inference
of
almayer
'
s
great
importance
amongst
his
own
people
he
abdulla
was
also
important
amongst
all
the
arabs
and
his
nephew
reshid
would
be
heir
of
that
social
position
and
of
great
riches
now
reshid
was
a
hadji
he
was
possessor
of
several
malay
women
went
on
abdulla
but
it
was
time
he
had
a
favourite
wife
the
first
of
the
four
allowed
by
the
prophet
and
speaking
with
well
-
bred
politeness
he
explained
further
to
the
dumbfounded
almayer
that
if
he
would
consent
to
the
alliance
of
his
offspring
with
that
true
believer
and
virtuous
man
reshid
she
would
be
the
mistress
of
all
the
splendours
of
reshid
'
s
house
and
first
wife
of
the
first
arab
in
the
islands
when
he
abdulla
was
called
to
the
joys
of
paradise
by
allah
the
all
-
merciful
you
know
tuan
he
said
in
conclusion
the
other
women
would
be
her
slaves
and
reshid
'
s
house
is
great
from
bombay
he
has
brought
great
divans
and
costly
carpets
and
european
furniture
there
is
also
a
great
looking
-
glass
in
a
frame
shining
like
gold
what
could
a
girl
want
more
and
while
almayer
looked
upon
him
in
silent
dismay
abdulla
spoke
in
a
more
confidential
tone
waving
his
attendants
away
and
finished
his
speech
by
pointing
out
the
material
advantages
of
such
an
alliance
and
offering
to
settle
upon
almayer
three
thousand
dollars
as
a
sign
of
his
sincere
friendship
and
the
price
of
the
girl
poor
almayer
was
nearly
having
a
fit
burning
with
the
desire
of
taking
abdulla
by
the
throat
he
had
but
to
think
of
his
helpless
position
in
the
midst
of
lawless
men
to
comprehend
the
necessity
of
diplomatic
conciliation
he
mastered
his
impulses
and
spoke
politely
and
coldly
saying
the
girl
was
young
and
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
tuan
reshid
a
faithful
and
a
hadji
would
not
want
an
infidel
woman
in
his
harem
and
seeing
abdulla
smile
sceptically
at
that
last
objection
he
remained
silent
not
trusting
himself
to
speak
more
not
daring
to
refuse
point
-
blank
nor
yet
to
say
anything
compromising
abdulla
understood
the
meaning
of
that
silence
and
rose
to
take
leave
with
a
grave
salaam
he
wished
his
friend
almayer
a
thousand
years
and
moved
down
the
steps
helped
dutifully
by
reshid
the
torch
-
bearers
shook
their
torches
scattering
a
shower
of
sparks
into
the
river
and
the
cortege
moved
off
leaving
almayer
agitated
but
greatly
relieved
by
their
departure
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
watched
the
glimmer
of
the
lights
amongst
the
tree
trunks
till
they
disappeared
and
complete
silence
succeeded
the
tramp
of
feet
and
the
murmur
of
voices
he
did
not
move
till
the
curtain
rustled
and
nina
came
out
on
the
verandah
and
sat
in
the
rocking
-
chair
where
she
used
to
spend
many
hours
every
day
she
gave
a
slight
rocking
motion
to
her
seat
leaning
back
with
half
-
closed
eyes
her
long
hair
shading
her
face
from
the
smoky
light
of
the
lamp
on
the
table
almayer
looked
at
her
furtively
but
the
face
was
as
impassible
as
ever
she
turned
her
head
slightly
towards
her
father
and
speaking
to
his
great
surprise
in
english
asked
was
that
abdulla
here
yes
said
almayer
just
gone
and
what
did
he
want
father
he
wanted
to
buy
you
for
reshid
answered
almayer
brutally
his
anger
getting
the
better
of
him
and
looking
at
the
girl
as
if
in
expectation
of
some
outbreak
of
feeling
but
nina
remained
apparently
unmoved
gazing
dreamily
into
the
black
night
outside
be
careful
nina
said
almayer
after
a
short
silence
and
rising
from
his
chair
when
you
go
paddling
alone
into
the
creeks
in
your
canoe
that
reshid
is
a
violent
scoundrel
and
there
is
no
saying
what
he
may
do
do
you
hear
me
she
was
standing
now
ready
to
go
in
one
hand
grasping
the
curtain
in
the
doorway
she
turned
round
throwing
her
heavy
tresses
back
by
a
sudden
gesture
do
you
think
he
would
dare
she
asked
quickly
and
then
turned
again
to
go
in
adding
in
a
lower
tone
he
would
not
dare
arabs
are
all
cowards
almayer
looked
after
her
astonished
he
did
not
seek
the
repose
of
his
hammock
he
walked
the
floor
absently
sometimes
stopping
by
the
balustrade
to
think
the
lamp
went
out
the
first
streak
of
dawn
broke
over
the
forest
almayer
shivered
in
the
damp
air
i
give
it
up
he
muttered
to
himself
lying
down
wearily
damn
those
women
well
if
the
girl
did
not
look
as
if
she
wanted
to
be
kidnapped
and
he
felt
a
nameless
fear
creep
into
his
heart
making
him
shiver
again
that
year
towards
the
breaking
up
of
the
south
-
west
monsoon
disquieting
rumours
reached
sambir
captain
ford
coming
up
to
almayer
'
s
house
for
an
evening
'
s
chat
brought
late
numbers
of
the
straits
times
giving
the
news
of
acheen
war
and
of
the
unsuccessful
dutch
expedition
the
nakhodas
of
the
rare
trading
praus
ascending
the
river
paid
visits
to
lakamba
discussing
with
that
potentate
the
unsettled
state
of
affairs
and
wagged
their
heads
gravely
over
the
recital
of
orang
blanda
exaction
severity
and
general
tyranny
as
exemplified
in
the
total
stoppage
of
gunpowder
trade
and
the
rigorous
visiting
of
all
suspicious
craft
trading
in
the
straits
of
macassar
even
the
loyal
soul
of
lakamba
was
stirred
into
a
state
of
inward
discontent
by
the
withdrawal
of
his
license
for
powder
and
by
the
abrupt
confiscation
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
barrels
of
that
commodity
by
the
gunboat
princess
amelia
when
after
a
hazardous
voyage
it
had
almost
reached
the
mouth
of
the
river
the
unpleasant
news
was
given
him
by
reshid
who
after
the
unsuccessful
issue
of
his
matrimonial
projects
had
made
a
long
voyage
amongst
the
islands
for
trading
purposes
had
bought
the
powder
for
his
friend
and
was
overhauled
and
deprived
of
it
on
his
return
when
actually
congratulating
himself
on
his
acuteness
in
avoiding
detection
reshid
'
s
wrath
was
principally
directed
against
almayer
whom
he
suspected
of
having
notified
the
dutch
authorities
of
the
desultory
warfare
carried
on
by
the
arabs
and
the
rajah
with
the
up
-
river
dyak
tribes
to
reshid
'
s
great
surprise
the
rajah
received
his
complaints
very
coldly
and
showed
no
signs
of
vengeful
disposition
towards
the
white
man
in
truth
lakamba
knew
very
well
that
almayer
was
perfectly
innocent
of
any
meddling
in
state
affairs
and
besides
his
attitude
towards
that
much
persecuted
individual
was
wholly
changed
in
consequence
of
a
reconciliation
effected
between
him
and
his
old
enemy
by
almayer
'
s
newly
-
found
friend
dain
maroola
almayer
had
now
a
friend
shortly
after
reshid
'
s
departure
on
his
commercial
journey
nina
drifting
slowly
with
the
tide
in
the
canoe
on
her
return
home
after
one
of
her
solitary
excursions
heard
in
one
of
the
small
creeks
a
splashing
as
if
of
heavy
ropes
dropping
in
the
water
and
the
prolonged
song
of
malay
seamen
when
some
heavy
pulling
is
to
be
done
through
the
thick
fringe
of
bushes
hiding
the
mouth
of
the
creek
she
saw
the
tall
spars
of
some
european
-
rigged
sailing
vessel
overtopping
the
summits
of
the
nipa
palms
a
brig
was
being
hauled
out
of
the
small
creek
into
the
main
stream
the
sun
had
set
and
during
the
short
moments
of
twilight
nina
saw
the
brig
aided
by
the
evening
breeze
and
the
flowing
tide
head
towards
sambir
under
her
set
foresail
the
girl
turned
her
canoe
out
of
the
main
river
into
one
of
the
many
narrow
channels
amongst
the
wooded
islets
and
paddled
vigorously
over
the
black
and
sleepy
backwaters
towards
sambir
her
canoe
brushed
the
water
-
palms
skirted
the
short
spaces
of
muddy
bank
where
sedate
alligators
looked
at
her
with
lazy
unconcern
and
just
as
darkness
was
setting
in
shot
out
into
the
broad
junction
of
the
two
main
branches
of
the
river
where
the
brig
was
already
at
anchor
with
sails
furled
yards
squared
and
decks
seemingly
untenanted
by
any
human
being
nina
had
to
cross
the
river
and
pass
pretty
close
to
the
brig
in
order
to
reach
home
on
the
low
promontory
between
the
two
branches
of
the
pantai
up
both
branches
in
the
houses
built
on
the
banks
and
over
the
water
the
lights
twinkled
already
reflected
in
the
still
waters
below
the
hum
of
voices
the
occasional
cry
of
a
child
the
rapid
and
abruptly
interrupted
roll
of
a
wooden
drum
together
with
some
distant
hailing
in
the
darkness
by
the
returning
fishermen
reached
her
over
the
broad
expanse
of
the
river
she
hesitated
a
little
before
crossing
the
sight
of
such
an
unusual
object
as
an
european
-
rigged
vessel
causing
her
some
uneasiness
but
the
river
in
its
wide
expansion
was
dark
enough
to
render
a
small
canoe
invisible
she
urged
her
small
craft
with
swift
strokes
of
her
paddle
kneeling
in
the
bottom
and
bending
forward
to
catch
any
suspicious
sound
while
she
steered
towards
the
little
jetty
of
lingard
and
co
to
which
the
strong
light
of
the
paraffin
lamp
shining
on
the
whitewashed
verandah
of
almayer
'
s
bungalow
served
as
a
convenient
guide
the
jetty
itself
under
the
shadow
of
the
bank
overgrown
by
drooping
bushes
was
hidden
in
darkness
before
even
she
could
see
it
she
heard
the
hollow
bumping
of
a
large
boat
against
its
rotten
posts
and
heard
also
the
murmur
of
whispered
conversation
in
that
boat
whose
white
paint
and
great
dimensions
faintly
visible
on
nearer
approach
made
her
rightly
guess
that
it
belonged
to
the
brig
just
anchored
stopping
her
course
by
a
rapid
motion
of
her
paddle
with
another
swift
stroke
she
sent
it
whirling
away
from
the
wharf
and
steered
for
a
little
rivulet
which
gave
access
to
the
back
courtyard
of
the
house
she
landed
at
the
muddy
head
of
the
creek
and
made
her
way
towards
the
house
over
the
trodden
grass
of
the
courtyard
to
the
left
from
the
cooking
shed
shone
a
red
glare
through
the
banana
plantation
she
skirted
and
the
noise
of
feminine
laughter
reached
her
from
there
in
the
silent
evening
she
rightly
judged
her
mother
was
not
near
laughter
and
mrs
almayer
not
being
close
neighbours
she
must
be
in
the
house
thought
nina
as
she
ran
lightly
up
the
inclined
plane
of
shaky
planks
leading
to
the
back
door
of
the
narrow
passage
dividing
the
house
in
two
outside
the
doorway
in
the
black
shadow
stood
the
faithful
ali
who
is
there
asked
nina
a
great
malay
man
has
come
answered
ali
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
excitement
he
is
a
rich
man
there
are
six
men
with
lances
real
soldat

understand
and
his
dress
is
very
brave

but
the
old
mem
is
gone
tuan
will
be
angry
merciful
allah
what
jewels
that
man
has
got
nina
slipped
past
the
outstretched
hand
of
the
slave
into
the
dark
passage
where
in
the
crimson
glow
of
the
hanging
curtain
close
by
its
other
end
she
could
see
a
small
dark
form
crouching
near
the
wall
her
mother
was
feasting
her
eyes
and
ears
with
what
was
taking
place
on
the
front
verandah
and
nina
approached
to
take
her
share
in
the
rare
pleasure
of
some
novelty
she
was
met
by
her
mother
'
s
extended
arm
and
by
a
low
murmured
warning
not
to
make
a
noise
have
you
seen
them
mother
asked
nina
in
a
breathless
whisper
mrs
almayer
turned
her
face
towards
the
girl
and
her
sunken
eyes
shone
strangely
in
the
red
half
-
light
of
the
passage
i
saw
him
she
said
in
an
almost
inaudible
tone
pressing
her
daughter
'
s
hand
with
her
bony
fingers
a
great
rajah
has
come
to
sambir
a
son
of
heaven
muttered
the
old
woman
to
herself
go
away
girl
the
two
women
stood
close
to
the
curtain
nina
wishing
to
approach
the
rent
in
the
stuff
and
her
mother
defending
the
position
with
angry
obstinacy
on
the
other
side
there
was
a
lull
in
the
conversation
but
the
breathing
of
several
men
the
occasional
light
tinkling
of
some
ornaments
the
clink
of
metal
scabbards
or
of
brass
siri
-
vessels
passed
from
hand
to
hand
was
audible
during
the
short
pause
the
women
struggled
silently
when
there
was
a
shuffling
noise
and
the
shadow
of
almayer
'
s
burly
form
fell
on
the
curtain
the
women
ceased
struggling
and
remained
motionless
almayer
had
stood
up
to
answer
his
guest
turning
his
back
to
the
doorway
unaware
of
what
was
going
on
on
the
other
side
he
spoke
in
a
tone
of
regretful
irritation

come
to
the
wrong
house

maroola

went
on
bitterly

with
his
hand
towards
the
houses
of
sambir

the

is
nothing

for

answer
a
short
time
then
added
all
that
i
have
said
is
true
and
there
is
nothing
more
nina
held
back
by
her
mother
heard
a
soft
voice
reply
with
a
calm
evenness
of
intonation
peculiar
to
the
better
class
malays
who
would
doubt
a
white
tuan

interrupted
himself
suddenly
asking
surprised
what
'
s
that
noise
tuan
almayer
had
also
