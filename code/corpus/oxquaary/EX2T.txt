it
was
the
evening
of
pierston
'
s
arrival
at
sylvania
castle
a
dignified
manor
-
house
in
a
nook
by
the
cliffs
with
modern
castellations
and
battlements
and
he
had
walked
through
the
rooms
about
the
lawn
and
into
the
surrounding
plantation
of
elms
which
on
this
island
of
treeless
rock
lent
a
unique
character
to
the
enclosure
in
name
nature
and
accessories
the
property
within
the
girdling
wall
formed
a
complete
antithesis
to
everything
in
its
precincts
to
find
other
trees
between
pebble
-
bank
and
beal
it
was
necessary
to
recede
a
little
in
time
to
dig
down
to
a
loose
stratum
of
the
underlying
stone
-
beds
where
a
forest
of
conifers
lay
as
petrifactions
their
heads
all
in
one
direction
as
blown
down
by
a
gale
in
the
secondary
geologic
epoch
dusk
had
closed
in
and
he
now
proceeded
with
what
was
after
all
the
real
business
of
his
sojourn
the
two
servants
who
had
been
left
to
take
care
of
the
house
were
in
their
own
quarters
and
he
went
out
unobserved
crossing
a
hollow
overhung
by
the
budding
boughs
he
approached
an
empty
garden
-
house
of
elizabethan
design
which
stood
on
the
outer
wall
of
the
grounds
and
commanded
by
a
window
the
fronts
of
the
nearest
cottages
among
them
was
the
home
of
the
resuscitated
avice
he
had
chosen
this
moment
for
his
outlook
through
knowing
that
the
villagers
were
in
no
hurry
to
pull
down
their
blinds
at
nightfall
and
as
he
had
divined
the
inside
of
the
young
woman
'
s
living
-
room
was
visible
to
him
as
formerly
illuminated
by
the
rays
of
its
own
lamp
a
subdued
thumping
came
every
now
and
then
from
the
apartment
she
was
ironing
linen
on
a
flannel
table
-
cloth
a
row
of
such
apparel
hanging
on
a
clothes
-
horse
by
the
fire
her
face
had
been
pale
when
he
encountered
her
but
now
it
was
warm
and
pink
with
her
exertions
and
the
heat
of
the
stove
yet
it
was
in
perfect
and
passionless
repose
which
imparted
a
minerva
cast
to
the
profile
when
she
glanced
up
her
lineaments
seemed
to
have
all
the
soul
and
heart
that
had
characterized
her
mother
'
s
and
had
been
with
her
a
true
index
of
the
spirit
within
could
it
be
possible
that
in
this
case
the
manifestation
was
fictitious
he
had
met
with
many
such
examples
of
hereditary
persistence
without
the
qualities
signified
by
the
traits
he
unconsciously
hoped
that
it
was
at
least
not
entirely
so
here
the
room
was
less
furnished
than
when
he
had
last
beheld
it
the
'
bo
-
fet
or
double
corner
-
cupboard
where
the
china
was
formerly
kept
had
disappeared
its
place
being
taken
by
a
plain
board
the
tall
old
clock
with
its
ancient
oak
carcase
arched
brow
and
humorous
mouth
was
also
not
to
be
seen
a
cheap
white
-
dialled
specimen
doing
its
work
what
these
displacements
might
betoken
saddened
his
humanity
less
than
it
cheered
his
primitive
instinct
in
pointing
out
how
her
necessities
might
bring
them
together
having
fixed
his
residence
near
her
for
some
lengthy
time
he
felt
in
no
hurry
to
obtrude
his
presence
just
now
and
went
indoors
that
this
girl
'
s
frame
was
doomed
to
be
a
real
embodiment
of
that
olden
seductive
one
that
protean
dream
-
creature
who
had
never
seen
fit
to
irradiate
the
mother
'
s
image
till
it
became
a
mere
memory
after
dissolution
he
doubted
less
every
moment
there
was
an
uneasiness
in
recognizing
such
there
was
something
abnormal
in
his
present
proclivity
a
certain
sanity
had
after
all
accompanied
his
former
idealizing
passions
the
beloved
had
seldom
informed
a
personality
which
while
enrapturing
his
soul
simultaneously
shocked
his
intellect
a
change
perhaps
had
come
it
was
a
fine
morning
on
the
morrow
walking
in
the
grounds
towards
the
gate
he
saw
avice
entering
his
hired
castle
with
a
broad
oval
wicker
-
basket
covered
with
a
white
cloth
which
burden
she
bore
round
to
the
back
door
of
course
she
washed
for
his
own
household
he
had
not
thought
of
that
in
the
morning
sunlight
she
appeared
rather
as
a
sylph
than
as
a
washerwoman
and
he
could
not
but
think
that
the
slightness
of
her
figure
was
as
ill
adapted
to
this
occupation
as
her
mother
'
s
had
been
but
after
all
it
was
not
the
washerwoman
that
he
saw
now
in
front
of
her
on
the
surface
of
her
was
shining
out
that
more
real
more
inter
-
penetrating
being
whom
he
knew
so
well
the
occupation
of
the
subserving
minion
the
blemishes
of
the
temporary
creature
who
formed
the
background
were
of
the
same
account
in
the
presentation
of
the
indispensable
one
as
the
supporting
posts
and
framework
in
a
pyrotechnic
display
she
left
the
house
and
went
homeward
by
a
path
of
which
he
was
not
aware
having
probably
changed
her
course
because
she
had
seen
him
standing
there
it
meant
nothing
for
she
had
hardly
become
acquainted
with
him
yet
that
she
should
have
avoided
him
was
a
new
experience
he
had
no
opportunity
for
a
further
study
of
her
by
distant
observation
and
hit
upon
a
pretext
for
bringing
her
face
to
face
with
him
he
found
fault
with
his
linen
and
directed
that
the
laundress
should
be
sent
for
'
she
is
rather
young
poor
little
thing
said
the
housemaid
apologetically
but
since
her
mother
'
s
death
she
has
enough
to
do
to
keep
above
water
and
we
make
shift
with
her
but
i
will
tell
her
sir
'
i
will
see
her
myself
send
her
in
when
she
comes
said
pierston
one
morning
accordingly
when
he
was
answering
a
spiteful
criticism
of
a
late
work
of
his
he
was
told
that
she
waited
his
pleasure
in
the
hall
he
went
out
'
about
the
washing
said
the
sculptor
stiffly
i
am
a
very
particular
person
and
i
wish
no
preparation
of
lime
to
be
used
'
i
did
not
know
folks
used
it
replied
the
maiden
in
a
scared
and
reserved
tone
without
looking
at
him
'
that
'
s
all
right
and
then
the
mangling
smashes
the
buttons
'
i
have
not
got
a
mangle
sir
she
murmured
'
ah
that
'
s
satisfactory
and
i
object
to
so
much
borax
in
the
starch
'
i
do
not
put
any
avice
returned
in
the
same
close
way
never
heard
the
name
o
'
t
afore
'
o
i
see
all
this
time
pierston
was
thinking
of
the
girl
or
as
the
scientific
might
say
nature
was
working
her
plans
for
the
next
generation
under
the
cloak
of
a
dialogue
on
linen
he
could
not
read
her
individual
character
owing
to
the
confusing
effect
of
her
likeness
to
a
woman
whom
he
had
valued
too
late
he
could
not
help
seeing
in
her
all
that
he
knew
of
another
and
veiling
in
her
all
that
did
not
harmonize
with
his
sense
of
metempsychosis
the
girl
seemed
to
think
of
nothing
but
the
business
in
hand
she
had
answered
to
the
point
and
was
hardly
aware
of
his
sex
or
of
his
shape
'
i
knew
your
mother
avice
he
said
you
remember
my
telling
you
so
'
yes
'
well
i
have
taken
this
house
for
two
or
three
months
and
you
will
be
very
useful
to
me
you
still
live
just
outside
the
wall
'
yes
sir
said
the
self
-
contained
girl
demurely
and
dispassionately
she
turned
to
leave
this
pretty
creature
with
features
so
still
there
was
something
strange
in
seeing
move
off
thus
that
form
which
he
knew
passing
well
she
who
was
once
so
throbbingly
alive
to
his
presence
that
not
many
yards
from
this
spot
she
had
flung
her
arms
round
him
and
given
him
a
kiss
which
despised
in
its
freshness
had
revived
in
him
latterly
as
the
dearest
kiss
of
all
his
life
and
now
this
'
daps
'
of
her
mother
(
as
they
called
her
in
the
dialect
here
)
this
perfect
copy
why
did
she
turn
away
'
your
mother
was
a
refined
and
well
-
informed
woman
i
think
i
remember
'
she
was
sir
everybody
said
so
'
i
hope
you
resemble
her
she
archly
shook
her
head
and
drew
warily
away
'
o
one
thing
more
avice
i
have
not
brought
much
linen
so
you
must
come
to
the
house
every
day
'
very
good
sir
'
you
wo
not
forget
that
'
o
no
then
he
let
her
go
he
was
a
town
man
and
she
an
artless
islander
yet
he
had
opened
himself
out
like
a
sea
-
anemone
without
disturbing
the
epiderm
of
her
nature
it
was
monstrous
that
a
maiden
who
had
assumed
the
personality
of
her
of
his
tenderest
memory
should
be
so
impervious
perhaps
it
was
he
who
was
wanting
avice
might
be
passion
masking
as
indifference
because
he
was
so
many
years
older
in
outward
show
this
brought
him
to
the
root
of
it
in
his
heart
he
was
not
a
day
older
than
when
he
had
wooed
the
mother
at
the
daughter
'
s
present
age
his
record
moved
on
with
the
years
his
sentiments
stood
still
when
he
beheld
those
of
his
fellows
who
were
defined
as
buffers
and
fogeys
imperturbable
matter
-
of
-
fact
slightly
ridiculous
beings
past
masters
in
the
art
of
populating
homes
schools
and
colleges
and
present
adepts
in
the
science
of
giving
away
brides
how
he
envied
them
assuming
them
to
feel
as
they
appeared
to
feel
with
their
commerce
and
their
politics
their
glasses
and
their
pipes
they
had
got
past
the
distracting
currents
of
passionateness
and
were
in
the
calm
waters
of
middle
-
aged
philosophy
but
he
their
contemporary
was
tossed
like
a
cork
hither
and
thither
upon
the
crest
of
every
fancy
precisely
as
he
had
been
tossed
when
he
was
half
his
present
age
with
the
burden
now
of
double
pain
to
himself
in
his
growing
vision
of
all
as
vanity
avice
had
gone
and
he
saw
her
no
more
that
day
since
he
could
not
again
call
upon
her
she
was
as
inaccessible
as
if
she
had
entered
the
military
citadel
on
the
hill
-
top
beyond
them
in
the
evening
he
went
out
and
paced
down
the
lane
to
the
red
king
'
s
castle
overhanging
the
cliff
beside
whose
age
the
castle
he
occupied
was
but
a
thing
of
yesterday
below
the
castle
precipice
lay
enormous
blocks
which
had
fallen
from
it
and
several
of
them
were
carved
over
with
names
and
initials
he
knew
the
spot
and
the
old
trick
well
and
by
searching
in
the
faint
moon
-
rays
he
found
a
pair
of
names
which
as
a
boy
he
himself
had
cut
they
were
'
avice
'
and
'
jocelyn
'
avice
caro
'
s
and
his
own
the
letters
were
now
nearly
worn
away
by
the
weather
and
the
brine
but
close
by
in
quite
fresh
letters
stood
'
ann
avice
coupled
with
the
name
'
isaac
they
could
not
have
been
there
more
than
two
or
three
years
and
the
'
ann
avice
'
was
probably
avice
the
second
who
was
isaac
some
boy
admirer
of
her
child
-
time
doubtless
he
retraced
his
steps
and
passed
the
caros
'
house
towards
his
own
the
revivified
avice
animated
the
dwelling
and
the
light
within
the
room
fell
upon
the
window
she
was
just
inside
that
blind
whenever
she
unexpectedly
came
to
the
castle
he
started
and
lost
placidity
it
was
not
at
her
presence
as
such
but
at
the
new
condition
which
seemed
to
have
something
sinister
in
it
on
the
other
hand
the
most
abrupt
encounter
with
him
moved
her
to
no
emotion
as
it
had
moved
her
prototype
in
the
old
days
she
was
indifferent
to
almost
unconscious
of
his
propinquity
he
was
no
more
than
a
statue
to
her
she
was
a
growing
fire
to
him
a
sudden
sapphic
terror
of
love
would
ever
and
anon
come
upon
the
sculptor
when
his
matured
reflecting
powers
would
insist
upon
informing
him
of
the
fearful
lapse
from
reasonableness
that
lay
in
this
infatuation
it
threw
him
into
a
sweat
what
if
now
at
last
he
were
doomed
to
do
penance
for
his
past
emotional
wanderings
(
in
a
material
sense
)
by
being
chained
in
fatal
fidelity
to
an
object
that
his
intellect
despised
one
night
he
dreamt
that
he
saw
dimly
masking
behind
that
young
countenance
'
the
weaver
of
wiles
'
herself
with
all
her
subtle
face
laughing
aloud
however
the
well
-
beloved
was
alive
again
had
been
lost
and
was
found
he
was
amazed
at
the
change
of
front
in
himself
she
had
worn
the
guise
of
strange
women
she
had
been
a
woman
of
every
class
from
the
dignified
daughter
of
some
ecclesiastic
or
peer
to
a
nubian
almeh
with
her
handkerchief
undulating
to
the
beats
of
the
tom
-
tom
but
all
these
embodiments
had
been
endowed
with
a
certain
smartness
either
of
the
flesh
or
spirit
some
with
wit
a
few
with
talent
and
even
genius
but
the
new
impersonation
had
apparently
nothing
beyond
sex
and
prettiness
she
knew
not
how
to
sport
a
fan
or
handkerchief
hardly
how
to
pull
on
a
glove
but
her
limited
life
was
innocent
and
that
went
far
poor
little
avice
her
mother
'
s
image
there
it
all
lay
after
all
her
parentage
was
as
good
as
his
own
it
was
misfortune
that
had
sent
her
down
to
this
odd
as
it
seemed
to
him
her
limitations
were
largely
what
he
loved
her
for
her
rejuvenating
power
over
him
had
ineffable
charm
he
felt
as
he
had
felt
when
standing
beside
her
predecessor
but
alas
he
was
twenty
years
further
on
towards
the
shade
a
few
mornings
later
he
was
looking
through
an
upper
back
window
over
a
screened
part
of
the
garden
the
door
beneath
him
opened
and
a
figure
appeared
tripping
forth
she
went
round
out
of
sight
to
where
the
gardener
was
at
work
and
presently
returned
with
a
bunch
of
green
stuff
fluttering
in
each
hand
it
was
avice
her
dark
hair
now
braided
up
snugly
under
a
cap
she
sailed
on
with
a
rapt
and
unconscious
face
her
thoughts
a
thousand
removes
from
him
how
she
had
suddenly
come
to
be
an
inmate
of
his
own
house
he
could
not
understand
till
he
recalled
the
fact
that
he
had
given
the
castle
servants
a
whole
holiday
to
attend
a
review
of
the
yeomanry
in
the
watering
-
place
over
the
bay
on
their
stating
that
they
could
provide
a
temporary
substitute
to
stay
in
the
house
they
had
evidently
called
in
avice
to
his
great
pleasure
he
discovered
their
opinion
of
his
requirements
to
be
such
a
mean
one
that
they
had
called
in
no
one
else
the
spirit
as
she
seemed
to
him
brought
his
lunch
into
the
room
where
he
was
writing
and
he
beheld
her
uncover
it
she
went
to
the
window
to
adjust
a
blind
which
had
slipped
and
he
had
a
good
view
of
her
profile
it
was
not
unlike
that
of
one
of
the
three
goddesses
in
rubens
'
s
'
judgment
of
paris
and
in
contour
was
nigh
perfection
but
it
was
in
her
full
face
that
the
vision
of
her
mother
was
most
apparent
'
did
you
cook
all
this
avice
he
asked
arousing
himself
she
turned
and
half
-
smiled
merely
murmuring
yes
sir
well
he
knew
the
arrangement
of
those
white
teeth
in
the
junction
of
two
of
the
upper
ones
there
was
a
slight
irregularity
no
stranger
would
have
noticed
it
nor
would
he
but
that
he
knew
of
the
same
mark
in
her
mother
'
s
mouth
and
looked
for
it
here
till
avice
the
second
had
revealed
it
this
moment
by
her
smile
he
had
never
beheld
that
mark
since
the
parting
from
avice
the
first
when
she
had
smiled
under
his
kiss
as
the
copy
had
done
now
next
morning
when
dressing
he
heard
her
through
the
ricketty
floor
of
the
building
engaged
in
conversation
with
the
other
servants
having
by
this
time
regularly
installed
herself
as
the
exponent
of
the
long
-
pursued
as
one
who
by
no
initiative
of
his
own
had
been
chosen
by
some
superior
power
as
the
vehicle
of
her
next
debut
she
attracted
him
by
the
cadences
of
her
voice
she
would
suddenly
drop
it
to
a
rich
whisper
of
roguishness
when
the
slight
rural
monotony
of
its
narrative
speech
disappeared
and
soul
and
heart
or
what
seemed
soul
and
heart
resounded
the
charm
lay
in
the
intervals
using
that
word
in
its
musical
sense
she
would
say
a
few
syllables
in
one
note
and
end
her
sentence
in
a
soft
modulation
upwards
then
downwards
then
into
her
own
note
again
the
curve
of
sound
was
as
artistic
as
any
line
of
beauty
ever
struck
by
his
pencil
as
satisfying
as
the
curves
of
her
who
was
the
world
'
s
desire
the
subject
of
her
discourse
he
cared
nothing
about
it
was
no
more
his
interest
than
his
concern
he
took
special
pains
that
in
catching
her
voice
he
might
not
comprehend
her
words
to
the
tones
he
had
a
right
none
to
the
articulations
by
degrees
he
could
not
exist
long
without
this
sound
on
sunday
evening
he
found
that
she
went
to
church
he
followed
behind
her
over
the
open
road
keeping
his
eye
on
the
little
hat
with
its
bunch
of
cock
'
s
feathers
as
on
a
star
when
she
had
passed
in
pierston
observed
her
position
and
took
a
seat
behind
her
engaged
in
the
study
of
her
ear
and
the
nape
of
her
white
neck
he
suddenly
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
lady
still
further
ahead
in
the
aisle
whose
attire
though
of
black
materials
in
the
quietest
form
was
of
a
cut
which
rather
suggested
london
than
this
ultima
thule
for
the
minute
he
forgot
in
his
curiosity
that
avice
intervened
the
lady
turned
her
head
somewhat
and
though
she
was
veiled
with
unusual
thickness
for
the
season
he
seemed
to
recognize
nichola
pine
-
avon
in
the
form
why
should
mrs
pine
-
avon
be
there
pierston
asked
himself
if
it
should
indeed
be
she
the
end
of
the
service
saw
his
attention
again
concentrated
on
avice
to
such
a
degree
that
at
the
critical
moment
of
moving
out
he
forgot
the
mysterious
lady
in
front
of
her
and
found
that
she
had
left
the
church
by
the
side
-
door
supposing
it
to
have
been
mrs
pine
-
avon
she
would
probably
be
discovered
staying
at
one
of
the
hotels
at
the
watering
-
place
over
the
bay
and
to
have
come
along
the
pebble
-
bank
to
the
island
as
so
many
did
for
an
evening
drive
for
the
present
however
the
explanation
was
not
forthcoming
and
he
did
not
seek
it
when
he
emerged
from
the
church
the
great
placid
eye
of
the
lighthouse
at
the
beal
point
was
open
and
he
moved
thitherward
a
few
steps
to
escape
nichola
or
her
double
and
the
rest
of
the
congregation
turning
at
length
he
hastened
homeward
along
the
now
deserted
trackway
intending
to
overtake
the
revitalized
avice
but
he
could
see
nothing
of
her
and
concluded
that
she
had
walked
too
fast
for
him
arrived
at
his
own
gate
he
paused
a
moment
and
perceived
that
avice
'
s
little
freehold
was
still
in
darkness
she
had
not
come
he
retraced
his
steps
but
could
not
find
her
the
only
persons
on
the
road
being
a
man
and
his
wife
as
he
knew
them
to
be
though
he
could
not
see
them
from
the
words
of
the
man
'
if
you
had
not
a
'
ready
married
me
you
'
d
cut
my
acquaintance
that
'
s
a
pretty
thing
for
a
wife
to
say
the
remark
struck
his
ear
unpleasantly
and
by
-
and
-
by
he
went
back
again
avice
'
s
cottage
was
now
lighted
she
must
have
come
round
by
the
other
road
satisfied
that
she
was
safely
domiciled
for
the
night
he
opened
the
gate
of
sylvania
castle
and
retired
to
his
room
also
eastward
from
the
grounds
the
cliffs
were
rugged
and
the
view
of
the
opposite
coast
picturesque
in
the
extreme
a
little
door
from
the
lawn
gave
him
immediate
access
to
the
rocks
and
shore
on
this
side
without
the
door
was
a
dip
-
well
of
pure
water
which
possibly
had
supplied
the
inmates
of
the
adjoining
and
now
ruinous
red
king
'
s
castle
at
the
time
of
its
erection
on
a
sunny
morning
he
was
meditating
here
when
he
discerned
a
figure
on
the
shore
below
spreading
white
linen
upon
the
pebbly
strand
jocelyn
descended
avice
as
he
had
supposed
had
now
returned
to
her
own
occupation
her
shapely
pink
arms
though
slight
were
plump
enough
to
show
dimples
at
the
elbows
and
were
set
off
by
her
purple
cotton
print
which
the
shore
-
breeze
licked
and
tantalized
he
stood
near
without
speaking
the
wind
dragged
a
shirt
-
sleeve
from
the
'
popple
'
or
pebble
which
held
it
down
pierston
stooped
and
put
a
heavier
one
in
its
place
'
thank
you
she
said
quietly
she
turned
up
her
hazel
eyes
and
seemed
gratified
to
perceive
that
her
assistant
was
pierston
she
had
plainly
been
so
wrapped
in
her
own
thoughts
gloomy
thoughts
by
their
signs
that
she
had
not
considered
him
till
then
the
young
girl
continued
to
converse
with
him
in
friendly
frankness
showing
neither
ardour
nor
shyness
as
for
love
it
was
evidently
further
from
her
mind
than
even
death
and
dissolution
when
one
of
the
sheets
became
intractable
jocelyn
said
do
you
hold
it
down
and
i
will
put
the
popples
she
acquiesced
and
in
placing
a
pebble
his
hand
touched
hers
it
was
a
young
hand
rather
long
and
thin
a
little
damp
and
coddled
from
her
slopping
in
setting
down
the
last
stone
he
laid
it
by
a
pure
accident
rather
heavily
on
her
fingers
'
i
am
very
very
sorry
jocelyn
exclaimed
o
i
have
bruised
the
skin
avice
he
seized
her
fingers
to
examine
the
damage
done
'
no
sir
you
have
not
she
cried
luminously
allowing
him
to
retain
her
hand
without
the
least
objection
why
that
'
s
where
i
scratched
it
this
morning
with
a
pin
you
did
not
hurt
me
a
bit
with
the
popple
-
stone
although
her
gown
was
purple
there
was
a
little
black
crape
bow
upon
each
arm
he
knew
what
it
meant
and
it
saddened
him
do
you
ever
visit
your
mother
'
s
grave
he
asked
'
yes
sir
sometimes
i
am
going
there
tonight
to
water
the
daisies
she
had
now
finished
here
and
they
parted
that
evening
when
the
sky
was
red
he
emerged
by
the
garden
-
door
and
passed
her
house
the
blinds
were
not
down
and
he
could
see
her
sewing
within
while
he
paused
she
sprang
up
as
if
she
had
forgotten
the
hour
and
tossed
on
her
hat
jocelyn
strode
ahead
and
round
the
corner
and
was
halfway
up
the
straggling
street
before
he
discerned
her
little
figure
behind
him
he
hastened
past
the
lads
and
young
women
with
clinking
buckets
who
were
drawing
water
from
the
fountains
by
the
wayside
and
took
the
direction
of
the
church
with
the
disappearance
of
the
sun
the
lighthouse
had
again
set
up
its
flame
against
the
sky
the
dark
church
rising
in
the
foreground
here
he
allowed
her
to
overtake
him
'
you
loved
your
mother
much
said
jocelyn
'
i
did
sir
of
course
i
did
said
the
girl
who
tripped
so
lightly
that
it
seemed
he
might
have
carried
her
on
his
hand
pierston
wished
to
say
so
did
i
but
did
not
like
to
disclose
events
which
she
apparently
never
guessed
avice
fell
into
thought
and
continued
'
mother
had
a
very
sad
life
for
some
time
when
she
was
about
as
old
as
i
i
should
not
like
mine
to
be
as
hers
her
young
man
proved
false
to
her
because
she
would
not
agree
to
meet
him
one
night
and
it
grieved
mother
almost
all
her
life
i
would
not
ha
'
fretted
about
him
if
i
'
d
been
she
she
would
never
name
his
name
but
i
know
he
was
a
wicked
cruel
man
and
i
hate
to
think
of
him
after
this
he
could
not
go
into
the
churchyard
with
her
and
walked
onward
alone
to
the
south
of
the
isle
he
was
wretched
for
hours
yet
he
would
not
have
stood
where
he
did
stand
in
the
ranks
of
an
imaginative
profession
if
he
had
not
been
at
the
mercy
of
every
haunting
of
the
fancy
that
can
beset
man
it
was
in
his
weaknesses
as
a
citizen
and
a
national
-
unit
that
his
strength
lay
as
an
artist
and
he
felt
it
childish
to
complain
of
susceptibilities
not
only
innate
but
cultivated
but
he
was
paying
dearly
enough
for
his
liliths
he
saw
a
terrible
vengeance
ahead
what
had
he
done
to
be
tormented
like
this
the
beloved
after
flitting
from
nichola
pine
-
avon
to
the
phantom
of
a
dead
woman
whom
he
never
adored
in
her
lifetime
had
taken
up
her
abode
in
the
living
representative
of
the
dead
with
a
permanence
of
hold
which
the
absolute
indifference
of
that
little
brown
-
eyed
representative
only
seemed
to
intensify
did
he
really
wish
to
proceed
to
marriage
with
this
chit
of
a
girl
he
did
the
wish
had
come
at
last
it
was
true
that
as
he
studied
her
he
saw
defects
in
addition
to
her
social
insufficiencies
judgment
hoodwinked
as
it
was
told
him
that
she
was
colder
in
nature
commoner
in
character
than
that
well
read
bright
little
woman
avice
the
first
but
twenty
years
make
a
difference
in
ideals
and
the
added
demands
of
middle
-
age
in
physical
form
are
more
than
balanced
by
its
concessions
as
to
the
spiritual
content
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
and
felt
glad
at
those
inner
deficiencies
in
avice
which
formerly
would
have
impelled
him
to
reject
her
there
was
a
strange
difference
in
his
regard
of
his
present
folly
and
of
his
love
in
his
youthful
time
now
he
could
be
mad
with
method
knowing
it
to
be
madness
then
he
was
compelled
to
make
believe
his
madness
wisdom
in
those
days
any
flash
of
reason
upon
his
loved
one
'
s
imperfections
was
blurred
over
hastily
and
with
fear
such
penetrative
vision
now
did
not
cool
him
he
knew
he
was
the
creature
of
a
tendency
and
passively
acquiesced
to
use
a
practical
eye
it
appeared
that
as
he
had
once
thought
this
caro
family
though
it
might
not
for
centuries
or
ever
furbish
up
an
individual
nature
which
would
exactly
ideally
supplement
his
own
imperfect
one
and
round
with
it
the
perfect
whole
was
yet
the
only
family
he
had
ever
met
or
was
likely
to
meet
which
possessed
the
materials
for
her
making
it
was
as
if
the
caros
had
found
the
clay
but
not
the
potter
while
other
families
whose
daughters
might
attract
him
had
found
the
potter
but
not
the
clay
from
his
roomy
castle
and
its
grounds
and
the
cliffs
hard
by
he
could
command
every
move
and
aspect
of
her
who
was
the
rejuvenated
spirit
of
the
past
to
him
in
the
effulgence
of
whom
all
sordid
details
were
disregarded
among
other
things
he
observed
that
she
was
often
anxious
when
it
rained
if
after
a
wet
day
a
golden
streak
appeared
in
the
sky
over
deadman
'
s
bay
under
a
lid
of
cloud
her
manner
was
joyous
and
her
tread
light
this
puzzled
him
and
he
found
that
if
he
endeavoured
to
encounter
her
at
these
times
she
shunned
him
stealthily
and
subtly
but
unmistakably
one
evening
when
she
had
left
her
cottage
and
tripped
off
in
the
direction
of
the
under
-
hill
townlet
he
set
out
by
the
same
route
resolved
to
await
her
return
along
the
high
roadway
which
stretched
between
that
place
and
east
quarriers
he
reached
the
top
of
the
old
road
where
it
makes
a
sudden
descent
to
the
townlet
but
she
did
not
appear
turning
back
he
sauntered
along
till
he
had
nearly
reached
his
own
house
again
then
he
retraced
his
steps
and
in
the
dim
night
he
walked
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
bare
and
lofty
convex
of
the
isle
the
stars
above
and
around
him
the
lighthouse
on
duty
at
the
distant
point
the
lightship
winking
from
the
sandbank
the
combing
of
the
pebble
beach
by
the
tide
beneath
the
church
away
south
-
westward
where
the
island
fathers
lay
he
walked
the
wild
summit
till
his
legs
ached
and
his
heart
ached
till
he
seemed
to
hear
on
the
upper
wind
the
stones
of
the
slingers
whizzing
past
and
the
voices
of
the
invaders
who
annihilated
them
and
married
their
wives
and
daughters
and
produced
avice
as
the
ultimate
flower
of
the
combined
stocks
still
she
did
not
come
it
was
more
than
foolish
to
wait
yet
he
could
not
help
waiting
at
length
he
discerned
a
dot
of
a
figure
which
he
knew
to
be
hers
rather
by
its
motion
than
by
its
shape
how
incomparably
the
immaterial
dream
dwarfed
the
grandest
of
substantial
things
when
here
between
those
three
sublimities
the
sky
the
rock
and
the
ocean
the
minute
personality
of
this
washer
-
girl
filled
his
consciousness
to
its
extremest
boundary
and
the
stupendous
inanimate
scene
shrank
to
a
corner
therein
but
all
at
once
the
approaching
figure
had
disappeared
he
looked
about
she
had
certainly
vanished
at
one
side
of
the
road
was
a
low
wall
but
she
could
not
have
gone
behind
that
without
considerable
trouble
and
singular
conduct
he
looked
behind
him
she
had
reappeared
further
on
the
road
jocelyn
pierston
hurried
after
and
discerning
his
movement
avice
stood
still
when
he
came
up
she
was
slily
shaking
with
restrained
laughter
'
well
what
does
this
mean
my
dear
girl
he
asked
her
inner
mirth
escaping
in
spite
of
her
she
turned
askance
and
said
when
you
was
following
me
to
street
o
'
wells
two
hours
ago
i
looked
round
and
saw
you
and
huddied
behind
a
stone
you
passed
and
brushed
my
frock
without
seeing
me
and
when
on
my
way
backalong
i
saw
you
waiting
hereabout
again
i
slipped
over
the
wall
and
ran
past
you
if
i
had
not
stopped
and
looked
round
at
'
ee
you
would
never
have
catched
me
'
what
did
you
do
that
for
you
elf
'
that
you
should
not
find
me
'
that
'
s
not
exactly
a
reason
give
another
dear
avice
he
said
as
he
turned
and
walked
beside
her
homeward
she
hesitated
come
he
urged
again
'
'
twas
because
i
thought
you
wanted
to
be
my
young
man
she
answered
'
what
a
wild
thought
of
yours
supposing
i
did
would
not
you
have
me
'
not
now
and
not
for
long
even
if
it
had
been
sooner
than
now
'
why
'
if
i
tell
you
you
wo
not
laugh
at
me
or
let
anybody
else
know
'
never
'
then
i
will
tell
you
she
said
quite
seriously
tis
because
i
get
tired
o
'
my
lovers
as
soon
as
i
get
to
know
them
well
what
i
see
in
one
young
man
for
a
while
soon
leaves
him
and
goes
into
another
yonder
and
i
follow
and
then
what
i
admire
fades
out
of
him
and
springs
up
somewhere
else
and
so
i
follow
on
and
never
fix
to
one
i
have
loved
fifteen
a
'
ready
yes
fifteen
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
say
she
repeated
laughing
i
ca
not
help
it
sir
i
assure
you
of
course
it
is
really
to
me
the
same
one
all
through
on
'
y
i
ca
not
catch
him
she
added
anxiously
you
wo
not
tell
anybody
o
'
this
in
me
will
you
sir
because
if
it
were
known
i
am
afraid
no
man
would
like
me
pierston
was
surprised
into
stillness
here
was
this
obscure
and
almost
illiterate
girl
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
the
impossible
ideal
just
as
he
had
been
himself
doing
for
the
last
twenty
years
she
was
doing
it
quite
involuntarily
by
sheer
necessity
of
her
organization
puzzled
all
the
while
at
her
own
instinct
he
suddenly
thought
of
its
bearing
upon
himself
and
said
with
a
sinking
heart
'
am
i
one
of
them
she
pondered
critically
'
you
was
for
a
week
when
i
first
saw
you
'
only
a
week
'
about
that
'
what
made
the
being
of
your
fancy
forsake
my
form
and
go
elsewhere
'
well
though
you
seemed
handsome
and
gentlemanly
at
first
'
yes
'
i
found
you
too
old
soon
after
'
you
are
a
candid
young
person
'
but
you
asked
me
sir
she
expostulated
'
i
did
and
having
been
answered
i
wo
not
intrude
upon
you
longer
so
cut
along
home
as
fast
as
you
can
it
is
getting
late
when
she
had
passed
out
of
earshot
he
also
followed
homewards
this
seeking
of
the
well
-
beloved
was
then
of
the
nature
of
a
knife
which
could
cut
two
ways
to
be
the
seeker
was
one
thing
to
be
one
of
the
corpses
from
which
the
ideal
inhabitant
had
departed
was
another
and
this
was
what
he
had
become
now
in
the
mockery
of
new
days
the
startling
parallel
in
the
idiosyncracies
of
avice
and
himself
evinced
by
the
elusiveness
of
the
beloved
with
her
as
with
him
meant
probably
that
there
had
been
some
remote
ancestor
common
to
both
families
from
whom
the
trait
had
latently
descended
and
recrudesced
but
the
result
was
none
the
less
disconcerting
drawing
near
his
own
gate
he
smelt
tobacco
and
could
discern
two
figures
in
the
side
lane
leading
past
avice
'
s
door
they
did
not
however
enter
her
house
but
strolled
onward
to
the
narrow
pass
conducting
to
red
-
king
castle
and
the
sea
he
was
in
momentary
heaviness
at
the
thought
that
they
might
be
avice
with
a
worthless
lover
but
a
faintly
argumentative
tone
from
the
man
informed
him
that
they
were
the
same
married
couple
going
homeward
whom
he
had
encountered
on
a
previous
occasion
the
next
day
he
gave
the
servants
a
half
-
holiday
to
get
the
pretty
avice
into
the
castle
again
for
a
few
hours
the
better
to
observe
her
while
she
was
pulling
down
the
blinds
at
sunset
a
whistle
of
peculiar
quality
came
from
some
point
on
the
cliffs
outside
the
lawn
he
observed
that
her
colour
rose
slightly
though
she
bustled
about
as
if
she
had
noticed
nothing
pierston
suddenly
suspected
that
she
had
not
only
fifteen
past
admirers
but
a
current
one
still
he
might
be
mistaken
stimulated
now
by
ancient
memories
and
present
tenderness
to
use
every
effort
to
make
her
his
wife
despite
her
conventional
unfitness
he
strung
himself
up
to
sift
this
mystery
if
he
could
only
win
her
and
how
could
a
country
girl
refuse
such
an
opportunity
he
could
pack
her
off
to
school
for
two
or
three
years
marry
her
enlarge
her
mind
by
a
little
travel
and
take
his
chance
of
the
rest
as
to
her
want
of
ardour
for
him
so
sadly
in
contrast
with
her
sainted
mother
'
s
affection
a
man
twenty
years
older
than
his
bride
could
expect
no
better
and
he
would
be
well
content
to
put
up
with
it
in
the
pleasure
of
possessing
one
in
whom
seemed
to
linger
as
an
aroma
all
the
charm
of
his
youth
and
his
early
home
it
was
a
sad
and
leaden
afternoon
and
pierston
paced
up
the
long
steep
pass
or
street
of
the
wells
on
either
side
of
the
road
young
girls
stood
with
pitchers
at
the
fountains
which
bubbled
there
and
behind
the
houses
forming
the
propylaea
of
the
rock
rose
the
massive
forehead
of
the
isle
crested
at
this
part
with
its
enormous
ramparts
as
with
a
mural
crown
as
you
approach
the
upper
end
of
the
street
all
progress
seems
about
to
be
checked
by
the
almost
vertical
face
of
the
escarpment
into
it
your
track
apparently
runs
point
-
blank
a
confronting
mass
which
if
it
were
to
slip
down
would
overwhelm
the
whole
town
but
in
a
moment
you
find
that
the
road
the
old
roman
highway
into
the
peninsula
turns
at
a
sharp
angle
when
it
reaches
the
base
of
the
scarp
and
ascends
in
the
stiffest
of
inclines
to
the
right
to
the
left
there
is
also
another
ascending
road
modern
almost
as
steep
as
the
first
and
perfectly
straight
this
is
the
road
to
the
forts
pierston
arrived
at
the
forking
of
the
ways
and
paused
for
breath
before
turning
to
the
right
his
proper
and
picturesque
course
he
looked
up
the
uninteresting
left
road
to
the
fortifications
it
was
new
long
white
regular
tapering
to
a
vanishing
point
like
a
lesson
in
perspective
about
a
quarter
of
the
way
up
a
girl
was
resting
beside
a
basket
of
white
linen
and
by
the
shape
of
her
hat
and
the
nature
of
her
burden
he
recognized
her
she
did
not
see
him
and
abandoning
the
right
-
hand
course
he
slowly
ascended
the
incline
she
had
taken
he
observed
that
her
attention
was
absorbed
by
something
aloft
he
followed
the
direction
of
her
gaze
above
them
towered
the
green
-
grey
mountain
of
grassy
stone
here
levelled
at
the
top
by
military
art
the
skyline
was
broken
every
now
and
then
by
a
little
peg
-
like
object
a
sentry
-
box
and
near
one
of
these
a
small
red
spot
kept
creeping
backwards
and
forwards
monotonously
against
the
heavy
sky
then
he
divined
that
she
had
a
soldier
-
lover
she
turned
her
head
saw
him
and
took
up
her
clothes
-
basket
to
continue
the
ascent
the
steepness
was
such
that
to
climb
it
unencumbered
was
a
breathless
business
the
linen
made
her
task
a
cruelty
to
her
you
will
never
get
to
the
forts
with
that
weight
he
said
give
it
to
me
but
she
would
not
and
he
stood
still
watching
her
as
she
panted
up
the
way
for
the
moment
an
irradiated
being
the
epitome
of
a
whole
sex
by
the
beams
of
his
own
infatuation
robed
in
such
exceeding
glory
that
he
beheld
her
not
beheld
her
not
as
she
really
was
as
she
was
even
to
himself
sometimes
but
to
the
soldier
what
was
she
smaller
and
smaller
she
waned
up
the
rigid
mathematical
road
still
gazing
at
the
soldier
aloft
as
pierston
gazed
at
her
he
could
just
discern
sentinels
springing
up
at
the
different
coigns
of
vantage
that
she
passed
but
seeing
who
she
was
they
did
not
intercept
her
and
presently
she
crossed
the
drawbridge
over
the
enormous
chasm
surrounding
the
forts
passed
the
sentries
there
also
and
disappeared
through
the
arch
into
the
interior
pierston
could
not
see
the
sentry
now
and
there
occurred
to
him
the
hateful
idea
that
this
scarlet
rival
was
meeting
and
talking
freely
to
her
the
unprotected
orphan
girl
of
his
sweet
original
avice
perhaps
relieved
of
duty
escorting
her
across
the
interior
carrying
her
basket
her
tender
body
encircled
by
his
arm
'
what
the
devil
are
you
staring
at
as
if
you
were
in
a
trance
pierston
turned
his
head
and
there
stood
his
old
friend
somers
still
looking
the
long
-
leased
bachelor
that
he
was
'
i
might
say
what
the
devil
do
you
do
here
if
i
were
not
so
glad
to
see
you
somers
said
that
he
had
come
to
see
what
was
detaining
his
friend
in
such
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
place
at
that
time
of
year
and
incidentally
to
get
some
fresh
air
into
his
own
lungs
pierston
made
him
welcome
and
they
went
towards
sylvania
castle
'
you
were
staring
as
far
as
i
could
see
at
a
pretty
little
washerwoman
with
a
basket
of
clothes
resumed
the
painter
'
yes
it
was
that
to
you
but
not
to
me
behind
the
mere
pretty
island
-
girl
(
to
the
world
)
is
in
my
eye
the
idea
in
platonic
phraseology
the
essence
and
epitome
of
all
that
is
desirable
in
this
existence
i
am
under
a
doom
somers
yes
i
am
under
a
doom
to
have
been
always
following
a
phantom
whom
i
saw
in
woman
after
woman
while
she
was
at
a
distance
but
vanishing
away
on
close
approach
was
bad
enough
but
now
the
terrible
thing
is
that
the
phantom
does
not
vanish
but
stays
to
tantalize
me
even
when
i
am
near
enough
to
see
what
it
is
that
girl
holds
me
though
my
eyes
are
open
and
though
i
see
that
i
am
a
fool
somers
regarded
the
visionary
look
of
his
friend
which
rather
intensified
than
decreased
as
his
years
wore
on
but
made
no
further
remark
when
they
reached
the
castle
somers
gazed
round
upon
the
scenery
and
pierston
signifying
the
quaint
little
elizabethan
cottage
said
that
'
s
where
she
lives
'
what
a
romantic
place
and
this
island
altogether
a
man
might
love
a
scarecrow
or
turnip
-
lantern
here
'
but
a
woman
might
not
scenery
does
not
impress
them
though
they
pretend
it
does
this
girl
is
as
fickle
as
'
you
once
were
'
exactly
from
your
point
of
view
she
has
told
me
so
candidly
and
it
hits
me
hard
somers
stood
still
in
sudden
thought
well
that
is
a
strange
turning
of
the
tables
he
said
but
you
would
not
really
marry
her
pierston
'
i
would
to
-
morrow
why
should
not
i
what
are
fame
and
name
and
society
to
me
a
descendant
of
wreckers
and
smugglers
like
her
besides
i
know
what
she
is
made
of
my
boy
to
her
innermost
fibre
i
know
the
perfect
and
pure
quarry
she
was
dug
from
and
that
gives
a
man
confidence
'
then
you
will
win
while
they
were
sitting
after
dinner
that
evening
their
quiet
discourse
was
interrupted
by
the
long
low
whistle
from
the
cliffs
without
somers
took
no
notice
but
pierston
marked
it
that
whistle
always
occurred
at
the
same
time
in
the
evening
when
avice
was
helping
in
the
house
he
excused
himself
for
a
moment
to
his
visitor
and
went
out
upon
the
dark
lawn
a
crunching
of
feet
upon
the
gravel
mixed
in
with
the
articulation
of
the
sea
steps
light
as
if
they
were
winged
and
he
supposed
two
minutes
later
that
the
mouth
of
some
hulking
fellow
was
upon
hers
which
he
himself
hardly
ventured
to
look
at
so
touching
was
its
young
beauty
hearing
people
about
among
others
the
before
-
mentioned
married
couple
quarrelling
the
woman
'
s
tones
having
a
kinship
to
avice
'
s
own
he
returned
to
the
house
next
day
somers
roamed
abroad
to
look
for
scenery
for
a
marine
painting
and
going
out
to
seek
him
pierston
met
avice
'
so
you
have
a
lover
my
lady
he
said
severely
she
admitted
that
it
was
the
fact
you
wo
not
stick
to
him
he
continued
'
i
think
i
may
to
this
one
said
she
in
a
meaning
tone
that
he
failed
to
fathom
then
he
deserted
me
once
but
he
wo
not
again
'
i
suppose
he
is
a
wonderful
sort
of
fellow
'
he
is
good
enough
for
me
'
so
handsome
no
doubt
'
handsome
enough
for
me
'
so
refined
and
respectable
'
refined
and
respectable
enough
for
me
he
could
not
disturb
her
equanimity
and
let
her
pass
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
somers
having
chosen
his
view
at
the
other
end
of
the
island
pierston
determined
in
the
afternoon
to
see
avice
'
s
lover
he
found
that
she
had
left
her
cottage
stronghold
and
went
on
towards
the
lighthouses
at
the
beal
turning
back
when
he
had
reached
the
nearest
he
saw
on
the
lonely
road
between
the
quarries
a
young
man
evidently
connected
with
the
stone
trade
with
avice
the
second
upon
his
arm
she
looked
prettily
guilty
and
blushed
a
little
under
his
glance
the
man
'
s
was
one
of
the
typical
island
physiognomies
his
features
energetic
and
wary
in
their
expression
and
half
covered
with
a
close
crisp
black
beard
pierston
fancied
that
out
of
his
keen
dark
eyes
there
glimmered
a
dry
sense
of
humour
at
the
situation
if
so
avice
must
have
told
him
of
pierston
'
s
symptoms
of
tenderness
this
girl
whom
for
her
dear
mother
'
s
sake
more
than
for
her
own
unquestionable
attractiveness
he
would
have
guarded
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
how
could
she
estimate
him
so
flippantly
the
mortification
of
having
brought
himself
to
this
position
with
the
antitype
by
his
early
slight
of
the
type
blinded
him
for
the
moment
to
what
struck
him
a
short
time
after
the
man
upon
whose
arm
she
hung
was
not
a
soldier
what
then
became
of
her
entranced
gaze
at
the
sentinel
she
could
hardly
have
transferred
her
affections
so
promptly
or
to
give
her
the
benefit
of
his
own
theory
her
beloved
could
scarcely
have
flitted
from
frame
to
frame
in
so
very
brief
an
interval
and
which
of
them
had
been
he
who
whistled
softly
in
the
dusk
to
her
without
further
attempt
to
find
alfred
somers
pierston
walked
homeward
moodily
thinking
that
the
desire
to
make
reparation
to
the
original
woman
by
wedding
and
enriching
the
copy
which
lent
such
an
unprecedented
permanence
to
his
new
love
was
thwarted
as
if
by
set
intention
of
his
destiny
at
the
door
of
the
grounds
about
the
castle
there
stood
a
carriage
he
observed
that
it
was
not
one
of
the
homely
flys
from
the
under
-
hill
town
but
apparently
from
the
popular
resort
across
the
bay
wondering
why
the
visitor
had
not
driven
in
he
entered
to
find
in
the
drawing
-
room
nichola
pine
-
avon
at
his
first
glance
upon
her
fashionably
dressed
and
graceful
in
movement
she
seemed
beautiful
at
the
second
when
he
observed
that
her
face
was
pale
and
agitated
she
seemed
pathetic
likewise
altogether
she
was
now
a
very
different
figure
from
her
who
sitting
in
her
chair
with
such
finished
composure
had
snubbed
him
in
her
drawing
-
room
in
hamptonshire
square
'
you
are
surprised
at
this
of
course
you
are
she
said
in
a
low
pleading
voice
languidly
lifting
her
heavy
eyelids
while
he
was
holding
her
hand
but
i
could
not
help
it
i
know
i
have
done
something
to
offend
you
have
i
not
o
what
can
it
be
that
you
have
come
away
to
this
outlandish
rock
to
live
with
barbarians
in
the
midst
of
the
london
season
'
you
have
not
offended
me
dear
mrs
pine
-
avon
he
said
how
sorry
i
am
that
you
should
have
supposed
it
yet
i
am
glad
too
that
your
fancy
should
have
done
me
the
good
turn
of
bringing
you
here
to
see
me
'
i
am
staying
at
budmouth
-
regis
she
explained
'
then
i
did
see
you
at
a
church
-
service
here
a
little
while
back
she
blushed
faintly
upon
her
pallor
and
she
sighed
their
eyes
met
well
she
said
at
last
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
not
show
the
virtue
of
candour
you
know
what
it
means
i
was
the
stronger
once
now
i
am
the
weaker
whatever
pain
i
may
have
given
you
in
the
ups
and
downs
of
our
acquaintance
i
am
sorry
for
and
would
willingly
repair
all
errors
of
the
past
by
being
amenable
to
reason
in
the
future
it
was
impossible
that
jocelyn
should
not
feel
a
tender
impulsion
towards
this
attractive
and
once
independent
woman
who
from
every
worldly
point
of
view
was
an
excellent
match
for
him
a
superior
match
indeed
except
in
money
he
took
her
hand
again
and
held
it
awhile
and
a
faint
wave
of
gladness
seemed
to
flow
through
her
but
no
he
could
go
no
further
that
island
girl
in
her
coquettish
sunday
frock
and
little
hat
with
its
bunch
of
cock
'
s
feathers
held
him
as
by
strands
of
manila
rope
he
dropped
nichola
'
s
hand
'
i
am
leaving
budmouth
to
-
morrow
she
said
that
was
why
i
felt
i
must
call
you
did
not
know
i
had
been
there
all
through
the
whitsun
holidays
'
i
did
not
indeed
or
i
should
have
come
to
see
you
'
i
did
not
like
to
write
i
wish
i
had
now
'
i
wish
you
had
too
dear
mrs
pine
-
avon
but
it
was
'
nichola
'
that
she
wanted
to
be
as
they
reached
the
landau
he
told
her
that
he
should
be
back
in
town
himself
again
soon
and
would
call
immediately
at
the
moment
of
his
words
avice
caro
now
alone
passed
close
along
by
the
carriage
on
the
other
side
towards
her
house
hard
at
hand
she
did
not
turn
head
or
eye
to
the
pair
they
seemed
to
be
in
her
view
objects
of
indifference
pierston
became
cold
as
a
stone
the
chill
towards
nichola
that
the
presence
of
the
girl
sprite
witch
troll
that
she
was
brought
with
it
came
like
a
doom
he
knew
what
a
fool
he
was
as
he
had
said
but
he
was
powerless
in
the
grasp
of
the
idealizing
passion
he
cared
more
for
avice
'
s
finger
-
tips
than
for
mrs
pine
-
avon
'
s
whole
personality
perhaps
nichola
saw
it
for
she
said
mournfully
now
i
have
done
all
i
could
i
felt
that
the
only
counterpoise
to
my
cruelty
to
you
in
my
drawing
-
room
would
be
to
come
as
a
suppliant
to
yours
'
it
is
most
handsome
and
noble
of
you
my
very
dear
friend
said
he
with
an
emotion
of
courtesy
rather
than
of
enthusiasm
then
adieux
were
spoken
and
she
drove
away
but
pierston
saw
only
the
retreating
avice
and
knew
that
he
was
helpless
in
her
hands
the
church
of
the
island
had
risen
near
the
foundations
of
the
pagan
temple
and
a
christian
emanation
from
the
former
might
be
wrathfully
torturing
him
through
the
very
false
gods
to
whom
he
had
devoted
himself
both
in
his
craft
like
demetrius
of
ephesus
and
in
his
heart
perhaps
divine
punishment
for
his
idolatries
had
come
pierston
had
not
turned
far
back
towards
the
castle
when
he
was
overtaken
by
somers
and
the
man
who
carried
his
painting
lumber
they
paced
together
to
the
door
the
man
deposited
the
articles
and
went
away
and
the
two
walked
up
and
down
before
entering
'
i
met
an
extremely
interesting
woman
in
the
road
out
there
said
the
painter
'
ah
she
is
a
sprite
a
sylph
psyche
indeed
'
i
was
struck
with
her
'
it
shows
how
beauty
will
out
through
the
homeliest
guise
'
yes
it
will
though
not
always
and
this
case
does
not
prove
it
for
the
lady
'
s
attire
was
in
the
latest
and
most
approved
taste
'
oh
you
mean
the
lady
who
was
driving
'
of
course
what
were
you
thinking
of
the
pretty
little
cottage
-
girl
outside
here
i
did
meet
her
but
what
'
s
she
very
well
for
one
'
s
picture
though
hardly
for
one
'
s
fireside
this
lady
'
is
mrs
pine
-
avon
a
kind
proud
woman
who
will
do
what
people
with
no
pride
would
not
condescend
to
think
of
she
is
leaving
budmouth
to
-
morrow
and
she
drove
across
to
see
me
you
know
how
things
seemed
to
be
going
with
us
at
one
time
but
i
am
no
good
to
any
woman
she
is
been
very
generous
towards
me
which
i
'
ve
not
been
to
her
she
will
ultimately
throw
herself
away
upon
some
wretch
unworthy
of
her
no
doubt
'
do
you
think
so
murmured
somers
after
a
while
he
said
abruptly
i
will
marry
her
myself
if
she
will
have
me
i
like
the
look
of
her
'
i
wish
you
would
alfred
or
rather
could
she
has
long
had
an
idea
of
slipping
out
of
the
world
of
fashion
into
the
world
of
art
she
is
a
woman
of
individuality
and
earnest
instincts
i
am
in
real
trouble
about
her
i
wo
not
say
she
can
be
won
it
would
be
ungenerous
of
me
to
say
that
but
try
i
can
bring
you
together
easily
'
i
will
marry
her
if
she
is
willing
with
the
phlegmatic
dogmatism
that
was
part
of
him
somers
added
when
you
have
decided
to
marry
take
the
first
nice
woman
you
meet
they
are
all
alike
'
well
you
do
not
know
her
yet
replied
jocelyn
who
could
give
praise
where
he
could
not
give
love
'
but
you
do
and
i
will
take
her
on
the
strength
of
your
judgment
is
she
really
handsome
i
had
but
the
merest
glance
but
i
know
she
is
or
she
would
not
have
caught
your
discriminating
eye
'
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
she
looks
as
well
at
hand
as
afar
'
what
colour
are
her
eyes
'
her
eyes
i
do
not
go
much
in
for
colour
being
professionally
sworn
to
form
but
let
me
see
grey
and
her
hair
rather
light
than
dark
brown
'
i
wanted
something
darker
said
somers
airily
there
are
so
many
fair
models
among
native
englishwomen
still
blondes
are
useful
property
well
well
this
is
flippancy
but
i
liked
the
look
of
her
somers
had
gone
back
to
town
it
was
a
wet
day
on
the
little
peninsula
but
pierston
walked
out
as
far
as
the
garden
-
house
of
his
hired
castle
where
he
sat
down
and
smoked
this
erection
being
on
the
boundary
-
wall
of
his
property
his
ear
could
now
and
then
catch
the
tones
of
avice
'
s
voice
from
her
open
-
doored
cottage
in
the
lane
which
skirted
his
fence
and
he
noticed
that
there
were
no
modulations
in
it
he
knew
why
that
was
she
wished
to
go
out
and
could
not
he
had
observed
before
that
when
she
was
planning
an
outing
a
particular
note
would
come
into
her
voice
during
the
preceding
hours
a
dove
'
s
roundness
of
sound
no
doubt
the
effect
upon
her
voice
of
her
thoughts
of
her
lover
or
lovers
yet
the
latter
it
could
not
be
she
was
pure
and
singlehearted
half
an
eye
could
see
that
whence
then
the
two
men
possibly
the
quarrier
was
a
relation
there
seemed
reason
in
this
when
going
out
into
the
lane
he
encountered
one
of
the
red
jackets
he
had
been
thinking
of
soldiers
were
seldom
seen
in
this
outer
part
of
the
isle
their
beat
from
the
forts
when
on
pleasure
was
in
the
opposite
direction
and
this
man
must
have
had
a
special
reason
for
coming
hither
pierston
surveyed
him
he
was
a
round
-
faced
good
-
humoured
fellow
to
look
at
having
two
little
pieces
of
moustache
on
his
upper
lip
like
a
pair
of
minnows
rampant
and
small
black
eyes
over
which
the
glengarry
cap
straddled
flat
it
was
a
hateful
idea
that
her
tender
cheek
should
be
kissed
by
the
lips
of
this
heavy
young
man
who
had
never
been
sublimed
by
a
single
battle
even
with
defenceless
savages
the
soldier
went
before
her
house
looked
at
the
door
and
moved
on
down
the
crooked
way
to
the
cliffs
where
there
was
a
path
back
to
the
forts
but
he
did
not
adopt
it
returning
by
the
way
he
had
come
this
showed
his
wish
to
pass
the
house
again
she
gave
no
sign
however
and
the
soldier
disappeared
pierston
could
not
be
satisfied
that
avice
was
in
the
house
and
he
crossed
over
to
the
front
of
her
little
freehold
and
tapped
at
the
door
which
stood
ajar
nobody
came
hearing
a
slight
movement
within
he
crossed
the
threshold
avice
was
there
alone
sitting
on
a
low
stool
in
a
dark
corner
as
though
she
wished
to
be
unobserved
by
any
casual
passer
-
by
she
looked
up
at
him
without
emotion
or
apparent
surprise
but
he
could
then
see
that
she
was
crying
the
view
for
the
first
time
of
distress
in
an
unprotected
young
girl
towards
whom
he
felt
drawn
by
ties
of
extraordinary
delicacy
and
tenderness
moved
pierston
beyond
measure
he
entered
without
ceremony
'
avice
my
dear
girl
he
said
something
is
the
matter
she
looked
assent
and
he
went
on
now
tell
me
all
about
it
perhaps
i
can
help
you
come
tell
me
'
i
ca
not
she
murmured
grammer
stockwool
is
upstairs
and
she
will
hear
mrs
stockwool
was
the
old
woman
who
had
come
to
live
with
the
girl
for
company
since
her
mother
'
s
death
'
then
come
into
my
garden
opposite
there
we
shall
be
quite
private
she
rose
put
on
her
hat
and
accompanied
him
to
the
door
here
she
asked
him
if
the
lane
were
empty
and
on
his
assuring
her
that
it
was
she
crossed
over
and
entered
with
him
through
the
garden
-
wall
the
place
was
a
shady
and
secluded
one
though
through
the
boughs
the
sea
could
be
seen
quite
near
at
hand
its
moanings
being
distinctly
audible
a
water
-
drop
from
a
tree
fell
here
and
there
but
the
rain
was
not
enough
to
hurt
them
'
now
let
me
hear
it
he
said
soothingly
you
may
tell
me
with
the
greatest
freedom
i
was
a
friend
of
your
mother
'
s
you
know
that
is
i
knew
her
and
i
will
be
a
friend
of
yours
the
statement
was
risky
if
he
wished
her
not
to
suspect
him
of
being
her
mother
'
s
false
one
but
that
lover
'
s
name
appeared
to
be
unknown
to
the
present
avice
'
i
ca
not
tell
you
sir
she
replied
unwillingly
except
that
it
has
to
do
with
my
own
changeableness
the
rest
is
the
secret
of
somebody
else
'
i
am
sorry
for
that
said
he
'
i
am
getting
to
care
for
one
i
ought
not
to
think
of
and
it
means
ruin
i
ought
to
get
away
'
you
mean
from
the
island
'
yes
pierston
reflected
his
presence
in
london
had
been
desired
for
some
time
yet
he
had
delayed
going
because
of
his
new
solicitudes
here
but
to
go
and
take
her
with
him
would
afford
him
opportunity
of
watching
over
her
tending
her
mind
and
developing
it
while
it
might
remove
her
from
some
looming
danger
it
was
a
somewhat
awkward
guardianship
for
him
as
a
lonely
man
to
carry
out
still
it
could
be
done
he
asked
her
abruptly
if
she
would
really
like
to
go
away
for
a
while
'
i
like
best
to
stay
here
she
answered
still
i
should
not
mind
going
somewhere
because
i
think
i
ought
to
'
would
you
like
london
avice
'
s
face
lost
its
weeping
shape
how
could
that
be
she
said
'
i
have
been
thinking
that
you
could
come
to
my
house
and
make
yourself
useful
in
some
way
i
rent
just
now
one
of
those
new
places
called
flats
which
you
may
have
heard
of
and
i
have
a
studio
at
the
back
'
i
have
not
heard
of
'
em
she
said
without
interest
'
well
i
have
two
servants
there
and
as
my
man
has
a
holiday
you
can
help
them
for
a
month
or
two
'
would
polishing
furniture
be
any
good
i
can
do
that
'
i
have
not
much
furniture
that
requires
polishing
but
you
can
clear
away
plaster
and
clay
messes
in
the
studio
and
chippings
of
stone
and
help
me
in
modelling
and
dust
all
my
venus
failures
and
hands
and
heads
and
feet
and
bones
and
other
objects
she
was
startled
yet
attracted
by
the
novelty
of
the
proposal
'
only
for
a
time
she
said
'
only
for
a
time
as
short
as
you
like
and
as
long
the
deliberate
manner
in
which
after
the
first
surprise
avice
discussed
the
arrangements
that
he
suggested
might
have
told
him
how
far
was
any
feeling
for
himself
beyond
friendship
and
possibly
gratitude
from
agitating
her
breast
yet
there
was
nothing
extravagant
in
the
discrepancy
between
their
ages
and
he
hoped
after
shaping
her
to
himself
to
win
her
what
had
grieved
her
to
tears
she
would
not
more
particularly
tell
she
had
naturally
not
much
need
of
preparation
but
she
made
even
less
preparation
than
he
would
have
expected
her
to
require
she
seemed
eager
to
be
off
immediately
and
not
a
soul
was
to
know
of
her
departure
why
if
she
were
in
love
and
at
first
averse
to
leave
the
island
she
should
be
so
precipitate
now
he
failed
to
understand
but
he
took
great
care
to
compromise
in
no
way
a
girl
in
whom
his
interest
was
as
protective
as
it
was
passionate
he
accordingly
left
her
to
get
out
of
the
island
alone
awaiting
her
at
a
station
a
few
miles
up
the
railway
where
discovering
himself
to
her
through
the
carriage
-
window
he
entered
the
next
compartment
his
frame
pervaded
by
a
glow
which
was
almost
joy
at
having
for
the
first
time
in
his
charge
one
who
inherited
the
flesh
and
bore
the
name
so
early
associated
with
his
own
and
at
the
prospect
of
putting
things
right
which
had
been
wrong
through
many
years
it
was
dark
when
the
four
-
wheeled
cab
wherein
he
had
brought
avice
from
the
station
stood
at
the
entrance
to
the
pile
of
flats
of
which
pierston
occupied
one
floor
rarer
then
as
residences
in
london
than
they
are
now
leaving
avice
to
alight
and
get
the
luggage
taken
in
by
the
porter
pierston
went
upstairs
to
his
surprise
his
floor
was
silent
and
on
entering
with
a
latchkey
the
rooms
were
all
in
darkness
he
descended
to
the
hall
where
avice
was
standing
helpless
beside
the
luggage
while
the
porter
was
outside
with
the
cabman
'
do
you
know
what
has
become
of
my
servants
asked
jocelyn
'
what
and
ai
not
they
there
saur
ah
then
my
belief
is
that
what
i
suspected
is
thrue
you
did
not
leave
your
wine
-
cellar
unlocked
did
you
saur
by
no
mistake
pierston
considered
he
thought
he
might
have
left
the
key
with
his
elder
servant
whom
he
had
believed
he
could
trust
especially
as
the
cellar
was
not
well
stocked
'
ah
then
it
was
so
she
is
been
very
queer
saur
this
last
week
or
two
o
yes
sending
messages
down
the
spakin
'

tube
which
were
like
madness
itself
and
ordering
us

and
that
till
we
would
take
