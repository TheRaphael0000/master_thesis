can
i
believe
what
you
tell
me
it
is
like
a
tale
for
men
that
listen
only
half
awake
by
the
camp
fire
and
it
seems
to
have
run
off
a
woman
'
s
tongue
who
is
there
here
for
me
to
deceive
o
rajah
answered
babalatchi
without
you
i
am
nothing
all
i
have
told
you
i
believe
to
be
true
i
have
been
safe
for
many
years
in
the
hollow
of
your
hand
this
is
no
time
to
harbour
suspicions
the
danger
is
very
great
we
should
advise
and
act
at
once
before
the
sun
sets
right
right
muttered
lakamba
pensively
they
had
been
sitting
for
the
last
hour
together
in
the
audience
chamber
of
the
rajah
'
s
house
for
babalatchi
as
soon
as
he
had
witnessed
the
landing
of
the
dutch
officers
had
crossed
the
river
to
report
to
his
master
the
events
of
the
morning
and
to
confer
with
him
upon
the
line
of
conduct
to
pursue
in
the
face
of
altered
circumstances
they
were
both
puzzled
and
frightened
by
the
unexpected
turn
the
events
had
taken
the
rajah
sitting
crosslegged
on
his
chair
looked
fixedly
at
the
floor
babalatchi
was
squatting
close
by
in
an
attitude
of
deep
dejection
and
where
did
you
say
he
is
hiding
now
asked
lakamba
breaking
at
last
the
silence
full
of
gloomy
forebodings
in
which
they
both
had
been
lost
for
a
long
while
in
bulangi
'
s
clearing
the
furthest
one
away
from
the
house
they
went
there
that
very
night
the
white
man
'
s
daughter
took
him
there
she
told
me
so
herself
speaking
to
me
openly
for
she
is
half
white
and
has
no
decency
she
said
she
was
waiting
for
him
while
he
was
here
then
after
a
long
time
he
came
out
of
the
darkness
and
fell
at
her
feet
exhausted
he
lay
like
one
dead
but
she
brought
him
back
to
life
in
her
arms
and
made
him
breathe
again
with
her
own
breath
that
is
what
she
said
speaking
to
my
face
as
i
am
speaking
now
to
you
rajah
she
is
like
a
white
woman
and
knows
no
shame
he
paused
deeply
shocked
lakamba
nodded
his
head
well
and
then
he
asked
they
called
the
old
woman
went
on
babalatchi
and
he
told
them
all
about
the
brig
and
how
he
tried
to
kill
many
men
he
knew
the
orang
blanda
were
very
near
although
he
had
said
nothing
to
us
about
that
he
knew
his
great
danger
he
thought
he
had
killed
many
but
there
were
only
two
dead
as
i
have
heard
from
the
men
of
the
sea
that
came
in
the
warship
'
s
boats
and
the
other
man
he
that
was
found
in
the
river
interrupted
lakamba
that
was
one
of
his
boatmen
when
his
canoe
was
overturned
by
the
logs
those
two
swam
together
but
the
other
man
must
have
been
hurt
dain
swam
holding
him
up
he
left
him
in
the
bushes
when
he
went
up
to
the
house
when
they
all
came
down
his
heart
had
ceased
to
beat
then
the
old
woman
spoke
dain
thought
it
was
good
he
took
off
his
anklet
and
broke
it
twisting
it
round
the
man
'
s
foot
his
ring
he
put
on
that
slave
'
s
hand
he
took
off
his
sarong
and
clothed
that
thing
that
wanted
no
clothes
the
two
women
holding
it
up
meanwhile
their
intent
being
to
deceive
all
eyes
and
to
mislead
the
minds
in
the
settlement
so
that
they
could
swear
to
the
thing
that
was
not
and
that
there
could
be
no
treachery
when
the
white
-
men
came
then
dain
and
the
white
woman
departed
to
call
up
bulangi
and
find
a
hiding
-
place
the
old
woman
remained
by
the
body
hai
exclaimed
lakamba
she
has
wisdom
yes
she
has
a
devil
of
her
own
to
whisper
counsel
in
her
ear
assented
babalatchi
she
dragged
the
body
with
great
toil
to
the
point
where
many
logs
were
stranded
all
these
things
were
done
in
the
darkness
after
the
storm
had
passed
away
then
she
waited
at
the
first
sign
of
daylight
she
battered
the
face
of
the
dead
with
a
heavy
stone
and
she
pushed
him
amongst
the
logs
she
remained
near
watching
at
sunrise
mahmat
banjer
came
and
found
him
they
all
believed
i
myself
was
deceived
but
not
for
long
the
white
man
believed
and
grieving
fled
to
his
house
when
we
were
alone
i
having
doubts
spoke
to
the
woman
and
she
fearing
my
anger
and
your
might
told
me
all
asking
for
help
in
saving
dain
he
must
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
orang
blanda
said
lakamba
but
let
him
die
if
the
thing
can
be
done
quietly
it
cannot
tuan
remember
there
is
that
woman
who
being
half
white
is
ungovernable
and
would
raise
a
great
outcry
also
the
officers
are
here
they
are
angry
enough
already
dain
must
escape
he
must
go
we
must
help
him
now
for
our
own
safety
are
the
officers
very
angry
inquired
lakamba
with
interest
they
are
the
principal
chief
used
strong
words
when
speaking
to
me
to
me
when
i
salaamed
in
your
name
i
do
not
think
added
babalatchi
after
a
short
pause
and
looking
very
worried
i
do
not
think
i
saw
a
white
chief
so
angry
before
he
said
we
were
careless
or
even
worse
he
told
me
he
would
speak
to
the
rajah
and
that
i
was
of
no
account
speak
to
the
rajah
repeated
lakamba
thoughtfully
listen
babalatchi
i
am
sick
and
shall
withdraw
you
cross
over
and
tell
the
white
men
yes
said
babalatchi
i
am
going
over
at
once
and
as
to
dain
you
get
him
away
as
you
can
best
this
is
a
great
trouble
in
my
heart
sighed
lakamba
babalatchi
got
up
and
going
close
to
his
master
spoke
earnestly
there
is
one
of
our
praus
at
the
southern
mouth
of
the
river
the
dutch
warship
is
to
the
northward
watching
the
main
entrance
i
shall
send
dain
off
to
-
night
in
a
canoe
by
the
hidden
channels
on
board
the
prau
his
father
is
a
great
prince
and
shall
hear
of
our
generosity
let
the
prau
take
him
to
ampanam
your
glory
shall
be
great
and
your
reward
in
powerful
friendship
almayer
will
no
doubt
deliver
the
dead
body
as
dain
'
s
to
the
officers
and
the
foolish
white
men
shall
say
'
this
is
very
good
let
there
be
peace
and
the
trouble
shall
be
removed
from
your
heart
rajah
true
true
said
lakamba
and
this
being
accomplished
by
me
who
am
your
slave
you
shall
reward
with
a
generous
hand
that
i
know
the
white
man
is
grieving
for
the
lost
treasure
in
the
manner
of
white
men
who
thirst
after
dollars
now
when
all
other
things
are
in
order
we
shall
perhaps
obtain
the
treasure
from
the
white
man
dain
must
escape
and
almayer
must
live
now
go
babalatchi
go
said
lakamba
getting
off
his
chair
i
am
very
sick
and
want
medicine
tell
the
white
chief
so
but
babalatchi
was
not
to
be
got
rid
of
in
this
summary
manner
he
knew
that
his
master
after
the
manner
of
the
great
liked
to
shift
the
burden
of
toil
and
danger
on
to
his
servants
'
shoulders
but
in
the
difficult
straits
in
which
they
were
now
the
rajah
must
play
his
part
he
may
be
very
sick
for
the
white
men
for
all
the
world
if
he
liked
as
long
as
he
would
take
upon
himself
the
execution
of
part
at
least
of
babalatchi
'
s
carefully
thought
-
of
plan
babalatchi
wanted
a
big
canoe
manned
by
twelve
men
to
be
sent
out
after
dark
towards
bulangi
'
s
clearing
dain
may
have
to
be
overpowered
a
man
in
love
cannot
be
expected
to
see
clearly
the
path
of
safety
if
it
leads
him
away
from
the
object
of
his
affections
argued
babalatchi
and
in
that
case
they
would
have
to
use
force
in
order
to
make
him
go
would
the
rajah
see
that
trusty
men
manned
the
canoe
the
thing
must
be
done
secretly
perhaps
the
rajah
would
come
himself
so
as
to
bring
all
the
weight
of
his
authority
to
bear
upon
dain
if
he
should
prove
obstinate
and
refuse
to
leave
his
hiding
-
place
the
rajah
would
not
commit
himself
to
a
definite
promise
and
anxiously
pressed
babalatchi
to
go
being
afraid
of
the
white
men
paying
him
an
unexpected
visit
the
aged
statesman
reluctantly
took
his
leave
and
went
into
the
courtyard
before
going
down
to
his
boat
babalatchi
stopped
for
a
while
in
the
big
open
space
where
the
thick
-
leaved
trees
put
black
patches
of
shadow
which
seemed
to
float
on
a
flood
of
smooth
intense
light
that
rolled
up
to
the
houses
and
down
to
the
stockade
and
over
the
river
where
it
broke
and
sparkled
in
thousands
of
glittering
wavelets
like
a
band
woven
of
azure
and
gold
edged
with
the
brilliant
green
of
the
forests
guarding
both
banks
of
the
pantai
in
the
perfect
calm
before
the
coming
of
the
afternoon
breeze
the
irregularly
jagged
line
of
tree
-
tops
stood
unchanging
as
if
traced
by
an
unsteady
hand
on
the
clear
blue
of
the
hot
sky
in
the
space
sheltered
by
the
high
palisades
there
lingered
the
smell
of
decaying
blossoms
from
the
surrounding
forest
a
taint
of
drying
fish
with
now
and
then
a
whiff
of
acrid
smoke
from
the
cooking
fires
when
it
eddied
down
from
under
the
leafy
boughs
and
clung
lazily
about
the
burnt
-
up
grass
as
babalatchi
looked
up
at
the
flagstaff
over
-
topping
a
group
of
low
trees
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
the
tricolour
flag
of
the
netherlands
stirred
slightly
for
the
first
time
since
it
had
been
hoisted
that
morning
on
the
arrival
of
the
man
-
of
-
war
boats
with
a
faint
rustle
of
trees
the
breeze
came
down
in
light
puffs
playing
capriciously
for
a
time
with
this
emblem
of
lakamba
'
s
power
that
was
also
the
mark
of
his
servitude
then
the
breeze
freshened
in
a
sharp
gust
of
wind
and
the
flag
flew
out
straight
and
steady
above
the
trees
a
dark
shadow
ran
along
the
river
rolling
over
and
covering
up
the
sparkle
of
declining
sunlight
a
big
white
cloud
sailed
slowly
across
the
darkening
sky
and
hung
to
the
westward
as
if
waiting
for
the
sun
to
join
it
there
men
and
things
shook
off
the
torpor
of
the
hot
afternoon
and
stirred
into
life
under
the
first
breath
of
the
sea
breeze
babalatchi
hurried
down
to
the
water
-
gate
yet
before
he
passed
through
it
he
paused
to
look
round
the
courtyard
with
its
light
and
shade
with
its
cheery
fires
with
the
groups
of
lakamba
'
s
soldiers
and
retainers
scattered
about
his
own
house
stood
amongst
the
other
buildings
in
that
enclosure
and
the
statesman
of
sambir
asked
himself
with
a
sinking
heart
when
and
how
would
it
be
given
him
to
return
to
that
house
he
had
to
deal
with
a
man
more
dangerous
than
any
wild
beast
of
his
experience
a
proud
man
a
man
wilful
after
the
manner
of
princes
a
man
in
love
and
he
was
going
forth
to
speak
to
that
man
words
of
cold
and
worldly
wisdom
could
anything
be
more
appalling
what
if
that
man
should
take
umbrage
at
some
fancied
slight
to
his
honour
or
disregard
of
his
affections
and
suddenly
amok
the
wise
adviser
would
be
the
first
victim
no
doubt
and
death
would
be
his
reward
and
underlying
the
horror
of
this
situation
there
was
the
danger
of
those
meddlesome
fools
the
white
men
a
vision
of
comfortless
exile
in
far
-
off
madura
rose
up
before
babalatchi
would
not
that
be
worse
than
death
itself
and
there
was
that
half
-
white
woman
with
threatening
eyes
how
could
he
tell
what
an
incomprehensible
creature
of
that
sort
would
or
would
not
do
she
knew
so
much
that
she
made
the
killing
of
dain
an
impossibility
that
much
was
certain
and
yet
the
sharp
rough
-
edged
kriss
is
a
good
and
discreet
friend
thought
babalatchi
as
he
examined
his
own
lovingly
and
put
it
back
in
the
sheath
with
a
sigh
of
regret
before
unfastening
his
canoe
as
he
cast
off
the
painter
pushed
out
into
the
stream
and
took
up
his
paddle
he
realised
vividly
how
unsatisfactory
it
was
to
have
women
mixed
up
in
state
affairs
young
women
of
course
for
mrs
almayer
'
s
mature
wisdom
and
for
the
easy
aptitude
in
intrigue
that
comes
with
years
to
the
feminine
mind
he
felt
the
most
sincere
respect
he
paddled
leisurely
letting
the
canoe
drift
down
as
he
crossed
towards
the
point
the
sun
was
high
yet
and
nothing
pressed
his
work
would
commence
only
with
the
coming
of
darkness
avoiding
the
lingard
jetty
he
rounded
the
point
and
paddled
up
the
creek
at
the
back
of
almayer
'
s
house
there
were
many
canoes
lying
there
their
noses
all
drawn
together
fastened
all
to
the
same
stake
babalatchi
pushed
his
little
craft
in
amongst
them
and
stepped
on
shore
on
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
something
moved
in
the
grass
who
'
s
that
hiding
hailed
babalatchi
come
out
and
speak
to
me
nobody
answered
babalatchi
crossed
over
passing
from
boat
to
boat
and
poked
his
staff
viciously
in
the
suspicious
place
taminah
jumped
up
with
a
cry
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
surprised
i
have
nearly
stepped
on
your
tray
am
i
a
dyak
that
you
should
hide
at
my
sight
i
was
weary
and
i
slept
whispered
taminah
confusedly
you
slept
you
have
not
sold
anything
to
-
day
and
you
will
be
beaten
when
you
return
home
said
babalatchi
taminah
stood
before
him
abashed
and
silent
babalatchi
looked
her
over
carefully
with
great
satisfaction
decidedly
he
would
offer
fifty
dollars
more
to
that
thief
bulangi
the
girl
pleased
him
now
you
go
home
it
is
late
he
said
sharply
tell
bulangi
that
i
shall
be
near
his
house
before
the
night
is
half
over
and
that
i
want
him
to
make
all
things
ready
for
a
long
journey
you
understand
a
long
journey
to
the
southward
tell
him
that
before
sunset
and
do
not
forget
my
words
taminah
made
a
gesture
of
assent
and
watched
babalatchi
recross
the
ditch
and
disappear
through
the
bushes
bordering
almayer
'
s
compound
she
moved
a
little
further
off
the
creek
and
sank
in
the
grass
again
lying
down
on
her
face
shivering
in
dry
-
eyed
misery
babalatchi
walked
straight
towards
the
cooking
-
shed
looking
for
mrs
almayer
the
courtyard
was
in
a
great
uproar
a
strange
chinaman
had
possession
of
the
kitchen
fire
and
was
noisily
demanding
another
saucepan
he
hurled
objurgations
in
the
canton
dialect
and
bad
malay
against
the
group
of
slave
-
girls
standing
a
little
way
off
half
frightened
half
amused
at
his
violence
from
the
camping
fires
round
which
the
seamen
of
the
frigate
were
sitting
came
words
of
encouragement
mingled
with
laughter
and
jeering
in
the
midst
of
this
noise
and
confusion
babalatchi
met
ali
an
empty
dish
in
his
hand
where
are
the
white
men
asked
babalatchi
they
are
eating
in
the
front
verandah
answered
ali
do
not
stop
me
tuan
i
am
giving
the
white
men
their
food
and
am
busy
where
'
s
mem
almayer
inside
in
the
passage
she
is
listening
to
the
talk
ali
grinned
and
passed
on
babalatchi
ascended
the
plankway
to
the
rear
verandah
and
beckoning
out
mrs
almayer
engaged
her
in
earnest
conversation
through
the
long
passage
closed
at
the
further
end
by
the
red
curtain
they
could
hear
from
time
to
time
almayer
'
s
voice
mingling
in
conversation
with
an
abrupt
loudness
that
made
mrs
almayer
look
significantly
at
babalatchi
listen
she
said
he
has
drunk
much
he
has
whispered
babalatchi
he
will
sleep
heavily
to
-
night
mrs
almayer
looked
doubtful
sometimes
the
devil
of
strong
gin
makes
him
keep
awake
and
he
walks
up
and
down
the
verandah
all
night
cursing
then
we
stand
afar
off
explained
mrs
almayer
with
the
fuller
knowledge
born
of
twenty
odd
years
of
married
life
but
then
he
does
not
hear
nor
understand
and
his
hand
of
course
has
no
strength
we
do
not
want
him
to
hear
to
-
night
no
assented
mrs
almayer
energetically
but
in
a
cautiously
subdued
voice
if
he
hears
he
will
kill
babalatchi
looked
incredulous
hai
tuan
you
may
believe
me
have
i
not
lived
many
years
with
that
man
have
i
not
seen
death
in
that
man
'
s
eyes
more
than
once
when
i
was
younger
and
he
guessed
at
many
things
had
he
been
a
man
of
my
own
people
i
would
not
have
seen
such
a
look
twice
but
he
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
she
seemed
to
fling
unutterable
scorn
on
almayer
'
s
weak
-
minded
aversion
to
sudden
bloodshed
if
he
has
the
wish
but
not
the
strength
then
what
do
we
fear
asked
babalatchi
after
a
short
silence
during
which
they
both
listened
to
almayer
'
s
loud
talk
till
it
subsided
into
the
murmur
of
general
conversation
what
do
we
fear
repeated
babalatchi
again
to
keep
the
daughter
whom
he
loves
he
would
strike
into
your
heart
and
mine
without
hesitation
said
mrs
almayer
when
the
girl
is
gone
he
will
be
like
the
devil
unchained
then
you
and
i
had
better
beware
i
am
an
old
man
and
fear
not
death
answered
babalatchi
with
a
mendacious
assumption
of
indifference
but
what
will
you
do
i
am
an
old
woman
and
wish
to
live
retorted
mrs
almayer
she
is
my
daughter
also
i
shall
seek
safety
at
the
feet
of
our
rajah
speaking
in
the
name
of
the
past
when
we
both
were
young
and
he
babalatchi
raised
his
hand
enough
you
shall
be
protected
he
said
soothingly
again
the
sound
of
almayer
'
s
voice
was
heard
and
again
interrupting
their
talk
they
listened
to
the
confused
but
loud
utterance
coming
in
bursts
of
unequal
strength
with
unexpected
pauses
and
noisy
repetitions
that
made
some
words
and
sentences
fall
clear
and
distinct
on
their
ears
out
of
the
meaningless
jumble
of
excited
shoutings
emphasised
by
the
thumping
of
almayer
'
s
fist
upon
the
table
on
the
short
intervals
of
silence
the
high
complaining
note
of
tumblers
standing
close
together
and
vibrating
to
the
shock
lingered
growing
fainter
till
it
leapt
up
again
into
tumultuous
ringing
when
a
new
idea
started
a
new
rush
of
words
and
brought
down
the
heavy
hand
again
at
last
the
quarrelsome
shouting
ceased
and
the
thin
plaint
of
disturbed
glass
died
away
into
reluctant
quietude
babalatchi
and
mrs
almayer
had
listened
curiously
their
bodies
bent
and
their
ears
turned
towards
the
passage
at
every
louder
shout
they
nodded
at
each
other
with
a
ridiculous
affectation
of
scandalised
propriety
and
they
remained
in
the
same
attitude
for
some
time
after
the
noise
had
ceased
this
is
the
devil
of
gin
whispered
mrs
almayer
yes
he
talks
like
that
sometimes
when
there
is
nobody
to
hear
him
what
does
he
say
inquired
babalatchi
eagerly
you
ought
to
understand
i
have
forgotten
their
talk
a
little
i
understood
he
spoke
without
any
respect
of
the
white
ruler
in
batavia
and
of
protection
and
said
he
had
been
wronged
he
said
that
several
times
more
i
did
not
understand
listen
again
he
speaks
tse
tse
tse
clicked
babalatchi
trying
to
appear
shocked
but
with
a
joyous
twinkle
of
his
solitary
eye
there
will
be
great
trouble
between
those
white
men
i
will
go
round
now
and
see
you
tell
your
daughter
that
there
is
a
sudden
and
a
long
journey
before
her
with
much
glory
and
splendour
at
the
end
and
tell
her
that
dain
must
go
or
he
must
die
and
that
he
will
not
go
alone
no
he
will
not
go
alone
slowly
repeated
mrs
almayer
with
a
thoughtful
air
as
she
crept
into
the
passage
after
seeing
babalatchi
disappear
round
the
corner
of
the
house
the
statesman
of
sambir
under
the
impulse
of
vivid
curiosity
made
his
way
quickly
to
the
front
of
the
house
but
once
there
he
moved
slowly
and
cautiously
as
he
crept
step
by
step
up
the
stairs
of
the
verandah
on
the
highest
step
he
sat
down
quietly
his
feet
on
the
steps
below
ready
for
flight
should
his
presence
prove
unwelcome
he
felt
pretty
safe
so
the
table
stood
nearly
endways
to
him
and
he
saw
almayer
'
s
back
at
nina
he
looked
full
face
and
had
a
side
view
of
both
officers
but
of
the
four
persons
sitting
at
the
table
only
nina
and
the
younger
officer
noticed
his
noiseless
arrival
the
momentary
dropping
of
nina
'
s
eyelids
acknowledged
babalatchi
'
s
presence
she
then
spoke
at
once
to
the
young
sub
who
turned
towards
her
with
attentive
alacrity
but
her
gaze
was
fastened
steadily
on
her
father
'
s
face
while
almayer
was
speaking
uproariously
disloyalty
and
unscrupulousness
what
have
you
ever
done
to
make
me
loyal
you
have
no
grip
on
this
country
i
had
to
take
care
of
myself
and
when
i
asked
for
protection
i
was
met
with
threats
and
contempt
and
had
arab
slander
thrown
in
my
face
i
a
white
man
do
not
be
violent
almayer
remonstrated
the
lieutenant
i
have
heard
all
this
already
then
why
do
you
talk
to
me
about
scruples
i
wanted
money
and
i
gave
powder
in
exchange
how
could
i
know
that
some
of
your
wretched
men
were
going
to
be
blown
up
scruples
pah
he
groped
unsteadily
amongst
the
bottles
trying
one
after
another
grumbling
to
himself
the
while
no
more
wine
he
muttered
discontentedly
you
have
had
enough
almayer
said
the
lieutenant
as
he
lighted
a
cigar
is
it
not
time
to
deliver
to
us
your
prisoner
i
take
it
you
have
that
dain
maroola
stowed
away
safely
somewhere
still
we
had
better
get
that
business
over
and
then
we
shall
have
more
drink
come
do
not
look
at
me
like
this
almayer
was
staring
with
stony
eyes
his
trembling
fingers
fumbling
about
his
throat
gold
he
said
with
difficulty
hem
a
hand
on
the
windpipe
you
know
sure
you
will
excuse
i
wanted
to
say
a
little
gold
for
a
little
powder
what
'
s
that
i
know
i
know
said
the
lieutenant
soothingly
no
you
do
not
know
not
one
of
you
knows
shouted
almayer
the
government
is
a
fool
i
tell
you
heaps
of
gold
i
am
the
man
that
knows
i
and
another
one
but
he
wo
not
speak
he
is
he
checked
himself
with
a
feeble
smile
and
making
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
pat
the
officer
on
the
shoulder
knocked
over
a
couple
of
empty
bottles
personally
you
are
a
fine
fellow
he
said
very
distinctly
in
a
patronising
manner
his
head
nodded
drowsily
as
he
sat
muttering
to
himself
the
two
officers
looked
at
each
other
helplessly
this
wo
not
do
said
the
lieutenant
addressing
his
junior
have
the
men
mustered
in
the
compound
here
i
must
get
some
sense
out
of
him
hi
almayer
wake
up
man
redeem
your
word
you
gave
your
word
you
gave
your
word
of
honour
you
know
almayer
shook
off
the
officer
'
s
hand
with
impatience
but
his
ill
-
humour
vanished
at
once
and
he
looked
up
putting
his
forefinger
to
the
side
of
his
nose
you
are
very
young
there
is
time
for
all
things
he
said
with
an
air
of
great
sagacity
the
lieutenant
turned
towards
nina
who
leaning
back
in
her
chair
watched
her
father
steadily
really
i
am
very
much
distressed
by
all
this
for
your
sake
he
exclaimed
i
do
not
know
he
went
on
speaking
with
some
embarrassment
whether
i
have
any
right
to
ask
you
anything
unless
perhaps
to
withdraw
from
this
painful
scene
but
i
feel
that
i
must
for
your
father
'
s
good
suggest
that
you
should
i
mean
if
you
have
any
influence
over
him
you
ought
to
exert
it
now
to
make
him
keep
the
promise
he
gave
me
before
he
before
he
got
into
this
state
he
observed
with
discouragement
that
she
seemed
not
to
take
any
notice
of
what
he
said
sitting
still
with
half
-
closed
eyes
i
trust
he
began
again
what
is
the
promise
you
speak
of
abruptly
asked
nina
leaving
her
seat
and
moving
towards
her
father
nothing
that
is
not
just
and
proper
he
promised
to
deliver
to
us
a
man
who
in
time
of
profound
peace
took
the
lives
of
innocent
men
to
escape
the
punishment
he
deserved
for
breaking
the
law
he
planned
his
mischief
on
a
large
scale
it
is
not
his
fault
if
it
failed
partially
of
course
you
have
heard
of
dain
maroola
your
father
secured
him
i
understand
we
know
he
escaped
up
this
river
perhaps
you
and
he
killed
white
men
interrupted
nina
i
regret
to
say
they
were
white
yes
two
white
men
lost
their
lives
through
that
scoundrel
'
s
freak
two
only
exclaimed
nina
the
officer
looked
at
her
in
amazement
why
why
you
-
he
stammered
confused
there
might
have
been
more
interrupted
nina
and
when
you
get
this
this
scoundrel
will
you
go
the
lieutenant
still
speechless
bowed
his
assent
then
i
would
get
him
for
you
if
i
had
to
seek
him
in
a
burning
fire
she
burst
out
with
intense
energy
i
hate
the
sight
of
your
white
faces
i
hate
the
sound
of
your
gentle
voices
that
is
the
way
you
speak
to
women
dropping
sweet
words
before
any
pretty
face
i
have
heard
your
voices
before
i
hoped
to
live
here
without
seeing
any
other
white
face
but
this
she
added
in
a
gentler
tone
touching
lightly
her
father
'
s
cheek
almayer
ceased
his
mumbling
and
opened
his
eyes
he
caught
hold
of
his
daughter
'
s
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
face
while
nina
with
the
other
hand
smoothed
his
rumpled
grey
hair
looking
defiantly
over
her
father
'
s
head
at
the
officer
who
had
now
regained
his
composure
and
returned
her
look
with
a
cool
steady
stare
below
in
front
of
the
verandah
they
could
hear
the
tramp
of
seamen
mustering
there
according
to
orders
the
sub
-
lieutenant
came
up
the
steps
while
babalatchi
stood
up
uneasily
and
with
finger
on
lip
tried
to
catch
nina
'
s
eye
you
are
a
good
girl
whispered
almayer
absently
dropping
his
daughter
'
s
hand
father
father
she
cried
bending
over
him
with
passionate
entreaty
see
those
two
men
looking
at
us
send
them
away
i
cannot
bear
it
any
more
send
them
away
do
what
they
want
and
let
them
go
she
caught
sight
of
babalatchi
and
ceased
speaking
suddenly
but
her
foot
tapped
the
floor
with
rapid
beats
in
a
paroxysm
of
nervous
restlessness
the
two
officers
stood
close
together
looking
on
curiously
what
has
happened
what
is
the
matter
whispered
the
younger
man
do
not
know
answered
the
other
under
his
breath
one
is
furious
and
the
other
is
drunk
not
so
drunk
either
queer
this
look
almayer
had
risen
holding
on
to
his
daughter
'
s
arm
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
he
let
go
his
hold
and
lurched
half
-
way
across
the
verandah
there
he
pulled
himself
together
and
stood
very
straight
breathing
hard
and
glaring
round
angrily
are
the
men
ready
asked
the
lieutenant
all
ready
sir
now
mr
almayer
lead
the
way
said
the
lieutenant
almayer
rested
his
eyes
on
him
as
if
he
saw
him
for
the
first
time
two
men
he
said
thickly
the
effort
of
speaking
seemed
to
interfere
with
his
equilibrium
he
took
a
quick
step
to
save
himself
from
a
fall
and
remained
swaying
backwards
and
forwards
two
men
he
began
again
speaking
with
difficulty
two
white
men
men
in
uniform
honourable
men
i
want
to
say
men
of
honour
are
you
come
none
of
that
said
the
officer
impatiently
let
us
have
that
friend
of
yours
what
do
you
think
i
am
asked
almayer
fiercely
you
are
drunk
but
not
so
drunk
as
not
to
know
what
you
are
doing
enough
of
this
tomfoolery
said
the
officer
sternly
or
i
will
have
you
put
under
arrest
in
your
own
house
arrest
laughed
almayer
discordantly
ha
ha
ha
arrest
why
i
have
been
trying
to
get
out
of
this
infernal
place
for
twenty
years
and
i
ca
not
you
hear
man
i
ca
not
and
never
shall
never
he
ended
his
words
with
a
sob
and
walked
unsteadily
down
the
stairs
when
in
the
courtyard
the
lieutenant
approached
him
and
took
him
by
the
arm
the
sub
-
lieutenant
and
babalatchi
followed
close
that
'
s
better
almayer
said
the
officer
encouragingly
where
are
you
going
to
there
are
only
planks
there
here
he
went
on
shaking
him
slightly
do
we
want
the
boats
no
answered
almayer
viciously
you
want
a
grave
what
wild
again
try
to
talk
sense
grave
roared
almayer
struggling
to
get
himself
free
a
hole
in
the
ground
do
not
you
understand
you
must
be
drunk
let
me
go
let
go
i
tell
you
he
tore
away
from
the
officer
'
s
grasp
and
reeled
towards
the
planks
where
the
body
lay
under
its
white
cover
then
he
turned
round
quickly
and
faced
the
semicircle
of
interested
faces
the
sun
was
sinking
rapidly
throwing
long
shadows
of
house
and
trees
over
the
courtyard
but
the
light
lingered
yet
on
the
river
where
the
logs
went
drifting
past
in
midstream
looking
very
distinct
and
black
in
the
pale
red
glow
the
trunks
of
the
trees
in
the
forest
on
the
east
bank
were
lost
in
gloom
while
their
highest
branches
swayed
gently
in
the
departing
sunlight
the
air
felt
heavy
and
cold
in
the
breeze
expiring
in
slight
puffs
that
came
over
the
water
almayer
shivered
as
he
made
an
effort
to
speak
and
again
with
an
uncertain
gesture
he
seemed
to
free
his
throat
from
the
grip
of
an
invisible
hand
his
bloodshot
eyes
wandered
aimlessly
from
face
to
face
there
he
said
at
last
are
you
all
there
he
is
a
dangerous
man
he
dragged
at
the
cover
with
hasty
violence
and
the
body
rolled
stiffly
off
the
planks
and
fell
at
his
feet
in
rigid
helplessness
cold
perfectly
cold
said
almayer
looking
round
with
a
mirthless
smile
sorry
can
do
no
better
and
you
ca
not
hang
him
either
as
you
observe
gentlemen
he
added
gravely
there
is
no
head
and
hardly
any
neck
the
last
ray
of
light
was
snatched
away
from
the
tree
-
tops
the
river
grew
suddenly
dark
and
in
the
great
stillness
the
murmur
of
the
flowing
water
seemed
to
fill
the
vast
expanse
of
grey
shadow
that
descended
upon
the
land
this
is
dain
went
on
almayer
to
the
silent
group
that
surrounded
him
and
i
have
kept
my
word
first
one
hope
then
another
and
this
is
my
last
nothing
is
left
now
you
think
there
is
one
dead
man
here
mistake
i
'
sure
you
i
am
much
more
dead
why
do
not
you
hang
me
he
suggested
suddenly
in
a
friendly
tone
addressing
the
lieutenant
i
assure
assure
you
it
would
be
a
mat
matter
of
form
altog
altogether
these
last
words
he
muttered
to
himself
and
walked
zigzaging
towards
his
house
get
out
he
thundered
at
ali
who
was
approaching
timidly
with
offers
of
assistance
from
afar
scared
groups
of
men
and
women
watched
his
devious
progress
he
dragged
himself
up
the
stairs
by
the
banister
and
managed
to
reach
a
chair
into
which
he
fell
heavily
he
sat
for
awhile
panting
with
exertion
and
anger
and
looking
round
vaguely
for
nina
then
making
a
threatening
gesture
towards
the
compound
where
he
had
heard
babalatchi
'
s
voice
he
overturned
the
table
with
his
foot
in
a
great
crash
of
smashed
crockery
he
muttered
yet
menacingly
to
himself
then
his
head
fell
on
his
breast
his
eyes
closed
and
with
a
deep
sigh
he
fell
asleep
that
night
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
the
peaceful
and
flourishing
settlement
of
sambir
saw
the
lights
shining
about
almayer
'
s
folly
these
were
the
lanterns
of
the
boats
hung
up
by
the
seamen
under
the
verandah
where
the
two
officers
were
holding
a
court
of
inquiry
into
the
truth
of
the
story
related
to
them
by
babalatchi
babalatchi
had
regained
all
his
importance
he
was
eloquent
and
persuasive
calling
heaven
and
earth
to
witness
the
truth
of
his
statements
there
were
also
other
witnesses
mahmat
banjer
and
a
good
many
others
underwent
a
close
examination
that
dragged
its
weary
length
far
into
the
evening
a
messenger
was
sent
for
abdulla
who
excused
himself
from
coming
on
the
score
of
his
venerable
age
but
sent
reshid
mahmat
had
to
produce
the
bangle
and
saw
with
rage
and
mortification
the
lieutenant
put
it
in
his
pocket
as
one
of
the
proofs
of
dain
'
s
death
to
be
sent
in
with
the
official
report
of
the
mission
babalatchi
'
s
ring
was
also
impounded
for
the
same
purpose
but
the
experienced
statesman
was
resigned
to
that
loss
from
the
very
beginning
he
did
not
mind
as
long
as
he
was
sure
that
the
white
men
believed
he
put
that
question
to
himself
earnestly
as
he
left
one
of
the
last
when
the
proceedings
came
to
a
close
he
was
not
certain
still
if
they
believed
only
for
a
night
he
would
put
dain
beyond
their
reach
and
feel
safe
himself
he
walked
away
fast
looking
from
time
to
time
over
his
shoulder
in
the
fear
of
being
followed
but
he
saw
and
heard
nothing
ten
o
'
clock
said
the
lieutenant
looking
at
his
watch
and
yawning
i
shall
hear
some
of
the
captain
'
s
complimentary
remarks
when
we
get
back
miserable
business
this
do
you
think
all
this
is
true
asked
the
younger
man
true
it
is
just
possible
but
if
it
is
not
true
what
can
we
do
if
we
had
a
dozen
boats
we
could
patrol
the
creeks
and
that
would
not
be
much
good
that
drunken
madman
was
right
we
have
not
enough
hold
on
this
coast
they
do
what
they
like
are
our
hammocks
slung
yes
i
told
the
coxswain
strange
couple
over
there
said
the
sub
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
towards
almayer
'
s
house
hem
queer
certainly
what
have
you
been
telling
her
i
was
attending
to
the
father
most
of
the
time
i
assure
you
i
have
been
perfectly
civil
protested
the
other
warmly
all
right
do
not
get
excited
she
objects
to
civility
then
from
what
i
understand
i
thought
you
might
have
been
tender
you
know
we
are
on
service
well
of
course
never
forget
that
coldly
civil
that
'
s
all
they
both
laughed
a
little
and
not
feeling
sleepy
began
to
pace
the
verandah
side
by
side
the
moon
rose
stealthily
above
the
trees
and
suddenly
changed
the
river
into
a
stream
of
scintillating
silver
the
forest
came
out
of
the
black
void
and
stood
sombre
and
pensive
over
the
sparkling
water
the
breeze
died
away
into
a
breathless
calm
seamanlike
the
two
officers
tramped
measuredly
up
and
down
without
exchanging
a
word
the
loose
planks
rattled
rhythmically
under
their
steps
with
obstrusive
dry
sound
in
the
perfect
silence
of
the
night
as
they
were
wheeling
round
again
the
younger
man
stood
attentive
did
you
hear
that
he
asked
no
said
the
other
hear
what
i
thought
i
heard
a
cry
ever
so
faint
seemed
a
woman
'
s
voice
in
that
other
house
ah
again
hear
it
no
said
the
lieutenant
after
listening
awhile
you
young
fellows
always
hear
women
'
s
voices
if
you
are
going
to
dream
you
had
better
get
into
your
hammock
good
-
night
the
moon
mounted
higher
and
the
warm
shadows
grew
smaller
and
crept
away
as
if
hiding
before
the
cold
and
cruel
light
it
has
set
at
last
said
nina
to
her
mother
pointing
towards
the
hills
behind
which
the
sun
had
sunk
listen
mother
i
am
going
now
to
bulangi
'
s
creek
and
if
i
should
never
return
she
interrupted
herself
and
something
like
doubt
dimmed
for
a
moment
the
fire
of
suppressed
exaltation
that
had
glowed
in
her
eyes
and
had
illuminated
the
serene
impassiveness
of
her
features
with
a
ray
of
eager
life
during
all
that
long
day
of
excitement
the
day
of
joy
and
anxiety
of
hope
and
terror
of
vague
grief
and
indistinct
delight
while
the
sun
shone
with
that
dazzling
light
in
which
her
love
was
born
and
grew
till
it
possessed
her
whole
being
she
was
kept
firm
in
her
unwavering
resolve
by
the
mysterious
whisperings
of
desire
which
filled
her
heart
with
impatient
longing
for
the
darkness
that
would
mean
the
end
of
danger
and
strife
the
beginning
of
happiness
the
fulfilling
of
love
the
completeness
of
life
it
had
set
at
last
the
short
tropical
twilight
went
out
before
she
could
draw
the
long
breath
of
relief
and
now
the
sudden
darkness
seemed
to
be
full
of
menacing
voices
calling
upon
her
to
rush
headlong
into
the
unknown
to
be
true
to
her
own
impulses
to
give
herself
up
to
the
passion
she
had
evoked
and
shared
he
was
waiting
in
the
solitude
of
the
secluded
clearing
in
the
vast
silence
of
the
forest
he
was
waiting
alone
a
fugitive
in
fear
of
his
life
indifferent
to
his
danger
he
was
waiting
for
her
it
was
for
her
only
that
he
had
come
and
now
as
the
time
approached
when
he
should
have
his
reward
she
asked
herself
with
dismay
what
meant
that
chilling
doubt
of
her
own
will
and
of
her
own
desire
with
an
effort
she
shook
off
the
fear
of
the
passing
weakness
he
should
have
his
reward
her
woman
'
s
love
and
her
woman
'
s
honour
overcame
the
faltering
distrust
of
that
unknown
future
waiting
for
her
in
the
darkness
of
the
river
no
you
will
not
return
muttered
mrs
almayer
prophetically
without
you
he
will
not
go
and
if
he
remains
here
she
waved
her
hand
towards
the
lights
of
almayer
'
s
folly
and
the
unfinished
sentence
died
out
in
a
threatening
murmur
the
two
women
had
met
behind
the
house
and
now
were
walking
slowly
together
towards
the
creek
where
all
the
canoes
were
moored
arrived
at
the
fringe
of
bushes
they
stopped
by
a
common
impulse
and
mrs
almayer
laying
her
hand
on
her
daughter
'
s
arm
tried
in
vain
to
look
close
into
the
girl
'
s
averted
face
when
she
attempted
to
speak
her
first
words
were
lost
in
a
stifled
sob
that
sounded
strangely
coming
from
that
woman
who
of
all
human
passions
seemed
to
know
only
those
of
anger
and
hate
you
are
going
away
to
be
a
great
ranee
she
said
at
last
in
a
voice
that
was
steady
enough
now
and
if
you
be
wise
you
shall
have
much
power
that
will
endure
many
days
and
even
last
into
your
old
age
what
have
i
been
a
slave
all
my
life
and
i
have
cooked
rice
for
a
man
who
had
no
courage
and
no
wisdom
hai
i
even
i
was
given
in
gift
by
a
chief
and
a
warrior
to
a
man
that
was
neither
hai
hai
she
wailed
to
herself
softly
lamenting
the
lost
possibilities
of
murder
and
mischief
that
could
have
fallen
to
her
lot
had
she
been
mated
with
a
congenial
spirit
nina
bent
down
over
mrs
almayer
'
s
slight
form
and
scanned
attentively
under
the
stars
that
had
rushed
out
on
the
black
sky
and
now
hung
breathless
over
that
strange
parting
her
mother
'
s
shrivelled
features
and
looked
close
into
the
sunken
eyes
that
could
see
into
her
own
dark
future
by
the
light
of
a
long
and
a
painful
experience
again
she
felt
herself
fascinated
as
of
old
by
her
mother
'
s
exalted
mood
and
by
the
oracular
certainty
of
expression
which
together
with
her
fits
of
violence
had
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
reputation
for
witchcraft
she
enjoyed
in
the
settlement
i
was
a
slave
and
you
shall
be
a
queen
went
on
mrs
almayer
looking
straight
before
her
but
remember
men
'
s
strength
and
their
weakness
tremble
before
his
anger
so
that
he
may
see
your
fear
in
the
light
of
day
but
in
your
heart
you
may
laugh
for
after
sunset
he
is
your
slave
a
slave
he
the
master
of
life
you
do
not
know
him
mother
mrs
almayer
condescended
to
laugh
contemptuously
you
speak
like
a
fool
of
a
white
woman
she
exclaimed
what
do
you
know
of
men
'
s
anger
and
of
men
'
s
love
have
you
watched
the
sleep
of
men
weary
of
dealing
death
have
you
felt
about
you
the
strong
arm
that
could
drive
a
kriss
deep
into
a
beating
heart
yah
you
are
a
white
woman
and
ought
to
pray
to
a
woman
-
god
why
do
you
say
this
i
have
listened
to
your
words
so
long
that
i
have
forgotten
my
old
life
if
i
was
white
would
i
stand
here
ready
to
go
mother
i
shall
return
to
the
house
and
look
once
more
at
my
father
'
s
face
no
said
mrs
almayer
violently
no
he
sleeps
now
the
sleep
of
gin
and
if
you
went
back
he
might
awake
and
see
you
no
he
shall
never
see
you
when
the
terrible
old
man
took
you
away
from
me
when
you
were
little
you
remember
it
was
such
a
long
time
ago
murmured
nina
i
remember
went
on
mrs
almayer
fiercely
i
wanted
to
look
at
your
face
again
he
said
no
i
heard
you
cry
and
jumped
into
the
river
you
were
his
daughter
then
you
are
my
daughter
now
never
shall
you
go
back
to
that
house
you
shall
never
cross
this
courtyard
again
no
no
her
voice
rose
almost
to
a
shout
on
the
other
side
of
the
creek
there
was
a
rustle
in
the
long
grass
the
two
women
heard
it
and
listened
for
a
while
in
startled
silence
i
shall
go
said
nina
in
a
cautious
but
intense
whisper
what
is
your
hate
or
your
revenge
to
me
she
moved
towards
the
house
mrs
almayer
clinging
to
her
and
trying
to
pull
her
back
stop
you
shall
not
go
she
gasped
nina
pushed
away
her
mother
impatiently
and
gathered
up
her
skirts
for
a
quick
run
but
mrs
almayer
ran
forward
and
turned
round
facing
her
daughter
with
outstretched
arms
if
you
move
another
step
she
exclaimed
breathing
quickly
i
shall
cry
out
do
you
see
those
lights
in
the
big
house
there
sit
two
white
men
angry
because
they
cannot
have
the
blood
of
the
man
you
love
and
in
those
dark
houses
she
continued
more
calmly
as
she
pointed
towards
the
settlement
my
voice
could
wake
up
men
that
would
lead
the
orang
blanda
soldiers
to
him
who
is
waiting
for
you
she
could
not
see
her
daughter
'
s
face
but
the
white
figure
before
her
stood
silent
and
irresolute
in
the
darkness
mrs
almayer
pursued
her
advantage
give
up
your
old
life
forget
she
said
in
entreating
tones
forget
that
you
ever
looked
at
a
white
face
forget
their
words
forget
their
thoughts
they
speak
lies
and
they
think
lies
because
they
despise
us
that
are
better
than
they
are
but
not
so
strong
forget
their
friendship
and
their
contempt
forget
their
many
gods
girl
why
do
you
want
to
remember
the
past
when
there
is
a
warrior
and
a
chief
ready
to
give
many
lives
his
own
life
for
one
of
your
smiles
while
she
spoke
she
pushed
gently
her
daughter
towards
the
canoes
hiding
her
own
fear
anxiety
and
doubt
under
the
flood
of
passionate
words
that
left
nina
no
time
to
think
and
no
opportunity
to
protest
even
if
she
had
wished
it
but
she
did
not
wish
it
now
at
the
bottom
of
that
passing
desire
to
look
again
at
her
father
'
s
face
there
was
no
strong
affection
she
felt
no
scruples
and
no
remorse
at
leaving
suddenly
that
man
whose
sentiment
towards
herself
she
could
not
understand
she
could
not
even
see
there
was
only
an
instinctive
clinging
to
old
life
to
old
habits
to
old
faces
that
fear
of
finality
which
lurks
in
every
human
breast
and
prevents
so
many
heroisms
and
so
many
crimes
for
years
she
had
stood
between
her
mother
and
her
father
the
one
so
strong
in
her
weakness
the
other
so
weak
where
he
could
have
been
strong
between
those
two
beings
so
dissimilar
so
antagonistic
she
stood
with
mute
heart
wondering
and
angry
at
the
fact
of
her
own
existence
it
seemed
so
unreasonable
so
humiliating
to
be
flung
there
in
that
settlement
and
to
see
the
days
rush
by
into
the
past
without
a
hope
a
desire
or
an
aim
that
would
justify
the
life
she
had
to
endure
in
ever
-
growing
weariness
she
had
little
belief
and
no
sympathy
for
her
father
'
s
dreams
but
the
savage
ravings
of
her
mother
chanced
to
strike
a
responsive
chord
deep
down
somewhere
in
her
despairing
heart
and
she
dreamed
dreams
of
her
own
with
the
persistent
absorption
of
a
captive
thinking
of
liberty
within
the
walls
of
his
prison
cell
with
the
coming
of
dain
she
found
the
road
to
freedom
by
obeying
the
voice
of
the
new
-
born
impulses
and
with
surprised
joy
she
thought
she
could
read
in
his
eyes
the
answer
to
all
the
questionings
of
her
heart
she
understood
now
the
reason
and
the
aim
of
life
and
in
the
triumphant
unveiling
of
that
mystery
she
threw
away
disdainfully
her
past
with
its
sad
thoughts
its
bitter
feelings
and
its
faint
affections
now
withered
and
dead
in
contact
with
her
fierce
passion
mrs
almayer
unmoored
nina
'
s
own
canoe
and
straightening
herself
painfully
stood
painter
in
hand
looking
at
her
daughter
quick
she
said
get
away
before
the
moon
rises
while
the
river
is
dark
i
am
afraid
of
abdulla
'
s
slaves
the
wretches
prowl
in
the
night
often
and
might
see
and
follow
you
there
are
two
paddles
in
the
canoe
nina
approached
her
mother
and
hesitatingly
touched
lightly
with
her
lips
the
wrinkled
forehead
mrs
almayer
snorted
contemptuously
in
protest
against
that
tenderness
which
she
nevertheless
feared
could
be
contagious
shall
i
ever
see
you
again
mother
murmured
nina
no
said
mrs
almayer
after
a
short
silence
why
should
you
return
here
where
it
is
my
fate
to
die
you
will
live
far
away
in
splendour
and
might
when
i
hear
of
white
men
driven
from
the
islands
then
i
shall
know
that
you
are
alive
and
that
you
remember
my
words
i
shall
always
remember
returned
nina
earnestly
but
where
is
my
power
and
what
can
i
do
do
not
let
him
look
too
long
in
your
eyes
nor
lay
his
head
on
your
knees
without
reminding
him
that
men
should
fight
before
they
rest
and
if
he
lingers
give
him
his
kriss
yourself
and
bid
him
go
as
the
wife
of
a
mighty
prince
should
do
when
the
enemies
are
near
let
him
slay
the
white
men
that
come
to
us
to
trade
with
prayers
on
their
lips
and
loaded
guns
in
their
hands
ah
she
ended
with
a
sigh
they
are
on
every
sea
and
on
every
shore
and
they
are
very
many
she
swung
the
bow
of
the
canoe
towards
the
river
but
did
not
let
go
the
gunwale
keeping
her
hand
on
it
in
irresolute
thoughtfulness
nina
put
the
point
of
the
paddle
against
the
bank
ready
to
shove
off
into
the
stream
what
is
it
mother
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
do
you
hear
anything
no
said
mrs
almayer
absently
listen
nina
she
continued
abruptly
after
a
slight
pause
in
after
years
there
will
be
other
women
a
stifled
cry
in
the
boat
interrupted
her
and
the
paddle
rattled
in
the
canoe
as
it
slipped
from
nina
'
s
hands
which
she
put
out
in
a
protesting
gesture
mrs
almayer
fell
on
her
knees
on
the
bank
and
leaned
over
the
gunwale
so
as
to
bring
her
own
face
close
to
her
daughter
'
s
there
will
be
other
women
she
repeated
firmly
i
tell
you
that
because
you
are
half
white
and
may
forget
that
he
is
a
great
chief
and
that
such
things
must
be
hide
your
anger
and
do
not
let
him
see
on
your
face
the
pain
that
will
eat
your
heart
meet
him
with
joy
in
your
eyes
and
wisdom
on
your
lips
for
to
you
he
will
turn
in
sadness
or
in
doubt
as
long
as
he
looks
upon
many
women
your
power
will
last
but
should
there
be
one
one
only
with
whom
he
seems
to
forget
you
then
i
could
not
live
exclaimed
nina
covering
her
face
with
both
her
hands
do
not
speak
so
mother
it
could
not
be
then
went
on
mrs
almayer
steadily
to
that
woman
nina
show
no
mercy
she
moved
the
canoe
down
towards
the
stream
by
the
gunwale
and
gripped
it
with
both
her
hands
the
bow
pointing
into
the
river
are
you
crying
she
asked
sternly
of
her
daughter
who
sat
still
with
covered
face
arise
and
take
your
paddle
for
he
has
waited
long
enough
and
remember
nina
no
mercy
and
if
you
must
strike
strike
with
a
steady
hand
she
put
out
all
her
strength
and
swinging
her
body
over
the
water
shot
the
light
craft
far
into
the
stream
when
she
recovered
herself
from
the
effort
she
tried
vainly
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
canoe
that
seemed
to
have
dissolved
suddenly
into
the
white
mist
trailing
over
the
heated
waters
of
the
pantai
after
listening
for
a
while
intently
on
her
knees
mrs
almayer
rose
with
a
deep
sigh
while
two
tears
wandered
slowly
down
her
withered
cheeks
she
wiped
them
off
quickly
with
a
wisp
of
her
grey
hair
as
if
ashamed
of
herself
but
could
not
stifle
another
loud
sigh
for
her
heart
was
heavy
and
she
suffered
much
being
unused
to
tender
emotions
this
time
she
fancied
she
had
heard
a
faint
noise
like
the
echo
of
her
own
sigh
and
she
stopped
straining
her
ears
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
and
peering
apprehensively
towards
the
bushes
near
her
who
is
there
she
asked
in
an
unsteady
voice
while
her
imagination
peopled
the
solitude
of
the
riverside
with
ghost
-
like
forms
who
is
there
she
repeated
faintly
there
was
no
answer
only
the
voice
of
the
river
murmuring
in
sad
monotone
behind
the
white
veil
seemed
to
swell
louder
for
a
moment
to
die
away
again
in
a
soft
whisper
of
eddies
washing
against
the
bank
mrs
almayer
shook
her
head
as
if
in
answer
to
her
own
thoughts
and
walked
quickly
away
from
the
bushes
looking
to
the
right
and
left
watchfully
she
went
straight
towards
the
cooking
-
shed
observing
that
the
embers
of
the
fire
there
glowed
more
brightly
than
usual
as
if
somebody
had
been
adding
fresh
fuel
to
the
fires
during
the
evening
as
she
approached
babalatchi
who
had
been
squatting
in
the
warm
glow
rose
and
met
her
in
the
shadow
outside
is
she
gone
asked
the
anxious
statesman
hastily
yes
answered
mrs
almayer
what
are
the
white
men
doing
when
did
you
leave
them
they
are
sleeping
now
i
think
may
they
never
wake
exclaimed
babalatchi
fervently
oh
but
they
are
devils
and
made
much
talk
and
trouble
over
that
carcase
the
chief
threatened
me
twice
with
his
hand
and
said
he
would
have
me
tied
up
to
a
tree
tie
me
up
to
a
tree
me
he
repeated
striking
his
breast
violently
mrs
almayer
laughed
tauntingly
and
you
salaamed
and
asked
for
mercy
men
with
arms
by
their
side
acted
otherwise
when
i
was
young
and
where
are
they
the
men
of
your
youth
you
mad
woman
retorted
babalatchi
angrily
killed
by
the
dutch
aha
but
i
shall
live
to
deceive
them
a
man
knows
when
to
fight
and
when
to
tell
peaceful
lies
you
would
know
that
if
you
were
not
a
woman
but
mrs
almayer
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
with
bent
body
and
outstretched
arm
she
appeared
to
be
listening
to
some
noise
behind
the
shed
there
are
strange
sounds
she
whispered
with
evident
alarm
i
have
heard
in
the
air
the
sounds
of
grief
as
of
a
sigh
and
weeping
that
was
by
the
riverside
and
now
again
i
heard
where
asked
babalatchi
in
an
altered
voice
what
did
you
hear
close
here
it
was
like
a
breath
long
drawn
i
wish
i
had
burnt
the
paper
over
the
body
before
it
was
buried
yes
assented
babalatchi
but
the
white
men
had
him
thrown
into
a
hole
at
once
you
know
he
found
his
death
on
the
river
he
added
cheerfully
and
his
ghost
may
hail
the
canoes
but
would
leave
the
land
alone
mrs
almayer
who
had
been
craning
her
neck
to
look
round
the
corner
of
the
shed
drew
back
her
head
there
is
nobody
there
she
said
reassured
is
it
not
time
for
the
rajah
war
-
canoe
to
go
to
the
clearing
i
have
been
waiting
for
it
here
for
i
myself
must
go
explained
babalatchi
i
think
i
will
go
over
and
see
what
makes
them
late
when
will
you
come
the
rajah
gives
you
refuge
i
shall
paddle
over
before
the
break
of
day
i
cannot
leave
my
dollars
behind
muttered
mrs
almayer
they
separated
babalatchi
crossed
the
courtyard
towards
the
creek
to
get
his
canoe
and
mrs
almayer
walked
slowly
to
the
house
ascended
the
plankway
and
passing
through
the
back
verandah
entered
the
passage
leading
to
the
front
of
the
house
but
before
going
in
she
turned
in
the
doorway
and
looked
back
at
the
empty
and
silent
courtyard
now
lit
up
by
the
rays
of
the
rising
moon
no
sooner
she
had
disappeared
however
than
a
vague
shape
flitted
out
from
amongst
the
stalks
of
the
banana
plantation
darted
over
the
moonlit
space
and
fell
in
the
darkness
at
the
foot
of
the
verandah
it
might
have
been
the
shadow
of
a
driving
cloud
so
noiseless
and
rapid
was
its
passage
but
for
the
trail
of
disturbed
grass
whose
feathery
heads
trembled
and
swayed
for
a
long
time
in
the
moonlight
before
they
rested
motionless
and
gleaming
like
a
design
of
silver
sprays
embroidered
on
a
sombre
background
mrs
almayer
lighted
the
cocoanut
lamp
and
lifting
cautiously
the
red
curtain
gazed
upon
her
husband
shading
the
light
with
her
hand
almayer
huddled
up
in
the
chair
one
of
his
arms
hanging
down
the
other
thrown
across
the
lower
part
of
his
face
as
if
to
ward
off
an
invisible
enemy
his
legs
stretched
straight
out
slept
heavily
unconscious
of
the
unfriendly
eyes
that
looked
upon
him
in
disparaging
criticism
at
his
feet
lay
the
overturned
table
amongst
a
wreck
of
crockery
and
broken
bottles
the
appearance
as
of
traces
left
by
a
desperate
struggle
was
accentuated
by
the
chairs
which
seemed
to
have
been
scattered
violently
all
over
the
place
and
now
lay
about
the
verandah
with
a
lamentable
aspect
of
inebriety
in
their
helpless
attitudes
only
nina
'
s
big
rocking
-
chair
standing
black
and
motionless
on
its
high
runners
towered
above
the
chaos
of
demoralised
furniture
unflinchingly
dignified
and
patient
waiting
for
its
burden
with
a
last
scornful
look
towards
the
sleeper
mrs
almayer
passed
behind
the
curtain
into
her
own
room
a
couple
of
bats
encouraged
by
the
darkness
and
the
peaceful
state
of
affairs
resumed
their
silent
and
oblique
gambols
above
almayer
'
s
head
and
for
a
long
time
the
profound
quiet
of
the
house
was
unbroken
save
for
the
deep
breathing
of
the
sleeping
man
and
the
faint
tinkle
of
silver
in
the
hands
of
the
woman
preparing
for
flight
in
the
increasing
light
of
the
moon
that
had
risen
now
above
the
night
mist
the
objects
on
the
verandah
came
out
strongly
outlined
in
black
splashes
of
shadow
with
all
the
uncompromising
ugliness
of
their
disorder
and
a
caricature
of
the
sleeping
almayer
appeared
on
the
dirty
whitewash
of
the
wall
behind
him
in
a
grotesquely
exaggerated
detail
of
attitude
and
feature
enlarged
to
a
heroic
size
the
discontented
bats
departed
in
quest
of
darker
places
and
a
lizard
came
out
in
short
nervous
rushes
and
pleased
with
the
white
table
-
cloth
stopped
on
it
in
breathless
immobility
that
would
have
suggested
sudden
death
had
it
not
been
for
the
melodious
call
he
exchanged
with
a
less
adventurous
friend
hiding
amongst
the
lumber
in
the
courtyard
then
the
boards
in
the
passage
creaked
the
lizard
vanished
and
almayer
stirred
uneasily
with
a
sigh
slowly
out
of
the
senseless
annihilation
of
drunken
sleep
he
was
returning
through
the
land
of
dreams
to
waking
consciousness
almayer
'
s
head
rolled
from
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
the
oppression
of
his
dream
the
heavens
had
descended
upon
him
like
a
heavy
mantle
and
trailed
in
starred
folds
far
under
him
stars
above
stars
all
round
him
and
from
the
stars
under
his
feet
rose
a
whisper
full
of
entreaties
and
tears
and
sorrowful
faces
flitted
amongst
the
clusters
of
light
filling
the
infinite
space
below
how
escape
from
the
importunity
of
lamentable
cries
and
from
the
look
of
staring
sad
eyes
in
the
faces
which
pressed
round
him
till
he
gasped
for
breath
under
the
crushing
weight
of
worlds
that
hung
over
his
aching
shoulders
get
away
but
how
if
he
attempted
to
move
he
would
step
off
into
nothing
and
perish
in
the
crashing
fall
of
that
universe
of
which
he
was
the
only
support
and
what
were
the
voices
saying
urging
him
to
move
why
move
to
destruction
not
likely
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
filled
him
with
indignation
he
got
a
firmer
foothold
and
stiffened
his
muscles
in
heroic
resolve
to
carry
his
burden
to
all
eternity
and
ages
passed
in
the
superhuman
labour
amidst
the
rush
of
circling
worlds
in
the
plaintive
murmur
of
sorrowful
voices
urging
him
to
desist
before
it
was
too
late
till
the
mysterious
power
that
had
laid
upon
him
the
giant
task
seemed
at
last
to
seek
his
destruction
with
terror
he
felt
an
irresistible
hand
shaking
him
by
the
shoulder
while
the
chorus
of
voices
swelled
louder
into
an
agonised
prayer
to
go
go
before
it
is
too
late
he
felt
himself
slipping
losing
his
balance
as
something
dragged
at
his
legs
and
he
fell
with
a
faint
cry
he
glided
out
of
the
anguish
of
perishing
creation
into
an
imperfect
waking
that
seemed
to
be
still
under
the
spell
of
his
dream
what
what
he
murmured
sleepily
without
moving
or
opening
his
eyes
his
head
still
felt
heavy
and
he
had
not
the
courage
to
raise
his
eyelids
in
his
ears
there
still
lingered
the
sound
of
entreating
whisper
am
i
awake
why
do
i
hear
the
voices
he
argued
to
himself
hazily
i
cannot
get
rid
of
the
horrible
nightmare
yet
i
have
been
very
drunk
what
is
that
shaking
me
i
am
dreaming
yet
i
must
open
my
eyes
and
be
done
with
it
i
am
only
half
awake
it
is
evident
he
made
an
effort
to
shake
off
his
stupor
and
saw
a
face
close
to
his
glaring
at
him
with
staring
eyeballs
he
closed
his
eyes
again
in
amazed
horror
and
sat
up
straight
in
the
chair
trembling
in
every
limb
what
was
this
apparition
his
own
fancy
no
doubt
his
nerves
had
been
much
tried
the
day
before
and
then
the
drink
he
would
not
see
it
again
if
he
had
the
courage
to
look
he
would
look
directly
get
a
little
steadier
first
so
now
he
looked
the
figure
of
a
woman
standing
in
the
steely
light
her
hands
stretched
forth
in
a
suppliant
gesture
confronted
him
from
the
far
-
off
end
of
the
verandah
and
in
the
space
between
him
and
the
obstinate
phantom
floated
the
murmur
of
words
that
fell
on
his
ears
in
a
jumble
of
torturing
sentences
the
meaning
of
which
escaped
the
utmost
efforts
of
his
brain
who
spoke
the
malay
words
who
ran
away
why
too
late
and
too
late
for
what
what
meant
those
words
of
hate
and
love
mixed
so
strangely
together
the
ever
-
recurring
names
falling
on
his
ears
again
and
again
nina
dain
dain
nina
dain
was
dead
and
nina
was
sleeping
unaware
of
the
terrible
experience
through
which
he
was
now
passing
was
he
going
to
be
tormented
for
ever
sleeping
or
waking
and
have
no
peace
either
night
or
day
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
he
shouted
the
last
words
aloud
the
shadowy
woman
seemed
to
shrink
and
recede
a
little
from
him
towards
the
doorway
and
there
was
a
shriek
exasperated
by
the
incomprehensible
nature
of
his
torment
almayer
made
a
rush
upon
the
apparition
which
eluded
his
grasp
and
he
brought
up
heavily
against
the
wall
quick
as
lightning
he
turned
round
and
pursued
fiercely
the
mysterious
figure
fleeing
from
him
with
piercing
shrieks
that
were
like
fuel
to
the
flames
of
his
anger
over
the
furniture
round
the
overturned
table
and
now
he
had
it
cornered
behind
nina
'
s
chair
to
the
left
to
the
right
they
dodged
the
chair
rocking
madly
