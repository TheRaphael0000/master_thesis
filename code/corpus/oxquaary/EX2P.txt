mr
beebe
was
right
lucy
never
knew
her
desires
so
clearly
as
after
music
she
had
not
really
appreciated
the
clergyman
'
s
wit
nor
the
suggestive
twitterings
of
miss
alan
conversation
was
tedious
she
wanted
something
big
and
she
believed
that
it
would
have
come
to
her
on
the
wind
-
swept
platform
of
an
electric
tram
this
she
might
not
attempt
it
was
unladylike
why
why
were
most
big
things
unladylike
charlotte
had
once
explained
to
her
why
it
was
not
that
ladies
were
inferior
to
men
it
was
that
they
were
different
their
mission
was
to
inspire
others
to
achievement
rather
than
to
achieve
themselves
indirectly
by
means
of
tact
and
a
spotless
name
a
lady
could
accomplish
much
but
if
she
rushed
into
the
fray
herself
she
would
be
first
censured
then
despised
and
finally
ignored
poems
had
been
written
to
illustrate
this
point
there
is
much
that
is
immortal
in
this
medieval
lady
the
dragons
have
gone
and
so
have
the
knights
but
still
she
lingers
in
our
midst
she
reigned
in
many
an
early
victorian
castle
and
was
queen
of
much
early
victorian
song
it
is
sweet
to
protect
her
in
the
intervals
of
business
sweet
to
pay
her
honour
when
she
has
cooked
our
dinner
well
but
alas
the
creature
grows
degenerate
in
her
heart
also
there
are
springing
up
strange
desires
she
too
is
enamoured
of
heavy
winds
and
vast
panoramas
and
green
expanses
of
the
sea
she
has
marked
the
kingdom
of
this
world
how
full
it
is
of
wealth
and
beauty
and
war
a
radiant
crust
built
around
the
central
fires
spinning
towards
the
receding
heavens
men
declaring
that
she
inspires
them
to
it
move
joyfully
over
the
surface
having
the
most
delightful
meetings
with
other
men
happy
not
because
they
are
masculine
but
because
they
are
alive
before
the
show
breaks
up
she
would
like
to
drop
the
august
title
of
the
eternal
woman
and
go
there
as
her
transitory
self
lucy
does
not
stand
for
the
medieval
lady
who
was
rather
an
ideal
to
which
she
was
bidden
to
lift
her
eyes
when
feeling
serious
nor
has
she
any
system
of
revolt
here
and
there
a
restriction
annoyed
her
particularly
and
she
would
transgress
it
and
perhaps
be
sorry
that
she
had
done
so
this
afternoon
she
was
peculiarly
restive
she
would
really
like
to
do
something
of
which
her
well
-
wishers
disapproved
as
she
might
not
go
on
the
electric
tram
she
went
to
alinari
'
s
shop
there
she
bought
a
photograph
of
botticelli
'
s
birth
of
venus
venus
being
a
pity
spoilt
the
picture
otherwise
so
charming
and
miss
bartlett
had
persuaded
her
to
do
without
it
(
a
pity
in
art
of
course
signified
the
nude
)
giorgione
'
s
tempesta
the
idolino
some
of
the
sistine
frescoes
and
the
apoxyomenos
were
added
to
it
she
felt
a
little
calmer
then
and
bought
fra
angelico
'
s
coronation
giotto
'
s
ascension
of
st
john
some
della
robbia
babies
and
some
guido
reni
madonnas
for
her
taste
was
catholic
and
she
extended
uncritical
approval
to
every
well
-
known
name
but
though
she
spent
nearly
seven
lire
the
gates
of
liberty
seemed
still
unopened
she
was
conscious
of
her
discontent
it
was
new
to
her
to
be
conscious
of
it
the
world
she
thought
is
certainly
full
of
beautiful
things
if
only
i
could
come
across
them
it
was
not
surprising
that
mrs
honeychurch
disapproved
of
music
declaring
that
it
always
left
her
daughter
peevish
unpractical
and
touchy
nothing
ever
happens
to
me
she
reflected
as
she
entered
the
piazza
signoria
and
looked
nonchalantly
at
its
marvels
now
fairly
familiar
to
her
the
great
square
was
in
shadow
the
sunshine
had
come
too
late
to
strike
it
neptune
was
already
unsubstantial
in
the
twilight
half
god
half
ghost
and
his
fountain
plashed
dreamily
to
the
men
and
satyrs
who
idled
together
on
its
marge
the
loggia
showed
as
the
triple
entrance
of
a
cave
wherein
many
a
deity
shadowy
but
immortal
looking
forth
upon
the
arrivals
and
departures
of
mankind
it
was
the
hour
of
unreality
the
hour
that
is
when
unfamiliar
things
are
real
an
older
person
at
such
an
hour
and
in
such
a
place
might
think
that
sufficient
was
happening
to
him
and
rest
content
lucy
desired
more
she
fixed
her
eyes
wistfully
on
the
tower
of
the
palace
which
rose
out
of
the
lower
darkness
like
a
pillar
of
roughened
gold
it
seemed
no
longer
a
tower
no
longer
supported
by
earth
but
some
unattainable
treasure
throbbing
in
the
tranquil
sky
its
brightness
mesmerized
her
still
dancing
before
her
eyes
when
she
bent
them
to
the
ground
and
started
towards
home
then
something
did
happen
two
italians
by
the
loggia
had
been
bickering
about
a
debt
cinque
lire
they
had
cried
cinque
lire
they
sparred
at
each
other
and
one
of
them
was
hit
lightly
upon
the
chest
he
frowned
he
bent
towards
lucy
with
a
look
of
interest
as
if
he
had
an
important
message
for
her
he
opened
his
lips
to
deliver
it
and
a
stream
of
red
came
out
between
them
and
trickled
down
his
unshaven
chin
that
was
all
a
crowd
rose
out
of
the
dusk
it
hid
this
extraordinary
man
from
her
and
bore
him
away
to
the
fountain
mr
george
emerson
happened
to
be
a
few
paces
away
looking
at
her
across
the
spot
where
the
man
had
been
how
very
odd
across
something
even
as
she
caught
sight
of
him
he
grew
dim
the
palace
itself
grew
dim
swayed
above
her
fell
on
to
her
softly
slowly
noiselessly
and
the
sky
fell
with
it
she
thought
oh
what
have
i
done
oh
what
have
i
done
she
murmured
and
opened
her
eyes
george
emerson
still
looked
at
her
but
not
across
anything
she
had
complained
of
dullness
and
lo
one
man
was
stabbed
and
another
held
her
in
his
arms
they
were
sitting
on
some
steps
in
the
uffizi
arcade
he
must
have
carried
her
he
rose
when
she
spoke
and
began
to
dust
his
knees
she
repeated
oh
what
have
i
done
you
fainted
i
i
am
very
sorry
how
are
you
now
perfectly
well
absolutely
well
and
she
began
to
nod
and
smile
then
let
us
come
home
there
'
s
no
point
in
our
stopping
he
held
out
his
hand
to
pull
her
up
she
pretended
not
to
see
it
the
cries
from
the
fountain
they
had
never
ceased
rang
emptily
the
whole
world
seemed
pale
and
void
of
its
original
meaning
how
very
kind
you
have
been
i
might
have
hurt
myself
falling
but
now
i
am
well
i
can
go
alone
thank
you
his
hand
was
still
extended
oh
my
photographs
she
exclaimed
suddenly
what
photographs
i
bought
some
photographs
at
alinari
'
s
i
must
have
dropped
them
out
there
in
the
square
she
looked
at
him
cautiously
would
you
add
to
your
kindness
by
fetching
them
he
added
to
his
kindness
as
soon
as
he
had
turned
his
back
lucy
arose
with
the
running
of
a
maniac
and
stole
down
the
arcade
towards
the
arno
miss
honeychurch
she
stopped
with
her
hand
on
her
heart
you
sit
still
you
are
not
fit
to
go
home
alone
yes
i
am
thank
you
so
very
much
no
you
are
not
you
'
d
go
openly
if
you
were
but
i
had
rather
then
i
do
not
fetch
your
photographs
i
had
rather
be
alone
he
said
imperiously
the
man
is
dead
the
man
is
probably
dead
sit
down
till
you
are
rested
she
was
bewildered
and
obeyed
him
and
do
not
move
till
i
come
back
in
the
distance
she
saw
creatures
with
black
hoods
such
as
appear
in
dreams
the
palace
tower
had
lost
the
reflection
of
the
declining
day
and
joined
itself
to
earth
how
should
she
talk
to
mr
emerson
when
he
returned
from
the
shadowy
square
again
the
thought
occurred
to
her
oh
what
have
i
done
the
thought
that
she
as
well
as
the
dying
man
had
crossed
some
spiritual
boundary
he
returned
and
she
talked
of
the
murder
oddly
enough
it
was
an
easy
topic
she
spoke
of
the
italian
character
she
became
almost
garrulous
over
the
incident
that
had
made
her
faint
five
minutes
before
being
strong
physically
she
soon
overcame
the
horror
of
blood
she
rose
without
his
assistance
and
though
wings
seemed
to
flutter
inside
her
she
walked
firmly
enough
towards
the
arno
there
a
cabman
signalled
to
them
they
refused
him
and
the
murderer
tried
to
kiss
him
you
say
how
very
odd
italians
are
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
police
mr
beebe
was
saying
that
italians
know
everything
but
i
think
they
are
rather
childish
when
my
cousin
and
i
were
at
the
pitti
yesterday
what
was
that
he
had
thrown
something
into
the
stream
what
did
you
throw
in
things
i
did
not
want
he
said
crossly
mr
emerson
well
where
are
the
photographs
he
was
silent
i
believe
it
was
my
photographs
that
you
threw
away
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
he
cried
and
his
voice
was
that
of
an
anxious
boy
her
heart
warmed
towards
him
for
the
first
time
they
were
covered
with
blood
there
i
am
glad
i
'
ve
told
you
and
all
the
time
we
were
making
conversation
i
was
wondering
what
to
do
with
them
he
pointed
down
-
stream
they
'
ve
gone
the
river
swirled
under
the
bridge
i
did
mind
them
so
and
one
is
so
foolish
it
seemed
better
that
they
should
go
out
to
the
sea
i
do
not
know
i
may
just
mean
that
they
frightened
me
then
the
boy
verged
into
a
man
for
something
tremendous
has
happened
i
must
face
it
without
getting
muddled
it
is
not
exactly
that
a
man
has
died
something
warned
lucy
that
she
must
stop
him
it
has
happened
he
repeated
and
i
mean
to
find
out
what
it
is
mr
emerson
he
turned
towards
her
frowning
as
if
she
had
disturbed
him
in
some
abstract
quest
i
want
to
ask
you
something
before
we
go
in
they
were
close
to
their
pension
she
stopped
and
leant
her
elbows
against
the
parapet
of
the
embankment
he
did
likewise
there
is
at
times
a
magic
in
identity
of
position
it
is
one
of
the
things
that
have
suggested
to
us
eternal
comradeship
she
moved
her
elbows
before
saying
i
have
behaved
ridiculously
he
was
following
his
own
thoughts
i
was
never
so
much
ashamed
of
myself
in
my
life
i
cannot
think
what
came
over
me
i
nearly
fainted
myself
he
said
but
she
felt
that
her
attitude
repelled
him
well
i
owe
you
a
thousand
apologies
oh
all
right
and
this
is
the
real
point
you
know
how
silly
people
are
gossiping
ladies
especially
i
am
afraid
you
understand
what
i
mean
i
am
afraid
i
do
not
i
mean
would
you
not
mention
it
to
any
one
my
foolish
behaviour
your
behaviour
oh
yes
all
right
all
right
thank
you
so
much
and
would
you
she
could
not
carry
her
request
any
further
the
river
was
rushing
below
them
almost
black
in
the
advancing
night
he
had
thrown
her
photographs
into
it
and
then
he
had
told
her
the
reason
it
struck
her
that
it
was
hopeless
to
look
for
chivalry
in
such
a
man
he
would
do
her
no
harm
by
idle
gossip
he
was
trustworthy
intelligent
and
even
kind
he
might
even
have
a
high
opinion
of
her
but
he
lacked
chivalry
his
thoughts
like
his
behaviour
would
not
be
modified
by
awe
it
was
useless
to
say
to
him
and
would
you
and
hope
that
he
would
complete
the
sentence
for
himself
averting
his
eyes
from
her
nakedness
like
the
knight
in
that
beautiful
picture
she
had
been
in
his
arms
and
he
remembered
it
just
as
he
remembered
the
blood
on
the
photographs
that
she
had
bought
in
alinari
'
s
shop
it
was
not
exactly
that
a
man
had
died
something
had
happened
to
the
living
they
had
come
to
a
situation
where
character
tells
and
where
childhood
enters
upon
the
branching
paths
of
youth
well
thank
you
so
much
she
repeated
how
quickly
these
accidents
do
happen
and
then
one
returns
to
the
old
life
i
do
not
anxiety
moved
her
to
question
him
his
answer
was
puzzling
i
shall
probably
want
to
live
but
why
mr
emerson
what
do
you
mean
i
shall
want
to
live
i
say
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
parapet
she
contemplated
the
river
arno
whose
roar
was
suggesting
some
unexpected
melody
to
her
ears
it
was
a
family
saying
that
you
never
knew
which
way
charlotte
bartlett
would
turn
she
was
perfectly
pleasant
and
sensible
over
lucy
'
s
adventure
found
the
abridged
account
of
it
quite
adequate
and
paid
suitable
tribute
to
the
courtesy
of
mr
george
emerson
she
and
miss
lavish
had
had
an
adventure
also
they
had
been
stopped
at
the
dazio
coming
back
and
the
young
officials
there
who
seemed
impudent
and
desoeuvre
had
tried
to
search
their
reticules
for
provisions
it
might
have
been
most
unpleasant
fortunately
miss
lavish
was
a
match
for
any
one
for
good
or
for
evil
lucy
was
left
to
face
her
problem
alone
none
of
her
friends
had
seen
her
either
in
the
piazza
or
later
on
by
the
embankment
mr
beebe
indeed
noticing
her
startled
eyes
at
dinner
-
time
had
again
passed
to
himself
the
remark
of
too
much
beethoven
but
he
only
supposed
that
she
was
ready
for
an
adventure
not
that
she
had
encountered
it
this
solitude
oppressed
her
she
was
accustomed
to
have
her
thoughts
confirmed
by
others
or
at
all
events
contradicted
it
was
too
dreadful
not
to
know
whether
she
was
thinking
right
or
wrong
at
breakfast
next
morning
she
took
decisive
action
there
were
two
plans
between
which
she
had
to
choose
mr
beebe
was
walking
up
to
the
torre
del
gallo
with
the
emersons
and
some
american
ladies
would
miss
bartlett
and
miss
honeychurch
join
the
party
charlotte
declined
for
herself
she
had
been
there
in
the
rain
the
previous
afternoon
but
she
thought
it
an
admirable
idea
for
lucy
who
hated
shopping
changing
money
fetching
letters
and
other
irksome
duties
all
of
which
miss
bartlett
must
accomplish
this
morning
and
could
easily
accomplish
alone
no
charlotte
cried
the
girl
with
real
warmth
it
is
very
kind
of
mr
beebe
but
i
am
certainly
coming
with
you
i
had
much
rather
very
well
dear
said
miss
bartlett
with
a
faint
flush
of
pleasure
that
called
forth
a
deep
flush
of
shame
on
the
cheeks
of
lucy
how
abominably
she
behaved
to
charlotte
now
as
always
but
now
she
should
alter
all
morning
she
would
be
really
nice
to
her
she
slipped
her
arm
into
her
cousin
'
s
and
they
started
off
along
the
lung
'
arno
the
river
was
a
lion
that
morning
in
strength
voice
and
colour
miss
bartlett
insisted
on
leaning
over
the
parapet
to
look
at
it
she
then
made
her
usual
remark
which
was
how
i
do
wish
freddy
and
your
mother
could
see
this
too
lucy
fidgeted
it
was
tiresome
of
charlotte
to
have
stopped
exactly
where
she
did
look
lucia
oh
you
are
watching
for
the
torre
del
gallo
party
i
feared
you
would
repent
you
of
your
choice
serious
as
the
choice
had
been
lucy
did
not
repent
yesterday
had
been
a
muddle
queer
and
odd
the
kind
of
thing
one
could
not
write
down
easily
on
paper
but
she
had
a
feeling
that
charlotte
and
her
shopping
were
preferable
to
george
emerson
and
the
summit
of
the
torre
del
gallo
since
she
could
not
unravel
the
tangle
she
must
take
care
not
to
re
-
enter
it
she
could
protest
sincerely
against
miss
bartlett
'
s
insinuations
but
though
she
had
avoided
the
chief
actor
the
scenery
unfortunately
remained
charlotte
with
the
complacency
of
fate
led
her
from
the
river
to
the
piazza
signoria
she
could
not
have
believed
that
stones
a
loggia
a
fountain
a
palace
tower
would
have
such
significance
for
a
moment
she
understood
the
nature
of
ghosts
the
exact
site
of
the
murder
was
occupied
not
by
a
ghost
but
by
miss
lavish
who
had
the
morning
newspaper
in
her
hand
she
hailed
them
briskly
the
dreadful
catastrophe
of
the
previous
day
had
given
her
an
idea
which
she
thought
would
work
up
into
a
book
oh
let
me
congratulate
you
said
miss
bartlett
after
your
despair
of
yesterday
what
a
fortunate
thing
aha
miss
honeychurch
come
you
here
i
am
in
luck
now
you
are
to
tell
me
absolutely
everything
that
you
saw
from
the
beginning
lucy
poked
at
the
ground
with
her
parasol
but
perhaps
you
would
rather
not
i
am
sorry
if
you
could
manage
without
it
i
think
i
would
rather
not
the
elder
ladies
exchanged
glances
not
of
disapproval
it
is
suitable
that
a
girl
should
feel
deeply
it
is
i
who
am
sorry
said
miss
lavish
literary
hacks
are
shameless
creatures
i
believe
there
'
s
no
secret
of
the
human
heart
into
which
we
would
not
pry
she
marched
cheerfully
to
the
fountain
and
back
and
did
a
few
calculations
in
realism
then
she
said
that
she
had
been
in
the
piazza
since
eight
o
'
clock
collecting
material
a
good
deal
of
it
was
unsuitable
but
of
course
one
always
had
to
adapt
the
two
men
had
quarrelled
over
a
five
-
franc
note
for
the
five
-
franc
note
she
should
substitute
a
young
lady
which
would
raise
the
tone
of
the
tragedy
and
at
the
same
time
furnish
an
excellent
plot
what
is
the
heroine
'
s
name
asked
miss
bartlett
leonora
said
miss
lavish
her
own
name
was
eleanor
i
do
hope
she
is
nice
that
desideratum
would
not
be
omitted
and
what
is
the
plot
love
murder
abduction
revenge
was
the
plot
but
it
all
came
while
the
fountain
plashed
to
the
satyrs
in
the
morning
sun
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
for
boring
on
like
this
miss
lavish
concluded
it
is
so
tempting
to
talk
to
really
sympathetic
people
of
course
this
is
the
barest
outline
there
will
be
a
deal
of
local
colouring
descriptions
of
florence
and
the
neighbourhood
and
i
shall
also
introduce
some
humorous
characters
and
let
me
give
you
all
fair
warning
i
intend
to
be
unmerciful
to
the
british
tourist
oh
you
wicked
woman
cried
miss
bartlett
i
am
sure
you
are
thinking
of
the
emersons
miss
lavish
gave
a
machiavellian
smile
i
confess
that
in
italy
my
sympathies
are
not
with
my
own
countrymen
it
is
the
neglected
italians
who
attract
me
and
whose
lives
i
am
going
to
paint
so
far
as
i
can
for
i
repeat
and
i
insist
and
i
have
always
held
most
strongly
that
a
tragedy
such
as
yesterday
'
s
is
not
the
less
tragic
because
it
happened
in
humble
life
there
was
a
fitting
silence
when
miss
lavish
had
concluded
then
the
cousins
wished
success
to
her
labours
and
walked
slowly
away
across
the
square
she
is
my
idea
of
a
really
clever
woman
said
miss
bartlett
that
last
remark
struck
me
as
so
particularly
true
it
should
be
a
most
pathetic
novel
lucy
assented
at
present
her
great
aim
was
not
to
get
put
into
it
her
perceptions
this
morning
were
curiously
keen
and
she
believed
that
miss
lavish
had
her
on
trial
for
an
ingenue
she
is
emancipated
but
only
in
the
very
best
sense
of
the
word
continued
miss
bartlett
slowly
none
but
the
superficial
would
be
shocked
at
her
we
had
a
long
talk
yesterday
she
believes
in
justice
and
truth
and
human
interest
she
told
me
also
that
she
has
a
high
opinion
of
the
destiny
of
woman
mr
eager
why
how
nice
what
a
pleasant
surprise
ah
not
for
me
said
the
chaplain
blandly
for
i
have
been
watching
you
and
miss
honeychurch
for
quite
a
little
time
we
were
chatting
to
miss
lavish
his
brow
contracted
so
i
saw
were
you
indeed
andate
via
sono
occupato
the
last
remark
was
made
to
a
vender
of
panoramic
photographs
who
was
approaching
with
a
courteous
smile
i
am
about
to
venture
a
suggestion
would
you
and
miss
honeychurch
be
disposed
to
join
me
in
a
drive
some
day
this
week
a
drive
in
the
hills
we
might
go
up
by
fiesole
and
back
by
settignano
there
is
a
point
on
that
road
where
we
could
get
down
and
have
an
hour
'
s
ramble
on
the
hillside
the
view
thence
of
florence
is
most
beautiful
far
better
than
the
hackneyed
view
of
fiesole
it
is
the
view
that
alessio
baldovinetti
is
fond
of
introducing
into
his
pictures
that
man
had
a
decided
feeling
for
landscape
decidedly
but
who
looks
at
it
to
-
day
ah
the
world
is
too
much
for
us
miss
bartlett
had
not
heard
of
alessio
baldovinetti
but
she
knew
that
mr
eager
was
no
commonplace
chaplain
he
was
a
member
of
the
residential
colony
who
had
made
florence
their
home
he
knew
the
people
who
never
walked
about
with
baedekers
who
had
learnt
to
take
a
siesta
after
lunch
who
took
drives
the
pension
tourists
had
never
heard
of
and
saw
by
private
influence
galleries
which
were
closed
to
them
living
in
delicate
seclusion
some
in
furnished
flats
others
in
renaissance
villas
on
fiesole
'
s
slope
they
read
wrote
studied
and
exchanged
ideas
thus
attaining
to
that
intimate
knowledge
or
rather
perception
of
florence
which
is
denied
to
all
who
carry
in
their
pockets
the
coupons
of
cook
therefore
an
invitation
from
the
chaplain
was
something
to
be
proud
of
between
the
two
sections
of
his
flock
he
was
often
the
only
link
and
it
was
his
avowed
custom
to
select
those
of
his
migratory
sheep
who
seemed
worthy
and
give
them
a
few
hours
in
the
pastures
of
the
permanent
tea
at
a
renaissance
villa
nothing
had
been
said
about
it
yet
but
if
it
did
come
to
that
how
lucy
would
enjoy
it
a
few
days
ago
and
lucy
would
have
felt
the
same
but
the
joys
of
life
were
grouping
themselves
anew
a
drive
in
the
hills
with
mr
eager
and
miss
bartlett
even
if
culminating
in
a
residential
tea
-
party
was
no
longer
the
greatest
of
them
she
echoed
the
raptures
of
charlotte
somewhat
faintly
only
when
she
heard
that
mr
beebe
was
also
coming
did
her
thanks
become
more
sincere
so
we
shall
be
a
partie
carree
said
the
chaplain
in
these
days
of
toil
and
tumult
one
has
great
needs
of
the
country
and
its
message
of
purity
andate
via
andate
presto
presto
ah
the
town
beautiful
as
it
is
it
is
the
town
they
assented
this
very
square
so
i
am
told
witnessed
yesterday
the
most
sordid
of
tragedies
to
one
who
loves
the
florence
of
dante
and
savonarola
there
is
something
portentous
in
such
desecration
portentous
and
humiliating
humiliating
indeed
said
miss
bartlett
miss
honeychurch
happened
to
be
passing
through
as
it
happened
she
can
hardly
bear
to
speak
of
it
she
glanced
at
lucy
proudly
and
how
came
we
to
have
you
here
asked
the
chaplain
paternally
miss
bartlett
'
s
recent
liberalism
oozed
away
at
the
question
do
not
blame
her
please
mr
eager
the
fault
is
mine
i
left
her
unchaperoned
so
you
were
here
alone
miss
honeychurch
his
voice
suggested
sympathetic
reproof
but
at
the
same
time
indicated
that
a
few
harrowing
details
would
not
be
unacceptable
his
dark
handsome
face
drooped
mournfully
towards
her
to
catch
her
reply
practically
one
of
our
pension
acquaintances
kindly
brought
her
home
said
miss
bartlett
adroitly
concealing
the
sex
of
the
preserver
for
her
also
it
must
have
been
a
terrible
experience
i
trust
that
neither
of
you
was
at
all
that
it
was
not
in
your
immediate
proximity
of
the
many
things
lucy
was
noticing
to
-
day
not
the
least
remarkable
was
this
the
ghoulish
fashion
in
which
respectable
people
will
nibble
after
blood
george
emerson
had
kept
the
subject
strangely
pure
he
died
by
the
fountain
i
believe
was
her
reply
and
you
and
your
friend
were
over
at
the
loggia
that
must
have
saved
you
much
you
have
not
of
course
seen
the
disgraceful
illustrations
which
the
gutter
press
this
man
is
a
public
nuisance
he
knows
that
i
am
a
resident
perfectly
well
and
yet
he
goes
on
worrying
me
to
buy
his
vulgar
views
surely
the
vendor
of
photographs
was
in
league
with
lucy
in
the
eternal
league
of
italy
with
youth
he
had
suddenly
extended
his
book
before
miss
bartlett
and
mr
eager
binding
their
hands
together
by
a
long
glossy
ribbon
of
churches
pictures
and
views
this
is
too
much
cried
the
chaplain
striking
petulantly
at
one
of
fra
angelico
'
s
angels
she
tore
a
shrill
cry
rose
from
the
vendor
the
book
it
seemed
was
more
valuable
than
one
would
have
supposed
willingly
would
i
purchase
began
miss
bartlett
ignore
him
said
mr
eager
sharply
and
they
all
walked
rapidly
away
from
the
square
but
an
italian
can
never
be
ignored
least
of
all
when
he
has
a
grievance
his
mysterious
persecution
of
mr
eager
became
relentless
the
air
rang
with
his
threats
and
lamentations
he
appealed
to
lucy
would
not
she
intercede
he
was
poor
he
sheltered
a
family
the
tax
on
bread
he
waited
he
gibbered
he
was
recompensed
he
was
dissatisfied
he
did
not
leave
them
until
he
had
swept
their
minds
clean
of
all
thoughts
whether
pleasant
or
unpleasant
shopping
was
the
topic
that
now
ensued
under
the
chaplain
'
s
guidance
they
selected
many
hideous
presents
and
mementoes
florid
little
picture
-
frames
that
seemed
fashioned
in
gilded
pastry
other
little
frames
more
severe
that
stood
on
little
easels
and
were
carven
out
of
oak
a
blotting
book
of
vellum
a
dante
of
the
same
material
cheap
mosaic
brooches
which
the
maids
next
christmas
would
never
tell
from
real
pins
pots
heraldic
saucers
brown
art
-
photographs
eros
and
psyche
in
alabaster
st
peter
to
match
all
of
which
would
have
cost
less
in
london
this
successful
morning
left
no
pleasant
impressions
on
lucy
she
had
been
a
little
frightened
both
by
miss
lavish
and
by
mr
eager
she
knew
not
why
and
as
they
frightened
her
she
had
strangely
enough
ceased
to
respect
them
she
doubted
that
miss
lavish
was
a
great
artist
she
doubted
that
mr
eager
was
as
full
of
spirituality
and
culture
as
she
had
been
led
to
suppose
they
were
tried
by
some
new
test
and
they
were
found
wanting
as
for
charlotte
as
for
charlotte
she
was
exactly
the
same
it
might
be
possible
to
be
nice
to
her
it
was
impossible
to
love
her
the
son
of
a
labourer
i
happen
to
know
it
for
a
fact
a
mechanic
of
some
sort
himself
when
he
was
young
then
he
took
to
writing
for
the
socialistic
press
i
came
across
him
at
brixton
they
were
talking
about
the
emersons
how
wonderfully
people
rise
in
these
days
sighed
miss
bartlett
fingering
a
model
of
the
leaning
tower
of
pisa
generally
replied
mr
eager
one
has
only
sympathy
for
their
success
the
desire
for
education
and
for
social
advance
in
these
things
there
is
something
not
wholly
vile
there
are
some
working
men
whom
one
would
be
very
willing
to
see
out
here
in
florence
little
as
they
would
make
of
it
is
he
a
journalist
now
miss
bartlett
asked
he
is
not
he
made
an
advantageous
marriage
he
uttered
this
remark
with
a
voice
full
of
meaning
and
ended
with
a
sigh
oh
so
he
has
a
wife
dead
miss
bartlett
dead
i
wonder
yes
i
wonder
how
he
has
the
effrontery
to
look
me
in
the
face
to
dare
to
claim
acquaintance
with
me
he
was
in
my
london
parish
long
ago
the
other
day
in
santa
croce
when
he
was
with
miss
honeychurch
i
snubbed
him
let
him
beware
that
he
does
not
get
more
than
a
snub
what
cried
lucy
flushing
exposure
hissed
mr
eager
he
tried
to
change
the
subject
but
in
scoring
a
dramatic
point
he
had
interested
his
audience
more
than
he
had
intended
miss
bartlett
was
full
of
very
natural
curiosity
lucy
though
she
wished
never
to
see
the
emersons
again
was
not
disposed
to
condemn
them
on
a
single
word
do
you
mean
she
asked
that
he
is
an
irreligious
man
we
know
that
already
lucy
dear
said
miss
bartlett
gently
reproving
her
cousin
'
s
penetration
i
should
be
astonished
if
you
knew
all
the
boy
an
innocent
child
at
the
time
i
will
exclude
god
knows
what
his
education
and
his
inherited
qualities
may
have
made
him
perhaps
said
miss
bartlett
it
is
something
that
we
had
better
not
hear
to
speak
plainly
said
mr
eager
it
is
i
will
say
no
more
for
the
first
time
lucy
'
s
rebellious
thoughts
swept
out
in
words
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
you
have
said
very
little
it
was
my
intention
to
say
very
little
was
his
frigid
reply
he
gazed
indignantly
at
the
girl
who
met
him
with
equal
indignation
she
turned
towards
him
from
the
shop
counter
her
breast
heaved
quickly
he
observed
her
brow
and
the
sudden
strength
of
her
lips
it
was
intolerable
that
she
should
disbelieve
him
murder
if
you
want
to
know
he
cried
angrily
that
man
murdered
his
wife
how
she
retorted
to
all
intents
and
purposes
he
murdered
her
that
day
in
santa
croce
did
they
say
anything
against
me
not
a
word
mr
eager
not
a
single
word
oh
i
thought
they
had
been
libelling
me
to
you
but
i
suppose
it
is
only
their
personal
charms
that
makes
you
defend
them
i
am
not
defending
them
said
lucy
losing
her
courage
and
relapsing
into
the
old
chaotic
methods
they
are
nothing
to
me
how
could
you
think
she
was
defending
them
said
miss
bartlett
much
discomfited
by
the
unpleasant
scene
the
shopman
was
possibly
listening
she
will
find
it
difficult
for
that
man
has
murdered
his
wife
in
the
sight
of
god
the
addition
of
god
was
striking
but
the
chaplain
was
really
trying
to
qualify
a
rash
remark
a
silence
followed
which
might
have
been
impressive
but
was
merely
awkward
then
miss
bartlett
hastily
purchased
the
leaning
tower
and
led
the
way
into
the
street
i
must
be
going
said
he
shutting
his
eyes
and
taking
out
his
watch
miss
bartlett
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
and
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
the
approaching
drive
drive
oh
is
our
drive
to
come
off
lucy
was
recalled
to
her
manners
and
after
a
little
exertion
the
complacency
of
mr
eager
was
restored
bother
the
drive
exclaimed
the
girl
as
soon
as
he
had
departed
it
is
just
the
drive
we
had
arranged
with
mr
beebe
without
any
fuss
at
all
why
should
he
invite
us
in
that
absurd
manner
we
might
as
well
invite
him
we
are
each
paying
for
ourselves
miss
bartlett
who
had
intended
to
lament
over
the
emersons
was
launched
by
this
remark
into
unexpected
thoughts
if
that
is
so
dear
if
the
drive
we
and
mr
beebe
are
going
with
mr
eager
is
really
the
same
as
the
one
we
are
going
with
mr
beebe
then
i
foresee
a
sad
kettle
of
fish
how
because
mr
beebe
has
asked
eleanor
lavish
to
come
too
that
will
mean
another
carriage
far
worse
mr
eager
does
not
like
eleanor
she
knows
it
herself
the
truth
must
be
told
she
is
too
unconventional
for
him
they
were
now
in
the
newspaper
-
room
at
the
english
bank
lucy
stood
by
the
central
table
heedless
of
punch
and
the
graphic
trying
to
answer
or
at
all
events
to
formulate
the
questions
rioting
in
her
brain
the
well
-
known
world
had
broken
up
and
there
emerged
florence
a
magic
city
where
people
thought
and
did
the
most
extraordinary
things
murder
accusations
of
murder
a
lady
clinging
to
one
man
and
being
rude
to
another
were
these
the
daily
incidents
of
her
streets
was
there
more
in
her
frank
beauty
than
met
the
eye
the
power
perhaps
to
evoke
passions
good
and
bad
and
to
bring
them
speedily
to
a
fulfillment
happy
charlotte
who
though
greatly
troubled
over
things
that
did
not
matter
seemed
oblivious
to
things
that
did
who
could
conjecture
with
admirable
delicacy
where
things
might
lead
to
but
apparently
lost
sight
of
the
goal
as
she
approached
it
now
she
was
crouching
in
the
corner
trying
to
extract
a
circular
note
from
a
kind
of
linen
nose
-
bag
which
hung
in
chaste
concealment
round
her
neck
she
had
been
told
that
this
was
the
only
safe
way
to
carry
money
in
italy
it
must
only
be
broached
within
the
walls
of
the
english
bank
as
she
groped
she
murmured
whether
it
is
mr
beebe
who
forgot
to
tell
mr
eager
or
mr
eager
who
forgot
when
he
told
us
or
whether
they
have
decided
to
leave
eleanor
out
altogether
which
they
could
scarcely
do
but
in
any
case
we
must
be
prepared
it
is
you
they
really
want
i
am
only
asked
for
appearances
you
shall
go
with
the
two
gentlemen
and
i
and
eleanor
will
follow
behind
a
one
-
horse
carriage
would
do
for
us
yet
how
difficult
it
is
it
is
indeed
replied
the
girl
with
a
gravity
that
sounded
sympathetic
what
do
you
think
about
it
asked
miss
bartlett
flushed
from
the
struggle
and
buttoning
up
her
dress
i
do
not
know
what
i
think
nor
what
i
want
oh
dear
lucy
i
do
hope
florence
is
not
boring
you
speak
the
word
and
as
you
know
i
would
take
you
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
-
morrow
thank
you
charlotte
said
lucy
and
pondered
over
the
offer
there
were
letters
for
her
at
the
bureau
one
from
her
brother
full
of
athletics
and
biology
one
from
her
mother
delightful
as
only
her
mother
'
s
letters
could
be
she
had
read
in
it
of
the
crocuses
which
had
been
bought
for
yellow
and
were
coming
up
puce
of
the
new
parlour
-
maid
who
had
watered
the
ferns
with
essence
of
lemonade
of
the
semi
-
detached
cottages
which
were
ruining
summer
street
and
breaking
the
heart
of
sir
harry
otway
she
recalled
the
free
pleasant
life
of
her
home
where
she
was
allowed
to
do
everything
and
where
nothing
ever
happened
to
her
the
road
up
through
the
pine
-
woods
the
clean
drawing
-
room
the
view
over
the
sussex
weald
all
hung
before
her
bright
and
distinct
but
pathetic
as
the
pictures
in
a
gallery
to
which
after
much
experience
a
traveller
returns
and
the
news
asked
miss
bartlett
mrs
vyse
and
her
son
have
gone
to
rome
said
lucy
giving
the
news
that
interested
her
least
do
you
know
the
vyses
oh
not
that
way
back
we
can
never
have
too
much
of
the
dear
piazza
signoria
they
are
nice
people
the
vyses
so
clever
my
idea
of
what
'
s
really
clever
do
not
you
long
to
be
in
rome
i
die
for
it
the
piazza
signoria
is
too
stony
to
be
brilliant
it
has
no
grass
no
flowers
no
frescoes
no
glittering
walls
of
marble
or
comforting
patches
of
ruddy
brick
by
an
odd
chance
unless
we
believe
in
a
presiding
genius
of
places
the
statues
that
relieve
its
severity
suggest
not
the
innocence
of
childhood
nor
the
glorious
bewilderment
of
youth
but
the
conscious
achievements
of
maturity
perseus
and
judith
hercules
and
thusnelda
they
have
done
or
suffered
something
and
though
they
are
immortal
immortality
has
come
to
them
after
experience
not
before
here
not
only
in
the
solitude
of
nature
might
a
hero
meet
a
goddess
or
a
heroine
a
god
charlotte
cried
the
girl
suddenly
here
'
s
an
idea
what
if
we
popped
off
to
rome
to
-
morrow
straight
to
the
vyses
'
hotel
for
i
do
know
what
i
want
i
am
sick
of
florence
no
you
said
you
'
d
go
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
do
do
miss
bartlett
with
equal
vivacity
replied
oh
you
droll
person
pray
what
would
become
of
your
drive
in
the
hills
they
passed
together
through
the
gaunt
beauty
of
the
square
laughing
over
the
unpractical
suggestion
it
was
phaethon
who
drove
them
to
fiesole
that
memorable
day
a
youth
all
irresponsibility
and
fire
recklessly
urging
his
master
'
s
horses
up
the
stony
hill
mr
beebe
recognized
him
at
once
neither
the
ages
of
faith
nor
the
age
of
doubt
had
touched
him
he
was
phaethon
in
tuscany
driving
a
cab
and
it
was
persephone
whom
he
asked
leave
to
pick
up
on
the
way
saying
that
she
was
his
sister
persephone
tall
and
slender
and
pale
returning
with
the
spring
to
her
mother
'
s
cottage
and
still
shading
her
eyes
from
the
unaccustomed
light
to
her
mr
eager
objected
saying
that
here
was
the
thin
edge
of
the
wedge
and
one
must
guard
against
imposition
but
the
ladies
interceded
and
when
it
had
been
made
clear
that
it
was
a
very
great
favour
the
goddess
was
allowed
to
mount
beside
the
god
phaethon
at
once
slipped
the
left
rein
over
her
head
thus
enabling
himself
to
drive
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
she
did
not
mind
mr
eager
who
sat
with
his
back
to
the
horses
saw
nothing
of
the
indecorous
proceeding
and
continued
his
conversation
with
lucy
the
other
two
occupants
of
the
carriage
were
old
mr
emerson
and
miss
lavish
for
a
dreadful
thing
had
happened
mr
beebe
without
consulting
mr
eager
had
doubled
the
size
of
the
party
and
though
miss
bartlett
and
miss
lavish
had
planned
all
the
morning
how
the
people
were
to
sit
at
the
critical
moment
when
the
carriages
came
round
they
lost
their
heads
and
miss
lavish
got
in
with
lucy
while
miss
bartlett
with
george
emerson
and
mr
beebe
followed
on
behind
it
was
hard
on
the
poor
chaplain
to
have
his
partie
carree
thus
transformed
tea
at
a
renaissance
villa
if
he
had
ever
meditated
it
was
now
impossible
lucy
and
miss
bartlett
had
a
certain
style
about
them
and
mr
beebe
though
unreliable
was
a
man
of
parts
but
a
shoddy
lady
writer
and
a
journalist
who
had
murdered
his
wife
in
the
sight
of
god
they
should
enter
no
villa
at
his
introduction
lucy
elegantly
dressed
in
white
sat
erect
and
nervous
amid
these
explosive
ingredients
attentive
to
mr
eager
repressive
towards
miss
lavish
watchful
of
old
mr
emerson
hitherto
fortunately
asleep
thanks
to
a
heavy
lunch
and
the
drowsy
atmosphere
of
spring
she
looked
on
the
expedition
as
the
work
of
fate
but
for
it
she
would
have
avoided
george
emerson
successfully
in
an
open
manner
he
had
shown
that
he
wished
to
continue
their
intimacy
she
had
refused
not
because
she
disliked
him
but
because
she
did
not
know
what
had
happened
and
suspected
that
he
did
know
and
this
frightened
her
for
the
real
event
whatever
it
was
had
taken
place
not
in
the
loggia
but
by
the
river
to
behave
wildly
at
the
sight
of
death
is
pardonable
but
to
discuss
it
afterwards
to
pass
from
discussion
into
silence
and
through
silence
into
sympathy
that
is
an
error
not
of
a
startled
emotion
but
of
the
whole
fabric
there
was
really
something
blameworthy
(
she
thought
)
in
their
joint
contemplation
of
the
shadowy
stream
in
the
common
impulse
which
had
turned
them
to
the
house
without
the
passing
of
a
look
or
word
this
sense
of
wickedness
had
been
slight
at
first
she
had
nearly
joined
the
party
to
the
torre
del
gallo
but
each
time
that
she
avoided
george
it
became
more
imperative
that
she
should
avoid
him
again
and
now
celestial
irony
working
through
her
cousin
and
two
clergymen
did
not
suffer
her
to
leave
florence
till
she
had
made
this
expedition
with
him
through
the
hills
meanwhile
mr
eager
held
her
in
civil
converse
their
little
tiff
was
over
so
miss
honeychurch
you
are
travelling
as
a
student
of
art
oh
dear
me
no
oh
no
perhaps
as
a
student
of
human
nature
interposed
miss
lavish
like
myself
oh
no
i
am
here
as
a
tourist
oh
indeed
said
mr
eager
are
you
indeed
if
you
will
not
think
me
rude
we
residents
sometimes
pity
you
poor
tourists
not
a
little
handed
about
like
a
parcel
of
goods
from
venice
to
florence
from
florence
to
rome
living
herded
together
in
pensions
or
hotels
quite
unconscious
of
anything
that
is
outside
baedeker
their
one
anxiety
to
get
'
done
'
or
'
through
'
and
go
on
somewhere
else
the
result
is
they
mix
up
towns
rivers
palaces
in
one
inextricable
whirl
you
know
the
american
girl
in
punch
who
says
'
say
poppa
what
did
we
see
at
rome
'
and
the
father
replies
'
why
guess
rome
was
the
place
where
we
saw
the
yaller
dog
'
there
'
s
travelling
for
you
ha
ha
ha
i
quite
agree
said
miss
lavish
who
had
several
times
tried
to
interrupt
his
mordant
wit
the
narrowness
and
superficiality
of
the
anglo
-
saxon
tourist
is
nothing
less
than
a
menace
quite
so
now
the
english
colony
at
florence
miss
honeychurch
and
it
is
of
considerable
size
though
of
course
not
all
equally
a
few
are
here
for
trade
for
example
but
the
greater
part
are
students
lady
helen
laverstock
is
at
present
busy
over
fra
angelico
i
mention
her
name
because
we
are
passing
her
villa
on
the
left
no
you
can
only
see
it
if
you
stand
no
do
not
stand
you
will
fall
she
is
very
proud
of
that
thick
hedge
inside
perfect
seclusion
one
might
have
gone
back
six
hundred
years
some
critics
believe
that
her
garden
was
the
scene
of
the
decameron
which
lends
it
an
additional
interest
does
it
not
it
does
indeed
cried
miss
lavish
tell
me
where
do
they
place
the
scene
of
that
wonderful
seventh
day
but
mr
eager
proceeded
to
tell
miss
honeychurch
that
on
the
right
lived
mr
someone
something
an
american
of
the
best
type
so
rare
and
that
the
somebody
elses
were
farther
down
the
hill
doubtless
you
know
her
monographs
in
the
series
of
'
mediaeval
byways
'
he
is
working
at
gemistus
pletho
sometimes
as
i
take
tea
in
their
beautiful
grounds
i
hear
over
the
wall
the
electric
tram
squealing
up
the
new
road
with
its
loads
of
hot
dusty
unintelligent
tourists
who
are
going
to
'
do
'
fiesole
in
an
hour
in
order
that
they
may
say
they
have
been
there
and
i
think
think
i
think
how
little
they
think
what
lies
so
near
them
during
this
speech
the
two
figures
on
the
box
were
sporting
with
each
other
disgracefully
lucy
had
a
spasm
of
envy
granted
that
they
wished
to
misbehave
it
was
pleasant
for
them
to
be
able
to
do
so
they
were
probably
the
only
people
enjoying
the
expedition
the
carriage
swept
with
agonizing
jolts
up
through
the
piazza
of
fiesole
and
into
the
settignano
road
piano
piano
said
mr
eager
elegantly
waving
his
hand
over
his
head
va
bene
signore
va
bene
va
bene
crooned
the
driver
and
whipped
his
horses
up
again
now
mr
eager
and
miss
lavish
began
to
talk
against
each
other
on
the
subject
of
alessio
baldovinetti
was
he
a
cause
of
the
renaissance
or
was
he
one
of
its
manifestations
the
other
carriage
was
left
behind
as
the
pace
increased
to
a
gallop
the
large
slumbering
form
of
mr
emerson
was
thrown
against
the
chaplain
with
the
regularity
of
a
machine
piano
piano
said
he
with
a
martyred
look
at
lucy
an
extra
lurch
made
him
turn
angrily
in
his
seat
phaethon
who
for
some
time
had
been
endeavouring
to
kiss
persephone
had
just
succeeded
a
little
scene
ensued
which
as
miss
bartlett
said
afterwards
was
most
unpleasant
the
horses
were
stopped
the
lovers
were
ordered
to
disentangle
themselves
the
boy
was
to
lose
his
pourboire
the
girl
was
immediately
to
get
down
she
is
my
sister
said
he
turning
round
on
them
with
piteous
eyes
mr
eager
took
the
trouble
to
tell
him
that
he
was
a
liar
phaethon
hung
down
his
head
not
at
the
matter
of
the
accusation
but
at
its
manner
at
this
point
mr
emerson
whom
the
shock
of
stopping
had
awoke
declared
that
the
lovers
must
on
no
account
be
separated
and
patted
them
on
the
back
to
signify
his
approval
and
miss
lavish
though
unwilling
to
ally
him
felt
bound
to
support
the
cause
of
bohemianism
most
certainly
i
would
let
them
be
she
cried
but
i
dare
say
i
shall
receive
scant
support
i
have
always
flown
in
the
face
of
the
conventions
all
my
life
this
is
what
i
call
an
adventure
we
must
not
submit
said
mr
eager
i
knew
he
was
trying
it
on
he
is
treating
us
as
if
we
were
a
party
of
cook
'
s
tourists
surely
no
said
miss
lavish
her
ardour
visibly
decreasing
the
other
carriage
had
drawn
up
behind
and
sensible
mr
beebe
called
out
that
after
this
warning
the
couple
would
be
sure
to
behave
themselves
properly
leave
them
alone
mr
emerson
begged
the
chaplain
of
whom
he
stood
in
no
awe
do
we
find
happiness
so
often
that
we
should
turn
it
off
the
box
when
it
happens
to
sit
there
to
be
driven
by
lovers
a
king
might
envy
us
and
if
we
part
them
it
is
more
like
sacrilege
than
anything
i
know
here
the
voice
of
miss
bartlett
was
heard
saying
that
a
crowd
had
begun
to
collect
mr
eager
who
suffered
from
an
over
-
fluent
tongue
rather
than
a
resolute
will
was
determined
to
make
himself
heard
he
addressed
the
driver
again
italian
in
the
mouth
of
italians
is
a
deep
-
voiced
stream
with
unexpected
cataracts
and
boulders
to
preserve
it
from
monotony
in
mr
eager
'
s
mouth
it
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
an
acid
whistling
fountain
which
played
ever
higher
and
higher
and
quicker
and
quicker
and
more
and
more
shrilly
till
abruptly
it
was
turned
off
with
a
click
signorina
said
the
man
to
lucy
when
the
display
had
ceased
why
should
he
appeal
to
lucy
signorina
echoed
persephone
in
her
glorious
contralto
she
pointed
at
the
other
carriage
why
for
a
moment
the
two
girls
looked
at
each
other
then
persephone
got
down
from
the
box
victory
at
last
said
mr
eager
smiting
his
hands
together
as
the
carriages
started
again
it
is
not
victory
said
mr
emerson
it
is
defeat
you
have
parted
two
people
who
were
happy
mr
eager
shut
his
eyes
he
was
obliged
to
sit
next
to
mr
emerson
but
he
would
not
speak
to
him
the
old
man
was
refreshed
by
sleep
and
took
up
the
matter
warmly
he
commanded
lucy
to
agree
with
him
he
shouted
for
support
to
his
son
we
have
tried
to
buy
what
cannot
be
bought
with
money
he
has
bargained
to
drive
us
and
he
is
doing
it
we
have
no
rights
over
his
soul
miss
lavish
frowned
it
is
hard
when
a
person
you
have
classed
as
typically
british
speaks
out
of
his
character
he
was
not
driving
us
well
she
said
he
jolted
us
that
i
deny
it
was
as
restful
as
sleeping
aha
he
is
jolting
us
now
can
you
wonder
he
would
like
to
throw
us
out
and
most
certainly
he
is
justified
and
if
i
were
superstitious
i
'
d
be
frightened
of
the
girl
too
it
does
not
do
to
injure
young
people
have
you
ever
heard
of
lorenzo
de
medici
miss
lavish
bristled
most
certainly
i
have
do
you
refer
to
lorenzo
il
magnifico
or
to
lorenzo
duke
of
urbino
or
to
lorenzo
surnamed
lorenzino
on
account
of
his
diminutive
stature
the
lord
knows
possibly
he
does
know
for
i
refer
to
lorenzo
the
poet
he
wrote
a
line
so
i
heard
yesterday
which
runs
like
this
'
do
not
go
fighting
against
the
spring
'
mr
eager
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
for
erudition
non
fate
guerra
al
maggio
he
murmured
'
war
not
with
the
may
'
would
render
a
correct
meaning
the
point
is
we
have
warred
with
it
look
he
pointed
to
the
val
d
'
arno
which
was
visible
far
below
them
through
the
budding
trees
fifty
miles
of
spring
and
we
'
ve
come
up
to
admire
them
do
you
suppose
there
'
s
any
difference
between
spring
in
nature
and
spring
in
man
but
there
we
go
praising
the
one
and
condemning
the
other
as
improper
ashamed
that
the
same
work
eternally
through
both
no
one
encouraged
him
to
talk
presently
mr
eager
gave
a
signal
for
the
carriages
to
stop
and
marshalled
the
party
for
their
ramble
on
the
hill
a
hollow
like
a
great
amphitheatre
full
of
terraced
steps
and
misty
olives
now
lay
between
them
and
the
heights
of
fiesole
and
the
road
still
following
its
curve
was
about
to
sweep
on
to
a
promontory
which
stood
out
in
the
plain
it
was
this
promontory
uncultivated
wet
covered
with
bushes
and
occasional
trees
which
had
caught
the
fancy
of
alessio
baldovinetti
nearly
five
hundred
years
before
he
had
ascended
it
that
diligent
and
rather
obscure
master
possibly
with
an
eye
to
business
possibly
for
the
joy
of
ascending
standing
there
he
had
seen
that
view
of
the
val
d
'
arno
and
distant
florence
which
he
afterwards
had
introduced
not
very
effectively
into
his
work
but
where
exactly
had
he
stood
that
was
the
question
which
mr
eager
hoped
to
solve
now
and
miss
lavish
whose
nature
was
attracted
by
anything
problematical
had
become
equally
enthusiastic
but
it
is
not
easy
to
carry
the
pictures
of
alessio
baldovinetti
in
your
head
even
if
you
have
remembered
to
look
at
them
before
starting
and
the
haze
in
the
valley
increased
the
difficulty
of
the
quest
the
party
sprang
about
from
tuft
to
tuft
of
grass
their
anxiety
to
keep
together
being
only
equalled
by
their
desire
to
go
different
directions
finally
they
split
into
groups
lucy
clung
to
miss
bartlett
and
miss
lavish
the
emersons
returned
to
hold
laborious
converse
with
the
drivers
while
the
two
clergymen
who
were
expected
to
have
topics
in
common
were
left
to
each
other
the
two
elder
ladies
soon
threw
off
the
mask
in
the
audible
whisper
that
was
now
so
familiar
to
lucy
they
began
to
discuss
not
alessio
baldovinetti
but
the
drive
miss
bartlett
had
asked
mr
george
emerson
what
his
profession
was
and
he
had
answered
the
railway
she
was
very
sorry
that
she
had
asked
him
she
had
no
idea
that
it
would
be
such
a
dreadful
answer
or
she
would
not
have
asked
him
mr
beebe
had
turned
the
conversation
so
cleverly
and
she
hoped
that
the
young
man
was
not
very
much
hurt
at
her
asking
him
the
railway
gasped
miss
lavish
oh
but
i
shall
die
of
course
it
was
the
railway
she
could
not
control
her
mirth
he
is
the
image
of
a
porter
on
on
the
south
-
eastern
eleanor
be
quiet
plucking
at
her
vivacious
companion
hush
they
will
hear
the
emersons
i
ca
not
stop
let
me
go
my
wicked
way
a
porter
eleanor
i
am
sure
it
is
all
right
put
in
lucy
the
emersons
wo
not
hear
and
they
would
not
mind
if
they
did
miss
lavish
did
not
seem
pleased
at
this
miss
honeychurch
listening
she
said
rather
crossly
pouf
wouf
you
naughty
girl
go
away
oh
lucy
you
ought
to
be
with
mr
eager
i
am
sure
i
ca
not
find
them
now
and
i
do
not
want
to
either
mr
eager
will
be
offended
it
is
your
party
please
i
'
d
rather
stop
here
with
you
no
i
agree
said
miss
lavish
it
is
like
a
school
feast
the
boys
have
got
separated
from
the
girls
miss
lucy
you
are
to
go
we
wish
to
converse
on
high
topics
unsuited
for
your
ear
the
girl
was
stubborn
as
her
time
at
florence
drew
to
its
close
she
was
only
at
ease
amongst
those
to
whom
she
felt
indifferent
such
a
one
was
miss
lavish
and
such
for
the
moment
was
charlotte
she
wished
she
had
not
called
attention
to
herself
they
were
both
annoyed
at
her
remark
and
seemed
determined
to
get
rid
of
her
how
tired
one
gets
said
miss
bartlett
oh
i
do
wish
freddy
and
your
mother
could
be
here
unselfishness
with
miss
bartlett
had
entirely
usurped
the
functions
of
enthusiasm
lucy
did
not
look
at
the
view
either
she
would
not
enjoy
anything
till
she
was
safe
at
rome
then
sit
you
down
said
miss
lavish
observe
my
foresight
with
many
a
smile
she
produced
two
of
those
mackintosh
squares
that
protect
the
frame
of
the
tourist
from
damp
grass
or
cold
marble
steps
she
sat
on
one
who
was
to
sit
on
the
other
lucy
without
a
moment
'
s
doubt
lucy
the
ground
will
do
for
me
really
i
have
not
had
rheumatism
for
years
if
i
do
feel
it
coming
on
i
shall
stand
imagine
your
mother
'
s
feelings
if
i
let
you
sit
in
the
wet
in
your
white
linen
she
sat
down
heavily
where
the
ground
looked
particularly
moist
here
we
are
all
settled
delightfully
even
if
my
dress
is
thinner
it
will
not
show
so
much
being
brown
sit
down
dear
you
are
too
unselfish
you
do
not
assert
yourself
enough
she
cleared
her
throat
now
do
not
be
alarmed
this
is
not
a
cold
it
is
the
tiniest
cough
and
i
have
had
it
three
days
it
is
nothing
to
do
with
sitting
here
at
all
there
was
only
one
way
of
treating
the
situation
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
lucy
departed
in
search
of
mr
beebe
and
mr
eager
vanquished
by
the
mackintosh
square
she
addressed
herself
to
the
drivers
who
were
sprawling
in
the
carriages
perfuming
the
cushions
with
cigars
the
miscreant
a
bony
young
man
scorched
black
by
the
sun
rose
to
greet
her
with
the
courtesy
of
a
host
and
the
assurance
of
a
relative
dove
said
lucy
after
much
anxious
thought
his
face
lit
up
of
course
he
knew
where
not
so
far
either
his
arm
swept
three
-
fourths
of
the
horizon
he
should
just
think
he
did
know
where
he
pressed
his
finger
-
tips
to
his
forehead
and
then
pushed
them
towards
her
as
if
oozing
with
visible
extract
of
knowledge
more
seemed
necessary
what
was
the
italian
for
clergyman
dove
buoni
uomini
said
she
at
last
good
scarcely
the
adjective
for
those
noble
beings
he
showed
her
his
cigar
uno
piu
piccolo
was
her
next
remark
implying
has
the
cigar
been
given
to
you
by
mr
beebe
the
smaller
of
the
two
good
men
she
was
correct
as
usual
he
tied
the
horse
to
a
tree
kicked
it
to
make
it
stay
quiet
dusted
the
carriage
arranged
his
hair
remoulded
his
hat
encouraged
his
moustache
and
in
rather
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
minute
was
ready
to
conduct
her
italians
are
born
knowing
the
way
it
would
seem
that
the
whole
earth
lay
before
them
not
as
a
map
but
as
a
chess
-
board
whereon
they
continually
behold
the
changing
pieces
as
well
as
the
squares
any
one
can
find
places
but
the
finding
of
people
is
a
gift
from
god
he
only
stopped
once
to
pick
her
some
great
blue
violets
she
thanked
him
with
real
pleasure
in
the
company
of
this
common
man
the
world
was
beautiful
and
direct
for
the
first
time
she
felt
the
influence
of
spring
his
arm
swept
the
horizon
gracefully
violets
like
other
things
existed
in
great
profusion
there
would
she
like
to
see
them
ma
buoni
uomini
he
bowed
certainly
good
men
first
violets
afterwards
they
proceeded
briskly
through
the
undergrowth
which
became
thicker
and
thicker
they
were
nearing
the
edge
of
the
promontory
and
the
view
was
stealing
round
them
but
the
brown
network
of
the
bushes
shattered
it
into
countless
pieces
he
was
occupied
in
his
cigar
and
in
holding
back
the
pliant
boughs
she
was
rejoicing
in
her
escape
from
dullness
not
a
step
not
a
twig
was
unimportant
to
her
what
is
that
there
was
a
voice
in
the
wood
in
the
distance
behind
them
the
voice
of
mr
eager
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
an
italian
'
s
ignorance
is
sometimes
more
remarkable
than
his
knowledge
she
could
not
make
him
understand
that
perhaps
they
had
missed
the
clergymen
the
view
was
forming
at
last
she
could
discern
the
river
the
golden
plain
other
hills
eccolo
he
exclaimed
at
the
same
moment
the
ground
gave
way
and
with
a
cry
she
fell
out
of
the
wood
light
and
beauty
enveloped
her
she
had
fallen
on
to
a
little
open
terrace
which
was
covered
with
violets
from
end
to
end
courage
cried
her
companion
now
standing
some
six
feet
above
courage
and
love
she
did
not
answer
from
her
feet
the
ground
sloped
sharply
into
view
and
violets
ran
down
in
rivulets
and
streams
and
cataracts
irrigating
the
hillside
with
blue
eddying
round
the
tree
stems
collecting
into
pools
in
the
hollows
covering
the
grass
with
spots
of
azure
foam
but
never
again
were
they
in
such
profusion
this
terrace
was
the
well
-
head
the
primal
source
whence
beauty
gushed
out
to
water
the
earth
standing
at
its
brink
like
a
swimmer
who
prepares
was
the
good
man
but
he
was
not
the
good
man
that
she
had
expected
and
he
was
alone
george
had
turned
at
the
sound
of
her
arrival
for
a
moment
he
contemplated
her
as
one
who
had
fallen
out
of
heaven
he
saw
radiant
joy
in
her
face
he
saw
the
flowers
beat
against
her
dress
in
blue
waves
the
bushes
above
them
closed
he
stepped
quickly
forward
and
kissed
her
before
she
could
speak
almost
before
she
could
feel
a
voice
called
lucy
lucy
lucy
the
silence
of
life
had
been
broken
by
miss
bartlett
who
stood
brown
against
the
view
some
complicated
game
had
been
playing
up
and
down
the
hillside
all
the
afternoon
what
it
was
and
exactly
how
the
players
had
sided
lucy
was
slow
to
discover
mr
eager
had
met
them
with
a
questioning
eye
charlotte
had
repulsed
him
with
much
small
talk
mr
emerson
seeking
his
son
was
told
whereabouts
to
find
him
mr
beebe
who
wore
the
heated
aspect
of
a
neutral
was
bidden
to
collect
the
factions
for
the
return
home
there
was
a
general
sense
of
groping
and
bewilderment
pan
had
been
amongst
them
not
the
great
god
pan
who
has
been
buried
these
two
thousand
years
but
the
little
god
pan
who
presides
over
social
contretemps
and
unsuccessful
picnics
mr
beebe
had
lost
every
one
and
had
consumed
in
solitude
the
tea
-
basket
which
he
had
brought
up
as
a
pleasant
surprise
miss
lavish
had
lost
miss
bartlett
lucy
had
lost
mr
eager
mr
emerson
had
lost
george
miss
bartlett
had
lost
a
mackintosh
square
phaethon
had
lost
the
game
that
last
fact
was
undeniable
he
climbed
on
to
the
box
shivering
with
his
collar
up
prophesying
the
swift
approach
of
bad
weather
let
us
go
immediately
he
told
them
the
signorino
will
walk
all
the
way
he
will
be
hours
said
mr
beebe
apparently
i
told
him
it
was
unwise
he
would
look
no
one
in
the
face
perhaps
defeat
was
particularly
mortifying
for
him
he
alone
had
played
skilfully
using
the
whole
of
his
instinct
while
the
others
had
used
scraps
of
their
intelligence
he
alone
had
divined
what
things
were
and
what
he
wished
them
to
be
he
alone
had
interpreted
the
message
that
lucy
had
received
five
days
before
from
the
lips
of
a
dying
man
persephone
who
spends
half
her
life
in
the
grave
she
could
interpret
it
also
not
so
these
english
they
gain
knowledge
slowly
and
perhaps
too
late
the
thoughts
of
a
cab
-
driver
however
just
seldom
affect
the
lives
of
his
employers
he
was
the
most
competent
of
miss
bartlett
'
s
opponents
but
infinitely
the
least
dangerous
once
back
in
the
town
he
and
his
insight
and
his
knowledge
would
trouble
english
ladies
no
more
of
course
it
was
most
unpleasant
she
had
seen
his
black
head
in
the
bushes
he
might
make
a
tavern
story
out
of
it
but
after
all
what
have
we
to
do
with
taverns
real
menace
belongs
to
the
drawing
-
room
it
was
of
drawing
-
room
people
that
miss
bartlett
thought
as
she
journeyed
downwards
towards
the
fading
sun
lucy
sat
beside
her
mr
eager
sat
opposite
trying
to
catch
her
eye
he
was
vaguely
suspicious
they
spoke
of
alessio
baldovinetti
rain
and
darkness
came
on
together
the
two
ladies
huddled
together
under
an
inadequate
parasol
there
was
a
lightning
flash
and
miss
lavish
who
was
nervous
screamed
from
the
carriage
in
front
at
the
next
flash
lucy
screamed
also
mr
eager
addressed
her
professionally
courage
miss
honeychurch
courage
and
faith
if
i
might
say
so
there
is
something
almost
blasphemous
in
this
horror
of
the
elements
are
we
seriously
to
suppose
that
all
these
clouds
all
this
immense
electrical
display
is
simply
called
into
existence
to
extinguish
you
or
me
