on
the
evening
of
the
interview
referred
to
,
the
master
went
abroad
;
he
was
abroad
a
great
deal
of
the
next
day
also
,
that
fatal
27th
;
but
where
he
went
,
or
what
he
did
,
we
never
concerned
ourselves
to
ask
until
next
day
.
if
we
had
done
so
,
and
by
any
chance
found
out
,
it
might
have
changed
all
.
but
as
all
we
did
was
done
in
ignorance
,
and
should
be
so
judged
,
i
shall
so
narrate
these
passages
as
they
appeared
to
us
in
the
moment
of
their
birth
,
and
reserve
all
that
i
since
discovered
for
the
time
of
its
discovery
.
for
i
have
now
come
to
one
of
the
dark
parts
of
my
narrative
,
and
must
engage
the
reader
'
s
indulgence
for
my
patron
.
all
the
27th
that
rigorous
weather
endured
:
a
stifling
cold
;
the
folk
passing
about
like
smoking
chimneys
;
the
wide
hearth
in
the
hall
piled
high
with
fuel
;
some
of
the
spring
birds
that
had
already
blundered
north
into
our
neighbourhood
,
besieging
the
windows
of
the
house
or
trotting
on
the
frozen
turf
like
things
distracted
.
about
noon
there
came
a
blink
of
sunshine
,
showing
a
very
pretty
,
wintry
,
frosty
landscape
of
white
hills
and
woods
,
with
crail
'
s
lugger
waiting
for
a
wind
under
the
craig
head
,
and
the
smoke
mounting
straight
into
the
air
from
every
farm
and
cottage
.
with
the
coming
of
night
,
the
haze
closed
in
overhead
;
it
fell
dark
and
still
and
starless
,
and
exceeding
cold
:
a
night
the
most
unseasonable
,
fit
for
strange
events
.
mrs
henry
withdrew
,
as
was
now
her
custom
,
very
early
.
we
had
set
ourselves
of
late
to
pass
the
evening
with
a
game
of
cards
;
another
mark
that
our
visitor
was
wearying
mightily
of
the
life
at
durrisdeer
;
and
we
had
not
been
long
at
this
when
my
old
lord
slipped
from
his
place
beside
the
fire
,
and
was
off
without
a
word
to
seek
the
warmth
of
bed
.
the
three
thus
left
together
had
neither
love
nor
courtesy
to
share
;
not
one
of
us
would
have
sat
up
one
instant
to
oblige
another
;
yet
from
the
influence
of
custom
,
and
as
the
cards
had
just
been
dealt
,
we
continued
the
form
of
playing
out
the
round
.
i
should
say
we
were
late
sitters
;
and
though
my
lord
had
departed
earlier
than
was
his
custom
,
twelve
was
already
gone
some
time
upon
the
clock
,
and
the
servants
long
ago
in
bed
.
another
thing
i
should
say
,
that
although
i
never
saw
the
master
anyway
affected
with
liquor
,
he
had
been
drinking
freely
,
and
was
perhaps
(
although
he
showed
it
not
)
a
trifle
heated
.
anyway
,
he
now
practised
one
of
his
transitions
;
and
so
soon
as
the
door
closed
behind
my
lord
,
and
without
the
smallest
change
of
voice
,
shifted
from
ordinary
civil
talk
into
a
stream
of
insult
.
"
my
dear
henry
,
it
is
yours
to
play
,
"
he
had
been
saying
,
and
now
continued
:
"
it
is
a
very
strange
thing
how
,
even
in
so
small
a
matter
as
a
game
of
cards
,
you
display
your
rusticity
.
you
play
,
jacob
,
like
a
bonnet
laird
,
or
a
sailor
in
a
tavern
.
the
same
dulness
,
the
same
petty
greed
,
cette
lenteur
d
'
hebete
qui
me
fait
rager
;
it
is
strange
i
should
have
such
a
brother
.
even
square
-
toes
has
a
certain
vivacity
when
his
stake
is
imperilled
;
but
the
dreariness
of
a
game
with
you
i
positively
lack
language
to
depict
.
"
mr
henry
continued
to
look
at
his
cards
,
as
though
very
maturely
considering
some
play
;
but
his
mind
was
elsewhere
.
"
dear
god
,
will
this
never
be
done
?
"
cries
the
master
.
"
quel
lourdeau
!
but
why
do
i
trouble
you
with
french
expressions
,
which
are
lost
on
such
an
ignoramus
?
a
lourdeau
,
my
dear
brother
,
is
as
we
might
say
a
bumpkin
,
a
clown
,
a
clodpole
:
a
fellow
without
grace
,
lightness
,
quickness
;
any
gift
of
pleasing
,
any
natural
brilliancy
:
such
a
one
as
you
shall
see
,
when
you
desire
,
by
looking
in
the
mirror
.
i
tell
you
these
things
for
your
good
,
i
assure
you
;
and
besides
,
square
-
toes
"
(
looking
at
me
and
stifling
a
yawn
)
,
"
it
is
one
of
my
diversions
in
this
very
dreary
spot
to
toast
you
and
your
master
at
the
fire
like
chestnuts
.
i
have
great
pleasure
in
your
case
,
for
i
observe
the
nickname
(
rustic
as
it
is
)
has
always
the
power
to
make
you
writhe
.
but
sometimes
i
have
more
trouble
with
this
dear
fellow
here
,
who
seems
to
have
gone
to
sleep
upon
his
cards
.
do
you
not
see
the
applicability
of
the
epithet
i
have
just
explained
,
dear
henry
?
let
me
show
you
.
for
instance
,
with
all
those
solid
qualities
which
i
delight
to
recognise
in
you
,
i
never
knew
a
woman
who
did
not
prefer
me
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
nor
,
i
think
,
"
he
continued
,
with
the
most
silken
deliberation
,
"
i
think
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
who
did
not
continue
to
prefer
me
.
"
mr
henry
laid
down
his
cards
.
he
rose
to
his
feet
very
softly
,
and
seemed
all
the
while
like
a
person
in
deep
thought
.
"
you
coward
!
"
he
said
gently
,
as
if
to
himself
.
and
then
,
with
neither
hurry
nor
any
particular
violence
,
he
struck
the
master
in
the
mouth
.
the
master
sprang
to
his
feet
like
one
transfigured
;
i
had
never
seen
the
man
so
beautiful
.
"
a
blow
!
"
he
cried
.
"
i
would
not
take
a
blow
from
god
almighty
!
"
"
lower
your
voice
,
"
said
mr
henry
.
"
do
you
wish
my
father
to
interfere
for
you
again
?
"
"
gentlemen
,
gentlemen
,
"
i
cried
,
and
sought
to
come
between
them
.
the
master
caught
me
by
the
shoulder
,
held
me
at
arm
'
s
length
,
and
still
addressing
his
brother
:
"
do
you
know
what
this
means
?
"
said
he
.
"
it
was
the
most
deliberate
act
of
my
life
,
"
says
mr
henry
.
"
i
must
have
blood
,
i
must
have
blood
for
this
,
"
says
the
master
.
"
please
god
it
shall
be
yours
,
"
said
mr
henry
;
and
he
went
to
the
wall
and
took
down
a
pair
of
swords
that
hung
there
with
others
,
naked
.
these
he
presented
to
the
master
by
the
points
.
"
mackellar
shall
see
us
play
fair
,
"
said
mr
henry
.
"
i
think
it
very
needful
.
"
"
you
need
insult
me
no
more
,
"
said
the
master
,
taking
one
of
the
swords
at
random
.
"
i
have
hated
you
all
my
life
.
"
"
my
father
is
but
newly
gone
to
bed
,
"
said
mr
henry
.
"
we
must
go
somewhere
forth
of
the
house
.
"
"
there
is
an
excellent
place
in
the
long
shrubbery
,
"
said
the
master
.
"
gentlemen
,
"
said
i
,
"
shame
upon
you
both
!
sons
of
the
same
mother
,
would
you
turn
against
the
life
she
gave
you
?
"
"
even
so
,
mackellar
,
"
said
mr
henry
,
with
the
same
perfect
quietude
of
manner
he
had
shown
throughout
.
"
it
is
what
i
will
prevent
,
"
said
i
.
and
now
here
is
a
blot
upon
my
life
.
at
these
words
of
mine
the
master
turned
his
blade
against
my
bosom
;
i
saw
the
light
run
along
the
steel
;
and
i
threw
up
my
arms
and
fell
to
my
knees
before
him
on
the
floor
.
"
no
,
no
,
"
i
cried
,
like
a
baby
.
"
we
shall
have
no
more
trouble
with
him
,
"
said
the
master
.
"
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
a
coward
in
the
house
.
"
"
we
must
have
light
,
"
said
mr
henry
,
as
though
there
had
been
no
interruption
.
"
this
trembler
can
bring
a
pair
of
candles
,
"
said
the
master
.
to
my
shame
be
it
said
,
i
was
still
so
blinded
with
the
flashing
of
that
bare
sword
that
i
volunteered
to
bring
a
lantern
.
"
we
do
not
need
a
l
-
l
-
lantern
,
"
says
the
master
,
mocking
me
.
"
there
is
no
breath
of
air
.
come
,
get
to
your
feet
,
take
a
pair
of
lights
,
and
go
before
.
i
am
close
behind
with
this
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
making
.
the
blade
glitter
as
he
spoke
.
i
took
up
the
candlesticks
and
went
before
them
,
steps
that
i
would
give
my
hand
to
recall
;
but
a
coward
is
a
slave
at
the
best
;
and
even
as
i
went
,
my
teeth
smote
each
other
in
my
mouth
.
it
was
as
he
had
said
:
there
was
no
breath
stirring
;
a
windless
stricture
of
frost
had
bound
the
air
;
and
as
we
went
forth
in
the
shine
of
the
candles
,
the
blackness
was
like
a
roof
over
our
heads
.
never
a
word
was
said
;
there
was
never
a
sound
but
the
creaking
of
our
steps
along
the
frozen
path
.
the
cold
of
the
night
fell
about
me
like
a
bucket
of
water
;
i
shook
as
i
went
with
more
than
terror
;
but
my
companions
,
bare
-
headed
like
myself
,
and
fresh
from
the
warm
ball
,
appeared
not
even
conscious
of
the
change
.
"
here
is
the
place
,
"
said
the
master
.
"
set
down
the
candles
.
"
i
did
as
he
bid
me
,
and
presently
the
flames
went
up
,
as
steady
as
in
a
chamber
,
in
the
midst
of
the
frosted
trees
,
and
i
beheld
these
two
brothers
take
their
places
.
"
the
light
is
something
in
my
eyes
,
"
said
the
master
.
"
i
will
give
you
every
advantage
,
"
replied
mr
henry
,
shifting
his
ground
,
"
for
i
think
you
are
about
to
die
.
"
he
spoke
rather
sadly
than
otherwise
,
yet
there
was
a
ring
in
his
voice
.
"
henry
durie
,
"
said
the
master
,
"
two
words
before
i
begin
.
you
are
a
fencer
,
you
can
hold
a
foil
;
you
little
know
what
a
change
it
makes
to
hold
a
sword
!
and
by
that
i
know
you
are
to
fall
.
but
see
how
strong
is
my
situation
!
if
you
fall
,
i
shift
out
of
this
country
to
where
my
money
is
before
me
.
if
i
fall
,
where
are
you
?
my
father
,
your
wife
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
who
is
in
love
with
me
,
as
you
very
well
know
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
your
child
even
,
who
prefers
me
to
yourself
:
-
how
will
these
avenge
me
!
had
you
thought
of
that
,
dear
henry
?
"
he
looked
at
his
brother
with
a
smile
;
then
made
a
fencing
-
room
salute
.
never
a
word
said
mr
henry
,
but
saluted
too
,
and
the
swords
rang
together
.
i
am
no
judge
of
the
play
;
my
head
,
besides
,
was
gone
with
cold
and
fear
and
horror
;
but
it
seems
that
mr
henry
took
and
kept
the
upper
hand
from
the
engagement
,
crowding
in
upon
his
foe
with
a
contained
and
glowing
fury
.
nearer
and
nearer
he
crept
upon
the
man
,
till
of
a
sudden
the
master
leaped
back
with
a
little
sobbing
oath
;
and
i
believe
the
movement
brought
the
light
once
more
against
his
eyes
.
to
it
they
went
again
,
on
the
fresh
ground
;
but
now
methought
closer
,
mr
henry
pressing
more
outrageously
,
the
master
beyond
doubt
with
shaken
confidence
.
for
it
is
beyond
doubt
he
now
recognised
himself
for
lost
,
and
had
some
taste
of
the
cold
agony
of
fear
;
or
he
had
never
attempted
the
foul
stroke
.
i
cannot
say
i
followed
it
,
my
untrained
eye
was
never
quick
enough
to
seize
details
,
but
it
appears
he
caught
his
brother
'
s
blade
with
his
left
hand
,
a
practice
not
permitted
.
certainly
mr
henry
only
saved
himself
by
leaping
on
one
side
;
as
certainly
the
master
,
lunging
in
the
air
,
stumbled
on
his
knee
,
and
before
he
could
move
the
sword
was
through
his
body
.
i
cried
out
with
a
stifled
scream
,
and
ran
in
;
but
the
body
was
already
fallen
to
the
ground
,
where
it
writhed
a
moment
like
a
trodden
worm
,
and
then
lay
motionless
.
"
look
at
his
left
hand
.
"
said
mr
henry
.
"
it
is
all
bloody
,
"
said
i
.
"
on
the
inside
?
"
said
he
.
"
it
is
cut
on
the
inside
,
"
said
i
.
"
i
thought
so
,
"
said
he
,
and
turned
his
back
.
i
opened
the
man
'
s
clothes
;
the
heart
was
quite
still
,
it
gave
not
a
flutter
.
"
god
forgive
us
,
mr
henry
!
"
said
i
.
"
he
is
dead
.
"
"
dead
?
"
he
repeated
,
a
little
stupidly
;
and
then
with
a
rising
tone
,
"
dead
?
dead
?
"
says
he
,
and
suddenly
cast
his
bloody
sword
upon
the
ground
.
"
what
must
we
do
?
"
said
i
.
"
be
yourself
,
sir
.
it
is
too
late
now
:
you
must
be
yourself
.
"
he
turned
and
stared
at
me
.
"
oh
,
mackellar
!
"
says
he
,
and
put
his
face
in
his
hands
.
i
plucked
him
by
the
coat
.
"
for
god
'
s
sake
,
for
all
our
sakes
,
be
more
courageous
!
"
said
i
.
"
what
must
we
do
?
"
he
showed
me
his
face
with
the
same
stupid
stare
.
"
do
?
"
says
he
.
and
with
that
his
eye
fell
on
the
body
,
and
"
oh
!
"
he
cries
out
,
with
his
hand
to
his
brow
,
as
if
he
had
never
remembered
;
and
,
turning
from
me
,
made
off
towards
the
house
of
durrisdeer
at
a
strange
stumbling
run
.
i
stood
a
moment
mused
;
then
it
seemed
to
me
my
duty
lay
most
plain
on
the
side
of
the
living
;
and
i
ran
after
him
,
leaving
the
candles
on
the
frosty
ground
and
the
body
lying
in
their
light
under
the
trees
.
but
run
as
i
pleased
,
he
had
the
start
of
me
,
and
was
got
into
the
house
,
and
up
to
the
hall
,
where
i
found
him
standing
before
the
fire
with
his
face
once
more
in
his
hands
,
and
as
he
so
stood
he
visibly
shuddered
.

,
mr
henry
,
"
i
said
,
"
this
will
be
the
ruin
of
us
all
.
"
"
what
is
this
that
i
have
done
?
"
cries
he
,
and
then
looking
upon
me
with
a
countenance
that
i
shall
never
forget
,
"
who
is
to
tell
the
old
man
?
"
he
said
.
the
word
knocked
at
my
heart
;
but
it
was
no
time
for
weakness
.
i
went
and
poured
him
out
a
glass
of
brandy
.
"
drink
that
,
"
said
i
,
"
drink
it
down
.
"
i
forced
him
to
swallow
it
like
a
child
;
and
,
being
still
perished
with
the
cold
of
the
night
,
i
followed
his
example
.
"
it
has
to
be
told
,
mackellar
,
"
said
he
.
"
it
must
be
told
.
"
and
he
fell
suddenly
in
a
seat
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
my
old
lord
'
s
seat
by
the
chimney
-
side
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
was
shaken
with
dry
sobs
.
dismay
came
upon
my
soul
;
it
was
plain
there
was
no
help
in
mr
henry
.
"
well
,
"
said
i
,
"
sit
there
,
and
leave
all
to
me
.
"
and
taking
a
candle
in
my
hand
,
i
set
forth
out
of
the
room
in
the
dark
house
.
there
was
no
movement
;
i
must
suppose
that
all
had
gone
unobserved
;
and
i
was
now
to
consider
how
to
smuggle
through
the
rest
with
the
like
secrecy
.
it
was
no
hour
for
scruples
;
and
i
opened
my
lady
'
s
door
without
so
much
as
a
knock
,
and
passed
boldly
in
.
"
there
is
some
calamity
happened
,
"
she
cried
,
sitting
up
in
bed
.
"
madam
,
"
said
i
,
"
i
will
go
forth
again
into
the
passage
;
and
do
you
get
as
quickly
as
you
can
into
your
clothes
.
there
is
much
to
be
done
.
"
she
troubled
me
with
no
questions
,
nor
did
she
keep
me
waiting
.
ere
i
had
time
to
prepare
a
word
of
that
which
i
must
say
to
her
,
she
was
on
the
threshold
signing
me
to
enter
.
"
madam
,
"
said
i
,
"
if
you
cannot
be
very
brave
,
i
must
go
elsewhere
;
for
if
no
one
helps
me
to
-
night
,
there
is
an
end
of
the
house
of
durrisdeer
.
"
"
i
am
very
courageous
,
"
said
she
;
and
she
looked
at
me
with
a
sort
of
smile
,
very
painful
to
see
,
but
very
brave
too
.
"
it
has
come
to
a
duel
,
"
said
i
.
"
a
duel
?
"
she
repeated
.
"
a
duel
!
henry
and
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
and
the
master
,
"
said
i
.
"
things
have
been
borne
so
long
,
things
of
which
you
know
nothing
,
which
you
would
not
believe
if
i
should
tell
.
but
to
-
night
it
went
too
far
,
and
when
he
insulted
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
stop
,
"
said
she
.
"
he
?
who
?
"
"
oh
!
madam
,
"
cried
i
,
my
bitterness
breaking
forth
,
"
do
you
ask
me
such
a
question
?
indeed
,
then
,
i
may
go
elsewhere
for
help
;
there
is
none
here
!
"
"
i
do
not
know
in
what
i
have
offended
you
,
"
said
she
.
"
forgive
me
;
put
me
out
of
this
suspense
.
"
but
i
dared
not
tell
her
yet
;
i
felt
not
sure
of
her
;
and
at
the
doubt
,
and
under
the
sense
of
impotence
it
brought
with
it
,
i
turned
on
the
poor
woman
with
something
near
to
anger
.
"
madam
,
"
said
i
,
"
we
are
speaking
of
two
men
:
one
of
them
insulted
you
,
and
you
ask
me
which
.
i
will
help
you
to
the
answer
.
with
one
of
these
men
you
have
spent
all
your
hours
:
has
the
other
reproached
you
?
to
one
you
have
been
always
kind
;
to
the
other
,
as
god
sees
me
and
judges
between
us
two
,
i
think
not
always
:
has
his
love
ever
failed
you
?
to
-
night
one
of
these
two
men
told
the
other
,
in
my
hearing
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
hearing
of
a
hired
stranger
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
you
were
in
love
with
him
.
before
i
say
one
word
,
you
shall
answer
your
own
question
:
which
was
it
?
nay
,
madam
,
you
shall
answer
me
another
:
if
it
has
come
to
this
dreadful
end
,
whose
fault
is
it
?
"
she
stared
at
me
like
one
dazzled
.
"
good
god
!
"
she
said
once
,
in
a
kind
of
bursting
exclamation
;
and
then
a
second
time
in
a
whisper
to
herself
:
"
great
god
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
the
name
of
mercy
,
mackellar
,
what
is
wrong
?
"
she
cried
.
"
i
am
made
up
;
i
can
hear
all
.
"
"
you
are
not
fit
to
hear
,
"
said
i
.
"
whatever
it
was
,
you
shall
say
first
it
was
your
fault
.
"
"
oh
!
"
she
cried
,
with
a
gesture
of
wringing
her
hands
,
"
this
man
will
drive
me
mad
!
can
you
not
put
me
out
of
your
thoughts
?
"
"
i
think
not
once
of
you
,
"
i
cried
.
"
i
think
of
none
but
my
dear
unhappy
master
.
"
"
ah
!
"
she
cried
,
with
her
hand
to
her
heart
,
"
is
henry
dead
?
"
"
lower
your
voice
,
"
said
i
.
"
the
other
.
"
i
saw
her
sway
like
something
stricken
by
the
wind
;
and
i
know
not
whether
in
cowardice
or
misery
,
turned
aside
and
looked
upon
the
floor
.
"
these
are
dreadful
tidings
,
"
said
i
at
length
,
when
her
silence
began
to
put
me
in
some
fear
;
"
and
you
and
i
behove
to
be
the
more
bold
if
the
house
is
to
be
saved
.
"
still
she
answered
nothing
.
"
there
is
miss
katharine
,
besides
,
"
i
added
:
"
unless
we
bring
this
matter
through
,
her
inheritance
is
like
to
be
of
shame
.
"
i
do
not
know
if
it
was
the
thought
of
her
child
or
the
naked
word
shame
,
that
gave
her
deliverance
;
at
least
,
i
had
no
sooner
spoken
than
a
sound
passed
her
lips
,
the
like
of
it
i
never
heard
;
it
was
as
though
she
had
lain
buried
under
a
hill
and
sought
to
move
that
burthen
.
and
the
next
moment
she
had
found
a
sort
of
voice
.
"
it
was
a
fight
,
"
she
whispered
.
"
it
was
not
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
and
she
paused
upon
the
word
.
"
it
was
a
fair
fight
on
my
dear
master
'
s
part
,
"
said
i
.
"
as
for
the
other
,
he
was
slain
in
the
very
act
of
a
foul
stroke
.
"
"
not
now
!
"
she
cried
.
"
madam
,
"
said
i
,
"
hatred
of
that
man
glows
in
my
bosom
like
a
burning
fire
;
ay
,
even
now
he
is
dead
.
god
knows
,
i
would
have
stopped
the
fighting
,
had
i
dared
.
it
is
my
shame
i
did
not
.
but
when
i
saw
him
fall
,
if
i
could
have
spared
one
thought
from
pitying
of
my
master
,
it
had
been
to
exult
in
that
deliverance
.
"
i
do
not
know
if
she
marked
;
but
her
next
words
were
,
"
my
lord
?
"
"
that
shall
be
my
part
,
"
said
i
.
"
you
will
not
speak
to
him
as
you
have
to
me
?
"
she
asked
.
"
madam
,
"
said
i
,
"
have
you
not
some
one
else
to
think
of
?
leave
my
lord
to
me
.
"
"
some
one
else
?
"
she
repeated
.
"
your
husband
,
"
said
i
.
she
looked
at
me
with
a
countenance
illegible
.
"
are
you
going
to
turn
your
back
on
him
?
"
i
asked
.
still
she
looked
at
me
;
then
her
hand
went
to
her
heart
again
.
"
no
,
"
said
she
.
"
god
bless
you
for
that
word
!
"
i
said
.
"
go
to
him
now
,
where
he
sits
in
the
hall
;
speak
to
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
it
matters
not
what
you
say
;
give
him
your
hand
;
say
,
'
i
know
all
;
'
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
if
god
gives
you
grace
enough
,
say
,
'
forgive
me
.
'
"
"
god
strengthen
you
,
and
make
you
merciful
,
"
said
she
.
"
i
will
go
to
my
husband
.
"
"
let
me
light
you
there
,
"
said
i
,
taking
up
the
candle
.
"
i
will
find
my
way
in
the
dark
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
shudder
,
and
i
think
the
shudder
was
at
me
.
so
we
separated
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
she
down
stairs
to
where
a
little
light
glimmered
in
the
hall
-
door
,
i
along
the
passage
to
my
lord
'
s
room
.
it
seems
hard
to
say
why
,
but
i
could
not
burst
in
on
the
old
man
as
i
could
on
the
young
woman
;
with
whatever
reluctance
,
i
must
knock
.
but
his
old
slumbers
were
light
,
or
perhaps
he
slept
not
;
and
at
the
first
summons
i
was
bidden
enter
.
he
,
too
,
sat
up
in
bed
;
very
aged
and
bloodless
he
looked
;
and
whereas
he
had
a
certain
largeness
of
appearance
when
dressed
for
daylight
,
he
now
seemed
frail
and
little
,
and
his
face
(
the
wig
being
laid
aside
)
not
bigger
than
a
child
'
s
.
this
daunted
me
;
nor
less
,
the
haggard
surmise
of
misfortune
in
his
eye
.
yet
his
voice
was
even
peaceful
as
he
inquired
my
errand
.
i
set
my
candle
down
upon
a
chair
,
leaned
on
the
bed
-
foot
,
and
looked
at
him
.
"
lord
durrisdeer
,
"
said
i
,
"
it
is
very
well
known
to
you
that
i
am
a
partisan
in
your
family
.
"
"
i
hope
we
are
none
of
us
partisans
,
"
said
he
.
"
that
you
love
my
son
sincerely
,
i
have
always
been
glad
to
recognise
.
"
"
oh
!
my
lord
,
we
are
past
the
hour
of
these
civilities
,
"
i
replied
.
"
if
we
are
to
save
anything
out
of
the
fire
,
we
must
look
the
fact
in
its
bare
countenance
.
a
partisan
i
am
;
partisans
we
have
all
been
;
it
is
as
a
partisan
that
i
am
here
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
plead
before
you
.
hear
me
;
before
i
go
,
i
will
tell
you
why
.
"
"
i
would
always
hear
you
,
mr
mackellar
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
that
at
any
hour
,
whether
of
the
day
or
night
,
for
i
would
be
always
sure
you
had
a
reason
.
you
spoke
once
before
to
very
proper
purpose
;
i
have
not
forgotten
that
.
"
"
i
am
here
to
plead
the
cause
of
my
master
,
"
i
said
.
"
i
need
not
tell
you
how
he
acts
.
you
know
how
he
is
placed
.
you
know
with
what
generosity
,
he
has
always
met
your
other
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
met
your
wishes
,
"
i
corrected
myself
,
stumbling
at
that
name
of
son
.
"
you
know
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
must
know
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
what
he
has
suffered
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
what
he
has
suffered
about
his
wife
.
"
"
mr
.
mackellar
!
"
cried
my
lord
,
rising
in
bed
like
a
bearded
lion
.
"
you
said
you
would
hear
me
,
"
i
continued
.
"
what
you
do
not
know
,
what
you
should
know
,
one
of
the
things
i
am
here
to
speak
of
,
is
the
persecution
he
must
bear
in
private
.
your
back
is
not
turned
before
one
whom
i
dare
not
name
to
you
falls
upon
him
with
the
most
unfeeling
taunts
;
twits
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
pardon
me
,
my
lord
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
twits
him
with
your
partiality
,
calls
him
jacob
,
calls
him
clown
,
pursues
him
with
ungenerous
raillery
,
not
to
be
borne
by
man
.
and
let
but
one
of
you
appear
,
instantly
he
changes
;
and
my
master
must
smile
and
courtesy
to
the
man
who
has
been
feeding
him
with
insults
;
i
know
,
for
i
have
shared
in
some
of
it
,
and
i
tell
you
the
life
is
insupportable
.
all
these
months
it
has
endured
;
it
began
with
the
man
'
s
landing
;
it
was
by
the
name
of
jacob
that
my
master
was
greeted
the
first
night
.
"
my
lord
made
a
movement
as
if
to
throw
aside
the
clothes
and
rise
.
"
if
there
be
any
truth
in
this
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
said
he
.
"
do
i
look
like
a
man
lying
?
"
i
interrupted
,
checking
him
with
my
hand
.
"
you
should
have
told
me
at
first
,
"
he
odd
.
"
ah
,
my
lord
!
indeed
i
should
,
and
you
may
well
hate
the
face
of
this
unfaithful
servant
!
"
i
cried
.
"
i
will
take
order
,
"
said
he
,
"
at
once
.
"
and
again
made
the
movement
to
rise
.
again
i
checked
him
.
"
i
have
not
done
,
"
said
i
.
"
would
god
i
had
!
all
this
my
dear
,
unfortunate
patron
has
endured
without
help
or
countenance
.
your
own
best
word
,
my
lord
,
was
only
gratitude
.
oh
,
but
he
was
your
son
,
too
!
he
had
no
other
father
.
he
was
hated
in
the
country
,
god
knows
how
unjustly
.
he
had
a
loveless
marriage
.
he
stood
on
all
hands
without
affection
or
support
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
dear
,
generous
,
ill
-
fated

noble
heart
!
"
"
your
tears
do
you
much
honour
and
me
much
shame
,
"
says
my
lord
,
with
a
palsied
trembling
.
"
but
you
do
me
some
injustice
.
henry
has
been
ever
dear
to
me
,
very
dear
.
james
(
i
do
not
deny
it
,
mr
mackellar
)
,
james
is
perhaps
dearer
;
you
have
not
seen
my
james
in
quite
a
favourable
light
;
he
has
suffered
under
his
misfortunes
;
and
we
can
only
remember
how
great
and
how
unmerited
these
were
.
and
even
now
his
is
the
more
affectionate
nature
.
but
i
will
not
speak
of
him
.
all
that
you
say
of
henry
is
most
true
;
i
do
not
wonder
,
i
know
him
to
be
very
magnanimous
;
you
will
say
i
trade
upon
the
knowledge
?
it
is
possible
;
there
are
dangerous
virtues
:
virtues
that
tempt
the
encroacher
.
mr
mackellar
,
i
will
make
it
up
to
him
;
i
will
take
order
with
all
this
.
i
have
been
weak
;
and
,
what
is
worse
,
i
have
been
dull
!
"
"
i
must
not
hear
you
blame
yourself
,
my
lord
,
with
that
which
i
have
yet
to
tell
upon
my
conscience
,
"
i
replied
.
"
you
have
not
been
weak
;
you
have
been
abused
by
a
devilish
dissembler
.
you
saw
yourself
how
he
had
deceived
you
in
the
matter
of
his
danger
;
he
has
deceived
you
throughout
in
every
step
of
his
career
.
i
wish
to
pluck
him
from
your
heart
;
i
wish
to
force
your
eyes
upon
your
other
son
;
ah
,
you
have
a
son
there
!
"
"
no
,
no
"
said
he
,
"
two
sons
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
have
two
sons
.
"
i
made
some
gesture
of
despair
that
struck
him
;
he
looked
at
me
with
a
changed
face
.
"
there
is
much
worse
behind
?
"
he
asked
,
his
voice
dying
as
it
rose
upon
the
question
.
"
much
worse
,
"
i
answered
.
"
this
night
he
said
these
words
to
mr
henry
:
'
i
have
never
known
a
woman
who
did
not
prefer
me
to
you
,
and
i
think
who
did
not
continue
to
prefer
me
.
'
"
"
i
will
hear
nothing
against
my
daughter
,
"
he
cried
;
and
from
his
readiness
to
stop
me
in
this
direction
,
i
conclude
his
eyes
were
not
so
dull
as
i
had
fancied
,
and
he
had
looked
not
without
anxiety
upon
the
siege
of
mrs
henry
.
"
i
think
not
of
blaming
her
,
"
cried
i
.
"
it
is
not
that
.
these
words
were
said
in
my
hearing
to
mr
henry
;
and
if
you
find
them
not
yet
plain
enough
,
these
others
but
a
little
after
:
your
wife
,
who
is
in
love
with
me
!
'
"
"
they
have
quarrelled
?
"
he
said
.
i
nodded
.
"
i
must
fly
to
them
,
"
he
said
,
beginning
once
again
to
leave
his
bed
.
"
no
,
no
!
"
i
cried
,
holding
forth
my
hands
.
"
you
do
not
know
,
"
said
he
.
"
these
are
dangerous
words
.
"
"
will
nothing
make
you
understand
,
my
lord
?
'
said
i
.
his
eyes
besought
me
for
the
truth
.
i
flung
myself
on
my
knees
by
the
bedside
.
"
oh
,
my
lord
,
"
cried
i
,
"
think
on
him
you
have
left
;
think
of
this
poor
sinner
whom
you
begot
,
whom
your
wife
bore
to
you
,
whom
we
have
none
of
us
strengthened
as
we
could
;
think
of
him
,
not
of
yourself
;
he
is
the
other
sufferer
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
think
of
him
!
that
is
the
door
for
sorrow
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
christ
'
s
door
,
god
'
s
door
:
oh
!
it
stands
open
.
think
of
him
,
even
as
he
thought
of
you
.
'
who
is
to
tell
the
old
man
?
'
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
these
were
his
words
.
it
was
for
that
i
came
;
that
is
why
i
am
here
pleading
at
your
feet
.
"
"
let
me
get
up
,
"
he
cried
,
thrusting
me
aside
,
and
was
on
his
feet
before
myself
.
his
voice
shook
like
a
sail
in
the
wind
,
yet
he
spoke
with
a
good
loudness
;
his
face
was
like
the
snow
,
but
his
eyes
were
steady
and
dry
.
"
here
is
too
much
speech
,
"
said
he
.
"
where
was
it
?
"
"
in
the
shrubbery
,
"
said
i
.
"
and
mr
henry
?
"
he
asked
.
and
when
i
had
told
him
he
knotted
his
old
face
in
thought
.
"
and
mr
james
?
"
says
he
.
"
i
have
left
him
lying
,
"
said
i
,
"
beside
the
candles
.
"
"
candles
?
"
he
cried
.
and
with
that
he
ran
to
the
window
,
opened
it
,
and
looked
abroad
.
"
it
might
be
spied
from
the
road
.
"
"
where
none
goes
by
at
such
an
hour
,
"
i
objected
.
"
it
makes
no
matter
,
"
he
said
.
"
one
might
.
hark
!
"
cries
he
.
"
what
is
that
?
"
it
was
the
sound
of
men
very
guardedly
rowing
in
the
bay
;
and
i
told
him
so
.
"
the
freetraders
,
"
said
my
lord
.
"
run
at
once
,
mackellar
;
put
these
candles
out
.
i
will
dress
in
the
meanwhile
;
and
when
you
return
we
can
debate
on
what
is
wisest
.
"
i
groped
my
way
downstairs
,
and
out
at
the
door
.
from
quite
a
far
way
off
a
sheen
was
visible
,
making
points
of
brightness
in
the
shrubbery
;
in
so
black
a
night
it
might
have
been
remarked
for
miles
;
and
i
blamed
myself
bitterly
for
my
incaution
.
how
much
more
sharply
when
i
reached
the
place
!
one
of
the
candlesticks
was
overthrown
,
and
that
taper
quenched
.
the
other
burned
steadily
by
itself
,
and
made
a
broad
space
of
light
upon
the
frosted
ground
.
all
within
that
circle
seemed
,
by
the
force
of
contrast
and
the
overhanging
blackness
,
brighter
than
by
day
.
and
there
was
the
bloodstain
in
the
midst
;
and
a
little
farther
off
mr
henry
'
s
sword
,
the
pommel
of
which
was
of
silver
;
but
of
the
body
,
not
a
trace
.
my
heart
thumped
upon
my
ribs
,
the
hair
stirred
upon
my
scalp
,
as
i
stood
there
staring
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
so
strange
was
the
sight
,
so
dire
the
fears
it
wakened
.
i
looked
right
and
left
;
the
ground
was
so
hard
,
it
told
no
story
.
i
stood
and
listened
till
my
ears
ached
,
but
the
night
was
hollow
about
me
like
an
empty
church
;
not
even
a
ripple
stirred
upon
the
shore
;
it
seemed
you
might
have
heard
a
pin
drop
in
the
county
.
i
put
the
candle
out
,
and
the
blackness
fell
about
me
groping
dark
;
it
was
like
a
crowd
surrounding
me
;
and
i
went
back
to
the
house
of
durrisdeer
,
with
my
chin
upon
my
shoulder
,
startling
,
as
i
went
,
with
craven
suppositions
.
in
the
door
a
figure
moved
to
meet
me
,
and
i
had
near
screamed
with
terror
ere
i
recognised
mrs
henry
.
"
have
you
told
him
?
"
says
she
.
"
it
was
he
who
sent
me
,
"
said
i
.
"
it
is
gone
.
but
why
are
you
here
?
"
"
it
is
gone
!
"
she
repeated
.
"
what
is
gone
?
"
"
the
body
,
"
said
i
.
"
why
are
you
not
with
your
husband
?
"
"
gone
!
"
said
she
.
"
you
cannot
have
looked
.
come
back
.
"
"
there
is
no
light
now
,
"
said
i
.
"
i
dare
not
.
"
"
i
can
see
in
the
dark
.
i
have
been
standing
here
so
long
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
so
long
,
"
said
she
.
"
come
,
give
me
your
hand
.
"
we
returned
to
the
shrubbery
hand
in
hand
,
and
to
the
fatal
place
.
"
take
care
of
the
blood
,
"
said
i
.
"
blood
?
"
she
cried
,
and
started
violently
back
.
"
i
suppose
it
will
be
,
"
said
i
.
"
i
am
like
a
blind
man
.
"
"
no
!
"
said
she
,
"
nothing
!
have
you
not
dreamed
?
"
"
ah
,
would
to
god
we
had
!
"
cried
i
.
she
spied
the
sword
,
picked
it
up
,
and
seeing
the
blood
,
let
it
fall
again
with
her
hands
thrown
wide
.
"
ah
!
"
she
cried
.
and
then
,
with
an
instant
courage
,
handled
it
the
second
time
,
and
thrust
it
to
the
hilt
into
the
frozen
ground
.
"
i
will
take
it
back
and
clean
it
properly
,
"
says
she
,
and
again
looked
about
her
on
all
sides
.
"
it
cannot
be
that
he
was
dead
?
"
she
added
.
"
there
was
no
flutter
of
his
heart
,
"
said
i
,
and
then
remembering
:
"
why
are
you
not
with
your
husband
?
"
"
it
is
no
use
,
"
said
she
;
"
he
will
not
speak
to
me
.
"
"
not
speak
to
you
?
"
i
repeated
.
"
oh
!
you
have
not
tried
.
"
"
you
have
a
right
to
doubt
me
,
"
she
replied
,
with
a
gentle
dignity
.
at
this
,
for
the
first
time
,
i
was
seized
with
sorrow
for
her
.
"
god
knows
,
madam
,
"
i
cried
,
"
god
knows
i
am
not
so
hard
as
i
appear
;
on
this
dreadful
night
who
can
veneer
his
words
?
but
i
am
a
friend
to
all
who
are
not
henry
durie
'
s
enemies
.
"
"
it
is
hard
,
then
,
you
should
hesitate
about
his
wife
,
"
said
she
.
i
saw
all
at
once
,
like
the
rending
of
a
veil
,
how
nobly
she
had
borne
this
unnatural
calamity
,
and
how
generously
my
reproaches
.
"
we
must
go
back
and
tell
this
to
my
lord
,
"
said
i
.
"
him
i
cannot
face
,
"
she
cried
.
"
you
will
find
him
the
least
moved
of
all
of
us
,
"
said
i
.
"
and
yet
i
cannot
face
him
,
"
said
she
.
"
well
,
"
said
i
,
"
you
can
return
to
mr
henry
;
i
will
see
my
lord
.
"
as
we
walked
back
,
i
bearing
the
candlesticks
,
she
the
sword
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
strange
burthen
for
that
woman
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
she
had
another
thought
.
"
should
we
tell
henry
?
"
she
asked
.
"
let
my
lord
decide
,
"
said
i
.
my
lord
was
nearly
dressed
when
i
came
to
his
chamber
.
he
heard
me
with
a
frown
.
"
the
freetraders
,
"
said
he
.
"
but
whether
dead
or
alive
?
"
"
i
thought
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
said
i
,
and
paused
,
ashamed
of
the
word
.
"
i
know
;
but
you
may
very
well
have
been
in
error
.
why
should
they
remove
him
if
not
living
?
"
he
asked
.
"
oh
!
here
is
a
great
door
of
hope
.
it
must
be
given
out
that
he
departed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
he
came
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
without
any
note
of
preparation
.
we
must
save
all
scandal
.
"
i
saw
he
had
fallen
,
like
the
rest
of
us
,
to
think
mainly
of
the
house
.
now
that
all
the
living
members
of
the
family
were
plunged
in
irremediable
sorrow
,
it
was
strange
how
we
turned
to
that
conjoint
abstraction
of
the
family
itself
,
and
sought
to
bolster
up
the
airy
nothing
of
its
reputation
:
not
the
duries
only
,
but
the
hired
steward
himself
.
"
are
we
to
tell
mr
henry
?
"
i
asked
him
.
"
i
will
see
,
"
said
he
.
"
i
am
going
first
to
visit
him
;
then
i
go
forth
with
you
to
view
the
shrubbery
and
consider
.
"
we
went
downstairs
into
the
hall
.
mr
henry
sat
by
the
table
with
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
like
a
man
of
stone
.
his
wife
stood
a
little
back
from
him
,
her
hand
at
her
mouth
;
it
was
plain
she
could
not
move
him
.
my
old
lord
walked
very
steadily
to
where
his
son
was
sitting
;
he
had
a
steady
countenance
,
too
,
but
methought
a
little
cold
.
when
he
was
come
quite
up
,
he
held
out
both
his
hands
and
said
,
"
my
son
!
"
with
a
broken
,
strangled
cry
,
mr
henry
leaped
up
and
fell
on
his
father
'
s
neck
,
crying
and
weeping
,
the
most
pitiful
sight
that
ever
a
man
witnessed
.
"
oh
!
father
,
"
he
cried
,
"
you
know
i
loved
him
;
you
know
i
loved
him
in
the
beginning
;
i
could
have
died
for
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
know
that
!
i
would
have
given
my
life
for
him
and
you
.
oh
!
say
you
know
that
.
oh
!
say
you
can
forgive
me
.
o
father
,
father
,
what
have
i
done
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
what
have
i
done
?
and
we
used
to
be
bairns
together
!
"
and
wept
and
sobbed
,
and
fondled
the
old
man
,
and
clutched
him
about
the
neck
,
with
the
passion
of
a
child
in
terror
.
and
then
he
caught
sight
of
his
wife
(
you
would
have
thought
for
the
first
time
)
,
where
she
stood
weeping
to
hear
him
,
and
in
a
moment
had
fallen
at
her
knees
.
"
and
o
my
lass
,
"
he
cried
,
"
you
must
forgive
me
,
too
!
not
your
husband
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
have
only
been
the
ruin
of
your
life
.
but
you
knew
me
when
i
was
a
lad
;
there
was
no
harm
in
henry
durie
then
;
he
meant
aye
to
be
a
friend
to
you
.
it
is
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
it
is
the
old
bairn
that
played
with
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
oh
,
can
ye
never
,
never
forgive
him
?
"
throughout
all
this
my
lord
was
like
a
cold
,
kind
spectator
with
his
wits
about
him
.
at
the
first
cry
,
which
was
indeed
enough
to
call
the
house
about
us
,
he
had
said
to
me
over
his
shoulder
,
"
close
the
door
.
"
and
now
he
nodded
to
himself
.
"
we
may
leave
him
to
his
wife
now
,
"
'
says
he
.
"
bring
a
light
,
mr
mackellar
.
"
upon
my
going
forth
again
with
my
lord
,
i
was
aware
of
a
strange
phenomenon
;
for
though
it
was
quite
dark
,
and
the
night
not
yet
old
,
methought
i
smelt
the
morning
.
at
the
same
time
there
went
a
tossing
through
the
branches
of
the
evergreens
,
so
that
they
sounded
like
a
quiet
sea
,
and
the
air
pulled
at
times
against
our
faces
,
and
the
flame
of
the
candle
shook
.
we
made
the
more
speed
,
i
believe
,
being
surrounded
by
this
bustle
;
visited
the
scene
of
the
duel
,
where
my
lord
looked
upon
the
blood
with
stoicism
;
and
passing
farther
on
toward
the
landing
-
place
,
came
at
last
upon
some
evidences
of
the
truth
.
for
,
first
of
all
,
where
there
was
a
pool
across
the
path
,
the
ice
had
been
trodden
in
,
plainly
by
more
than
one
man
'
s
weight
;
next
,
and
but
a
little
farther
,
a
young
tree
was
broken
,
and
down
by
the
landing
-
place
,
where
the
traders
'
boats
were
usually
beached
,
another
stain
of
blood
marked
where
the
body
must
have
been
infallibly
set
down
to
rest
the
bearers
.
this
stain
we
set
ourselves
to
wash
away
with
the
sea
-
water
,
carrying
it
in
my
lord
'
s
hat
;
and
as
we
were
thus
engaged
there
came
up
a
sudden
moaning
gust
and
left
us
instantly
benighted
.
"
it
will
come
to
snow
,
"
says
my
lord
;
"
and
the
best
thing
that
we
could
hope
.
let
us
go
back
now
;
we
can
do
nothing
in
the
dark
.
"
as
we
went
houseward
,
the
wind
being
again
subsided
,
we
were
aware
of
a
strong
pattering
noise
about
us
in
the
night
;
and
when
we
issued
from
the
shelter
of
the
trees
,
we
found
it
raining
smartly
.
throughout
the
whole
of
this
,
my
lord
'
s
clearness
of
mind
,
no
less
than
his
activity
of
body
,
had
not
ceased
to
minister
to
my
amazement
.
he
set
the
crown
upon
it
in
the
council
we
held
on
our
return
.
the
freetraders
had
certainly
secured
the
master
,
though
whether
dead
or
alive
we
were
still
left
to
our
conjectures
;
the
rain
would
,
long
before
day
,
wipe
out
all
marks
of
the
transaction
;
by
this
we
must
profit
.
the
master
had
unexpectedly
come
after
the
fall
of
night
;
it
must
now
he
given
out
he
had
as
suddenly
departed
before
the
break
of
day
;
and
,
to
make
all
this
plausible
,
it
now
only
remained
for
me
to
mount
into
the
man
'
s
chamber
,
and
pack
and
conceal
his
baggage
.
true
,
we
still
lay
at
the
discretion
of
the
traders
;
but
that
was
the
incurable
weakness
of
our
guilt
.
i
heard
him
,
as
i
said
,
with
wonder
,
and
hastened
to
obey
.
mr
and
mrs
henry
were
gone
from
the
hall
;
my
lord
,
for
warmth
'
s
sake
,
hurried
to
his
bed
;
there
was
still
no
sign
of
stir
among
the
servants
,
and
as
i
went
up
the
tower
stair
,
and
entered
the
dead
man
'
s
room
,
a
horror
of
solitude
weighed
upon
my
mind
.
to
my
extreme
surprise
,
it
was
all
in
the
disorder
of
departure
.
of
his
three
portmanteaux
,
two
were
already
locked
;
the
third
lay
open
and
near
full
.
at
once
there
flashed
upon
me
some
suspicion
of
the
truth
.
the
man
had
been
going
,
after
all
;
he
had
but
waited
upon
crail
,
as
crail
waited
upon
the
wind
;
early
in
the
night
the
seamen
had
perceived
the
weather
changing
;
the
boat
had
come
to
give
notice
of
the
change
and
call
the
passenger
aboard
,
and
the
boat
'
s
crew
had
stumbled
on
him
dying
in
his
blood
.
nay
,
and
there
was
more
behind
.
this
pre
-
arranged
departure
shed
some
light
upon
his
inconceivable
insult
of
the
night
before
;
it
was
a
parting
shot
,
hatred
being
no
longer
checked
by
policy
.
and
,
for
another
thing
,
the
nature
of
that
insult
,
and
the
conduct
of
mrs
henry
,
pointed
to
one
conclusion
,
which
i
have
never
verified
,
and
can
now
never
verify
until
the
great
assize
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
conclusion
that
he
had
at
last
forgotten
himself
,
had
gone
too
far
in
his
advances
,
and
had
been
rebuffed
.
it
can
never
be
verified
,
as
i
say
;
but
as
i
thought
of
it
that
morning
among
his
baggage
,
the
thought
was
sweet
to
me
like
honey
.
into
the
open
portmanteau
i
dipped
a
little
ere
i
closed
it
.
the
most
beautiful
lace
and
linen
,
many
suits
of
those
fine
plain
clothes
in
which
he
loved
to
appear
;
a
book
or
two
,
and
those
of
the
best
,
caesar
'
s
"
commentaries
,
"
a
volume
of
mr
hobbes
,
the
"
henriade
"
of
m
.
de
voltaire
,
a
book
upon
the
indies
,
one
on
the
mathematics
,
far
beyond
where
i
have
studied
:
these
were
what
i
observed
with
very
mingled
feelings
.
but
in
the
open
portmanteau
,
no
papers
of
any
description
.
this
set
me
musing
.
it
was
possible
the
man
was
dead
;
but
,
since
the
traders
had
carried
him
away
,
not
likely
.
it
was
possible
he
might
still
die
of
his
wound
;
but
it
was
also
possible
he
might
not
.
and
in
this
latter
case
i
was
determined
to
have
the
means
of
some
defence
.
one
after
another
i
carried
his
portmanteaux
to
a
loft
in
the
top
of
the
house
which
we
kept
locked
;
went
to
my
own
room
for
my
keys
,
and
,
returning
to
the
loft
,
had
the
gratification
to
find
two
that
fitted
pretty
well
.
in
one
of
the
portmanteaux
there
was
a
shagreen
letter
-
case
,
which
i
cut
open
with
my
knife
;
and
thenceforth
(
so
far
as
any
credit
went
)
the
man
was
at
my
mercy
.
here
was
a
vast
deal
of
gallant
correspondence
,
chiefly
of
his
paris
days
;
and
,
what
was
more
to
the
purpose
,
here
were
the
copies
of
his
own
reports
to
the
english
secretary
,
and
the
originals
of
the
secretary
'
s
answers
:
a
most
damning
series
:
such
as
to
publish
would
be
to
wreck
the
master
'
s
honour
and
to
set
a
price
upon
his
life
.
i
chuckled
to
myself
as
i
ran
through
the
documents
;
i
rubbed
my
hands
,
i
sang
aloud
in
my
glee
.
day
found
me
at
the
pleasing
task
;
nor
did
i
then
remit
my
diligence
,
except
in
so
far
as
i
went
to
the
window
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
looked
out
for
a
moment
,
to
see
the
frost
quite
gone
,
the
world
turned
black
again
,
and
the
rain
and
the
wind
driving
in
the
bay
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
to
assure
myself
that
the
lugger
was
gone
from
its
anchorage
,
and
the
master
(
whether
dead
or
alive
)
now
tumbling
on
the
irish
sea
.
it
is
proper
i
should
add
in
this
place
the
very
little
i
have
subsequently
angled
out
upon
the
doings
of
that
night
.
it
took
me
a
long
while
to
gather
it
;
for
we
dared
not
openly
ask
,
and
the
freetraders
regarded
me
with
enmity
,
if
not
with
scorn
.
it
was
near
six
months
before
we
even
knew
for
certain
that
the
man
survived
;
and
it
was
years
before
i
learned
from
one
of
crail
'
s
men
,
turned
publican
on
his
ill
-
gotten
gain
,
some
particulars
which
smack
to
me
of
truth
.
it
seems
the
traders
found
the
master
struggled
on
one
elbow
,
and
now
staring
round
him
,
and
now
gazing
at
the
candle
or
at
his
hand
which
was
all
bloodied
,
like
a
man
stupid
.
upon
their
coming
,
he
would
seem
to
have
found
his
mind
,
bade
them
carry
him
aboard
,
and
hold
their
tongues
;
and
on
the
captain
asking
how
he
had
come
in
such
a
pickle
,
replied
with
a
burst
of
passionate
swearing
,
and
incontinently
fainted
.
they
held
some
debate
,
but
they
were
momently
looking
for
a
wind
,
they
were
highly
paid
to
smuggle
him
to
france
,
and
did
not
care
to
delay
.
besides
which
,
he
was
well
enough
liked
by
these
abominable
wretches
:
they
supposed
him
under
capital
sentence
,
knew
not
in
what
mischief
he
might
have
got
his
wound
,
and
judged
it
a
piece
of
good
nature
to
remove
him
out
of
the
way
of
danger
.
so
he
was
taken
aboard
,
recovered
on
the
passage
over
,
and
was
set
ashore
a
convalescent
at
the
havre
de
grace
.
what
is
truly
notable
:
he
said
not
a
word
to
anyone
of
the
duel
,
and
not
a
trader
knows
to
this
day
in
what
quarrel
,
or
by
the
hand
of
what
adversary
,
he
fell
.
with
any
other
man
i
should
have
set
this
down
to
natural
decency
;
with
him
,
to
pride
.
he
could
not
bear
to
avow
,
perhaps
even
to
himself
,
that
he
had
been
vanquished
by
one
whom
he
had
so
much
insulted
whom
he
so
cruelly
despised
.
of
the
heavy
sickness
which
declared
itself
next
morning
i
can
think
with
equanimity
,
as
of
the
last
unmingled
trouble
that
befell
my
master
;
and
even
that
was
perhaps
a
mercy
in
disguise
;
for
what
pains
of
the
body
could
equal
the
miseries
of
his
mind
?
mrs
henry
and
i
had
the
watching
by
the
bed
.
my
old
lord
called
from
time
to
time
to
take
the
news
,
but
would
not
usually
pass
the
door
.
once
,
i
remember
,
when
hope
was
nigh
gone
,
he
stepped
to
the
bedside
,
looked
awhile
in
his
son
'
s
face
,
and
turned
away
with
a
gesture
of
the
head
and
hand
thrown
up
,
that
remains
upon
my
mind
as
something
tragic
;
such
grief
and
such
a
scorn
of
sublunary
things
were
there
expressed
.
but
the
most
of
the
time
mrs
henry
and
i
had
the
room
to
ourselves
,
taking
turns
by
night
,
and
bearing
each
other
company
by
day
,
for
it
was
dreary
watching
.
mr
henry
,
his
shaven
head
bound
in
a
napkin
,
tossed
fro
without
remission
,
beating
the
bed
with
his
hands
.
his
tongue
never
lay
;
his
voice
ran
continuously
like
a
river
,
so
that
my
heart
was
weary
with
the
sound
of
it
.
it
was
notable
,
and
to
me
inexpressibly
mortifying
,
that
he
spoke
all
the
while
on
matters
of
no
import
:
comings
and
goings
,
horses
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
which
he
was
ever
calling
to
have
saddled
,
thinking
perhaps
(
the
poor
soul
!
)
that
he
might
ride
away
from
his
discomfort
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
matters
of
the
garden
,
the
salmon
nets
,
and
(
what
i
particularly
raged
to
hear
)
continually
of
his
affairs
,
cyphering
figures
and
holding
disputation
with
the
tenantry
.
never
a
word
of
his
father
or
his
wife
,
nor
of
the
master
,
save
only
for
a
day
or
two
,
when
his
mind
dwelled
entirely
in
the
past
,
and
he
supposed
himself
a
boy
again
and
upon
some
innocent
child
'
s
play
with
his
brother
.
what
made
this
the
more
affecting
:
it
appeared
the
master
had
then
run
some
peril
of
his
life
,
for
there
was
a
cry
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
oh
!
jamie
will
be
drowned
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
oh
,
save
jamie
!
"
which
he
came
over
and
over
with
a
great
deal
of
passion
.
this
,
i
say
,
was
affecting
,
both
to
mrs
henry
and
myself
;
but
the
balance
of
my
master
'
s
wanderings
did
him
little
justice
.
it
seemed
he
had
set
out
to
justify
his
brother
'
s
calumnies
;
as
though
he
was
bent
to
prove
himself
a
man
of
a
dry
nature
,
immersed
in
money
-
getting
.
had
i
been
there
alone
,
i
would
not
have
troubled
my
thumb
;
but
all
the
while
,
as
i
listened
,
i
was
estimating
the
effect
on
the
man
'
s
wife
,
and
telling
myself
that
he
fell
lower
every
day
.
i
was
the
one
person
on
the
surface
of
the
globe
that
comprehended
him
,
and
i
was
bound
there
should
be
yet
another
.
whether
he
was
to
die
there
and
his
virtues
perish
:
or
whether
he
should
save
his
days
and
come
back
to
that
inheritance
of
sorrows
,
his
right
memory
:
i
was
bound
he
should
be
heartily
lamented
in
the
one
case
,
and
unaffectedly
welcomed
in
the
other
,
by
the
person
he
loved
the
most
,
his
wife
.
finding
no
occasion
of
free
speech
,
i
bethought
me
at
last
of
a
kind
of
documentary
disclosure
;
and
for
some
nights
,
when
i
was
off
duty
and
should
have
been
asleep
,
i
gave
my
time
to
the
preparation
of
that
which
i
may
call
my
budget
.
but
this
i
found
to
be
the
easiest
portion
of
my
task
,
and
that
which
remained
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
namely
,
the
presentation
to
my
lady
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
almost
more
than
i
had
fortitude
to
overtake
.
several
days
i
went
about
with
my
papers
under
my
arm
,
spying
for
some
juncture
of
talk
to
serve
as
introduction
.
i
will
not
deny
but
that
some
offered
;
only
when
they
did
my
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
;
and
i
think
i
might
have
been
carrying
about
my
packet
till
this
day
,
had
not
a
fortunate
accident
delivered
me
from
all
my
hesitations
.
this
was
at
night
,
when
i
was
once
more
leaving
the
room
,
the
thing
not
yet
done
,
and
myself
in
despair
at
my
own
cowardice
.
"
what
do
you
carry
about
with
you
,
mr
mackellar
?
"
she
asked
.
"
these
last
days
,
i
see
you
always
coming
in
and
out
with
the
same
armful
.
"
i
returned
upon
my
steps
without
a
word
,
laid
the
papers
before
her
on
the
table
,
and
left
her
to
her
reading
.
of
what
that
was
,
i
am
now
to
give
you
some
idea
;
and
the
best
will
be
to
reproduce
a
letter
of
my
own
which
came
first
in
the
budget
and
of
which
(
according
to
an
excellent
habitude
)
i
have
preserved
the
scroll
.
it
will
show
,
too
,
the
moderation
of
my
part
in
these
affairs
,
a
thing
which
some
have
called
recklessly
in
question
.

weary
as
i
was
with
watching
and
distress
of
mind
,
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
sleep
.
all
night
long
i
walked
in
my
chamber
,
revolving
what
should
be
the
issue
,
and
sometimes
repenting
the
temerity
of
my
immixture
in
affairs
so
private
;
and
with
the
first
peep
of
the
morning
i
was
at
the
sick
-
room
door
.
mrs
henry
had
thrown
open
the
shutters
and
even
the
window
,
for
the
temperature
was
mild
.
she
looked
steadfastly
before
her
;
where
was
nothing
to
see
,
or
only
the
blue
of
the
morning
creeping
among
woods
.
upon
the
stir
of
my
entrance
she
did
not
so
much
as
turn
about
her
face
:
a
circumstance
from
which
i
augured
very
ill
.
"
madam
,
"
i
began
;
and
then
again
,
"
madam
;
"
but
could
make
no
more
of
it
.
nor
yet
did
mrs
henry
come
to
my
assistance
with
a
word
.
in
this
pass
i
began
gathering
up
the
papers
where
they
lay
scattered
on
the
table
;
and
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
,
their
bulk
appeared
to
have
diminished
.
once
i
ran
them
through
,
and
twice
;
but
the
correspondence
with
the
secretary
of
state
,
on
which
i
had
reckoned
so
much
against
the
future
,
was
nowhere
to
be
found
.
i
looked
in
the
chimney
;
amid
the
smouldering
embers
,
black
ashes
of
paper
fluttered
in
the
draught
;
and
at
that
my
timidity
vanished
.
"
good
god
,
madam
,
"
cried
i
,
in
a
voice
not
fitting
for
a
sick
-
room
,
"
good
god
,
madam
,
what
have
you
done
with
my
papers
?
"
"
i
have
burned
them
,
"
said
mrs
henry
,
turning
about
.
"
it
is
enough
,
it
is
too
much
,
that
you
and
i
have
seen
them
.
"
"
this
is
a
fine
night
'
s
work
that
you
have
done
!
"
cried
i
.
"
and
all
to
save
the
reputation
of
a
man
that
ate
bread
by
the
shedding
of
his
comrades
'
blood
,
as
i
do
by
the
shedding
of
ink
.
"
"
to
save
the
reputation
of
that
family
in
which
you
are
a
servant
,
mr
mackellar
,
"
she
returned
,
"
and
for
which
you
have
already
done
so
much
.
"
"
it
is
a
family
i
will
not
serve
much
longer
,
"
i
cried
,
"
for
i
am
driven
desperate
.
you
have
stricken
the
sword
out
of
my
hands
;
you
have
left
us
all
defenceless
.
i
had
always
these
letters
i
could
shake
over
his
head
;
and
now
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
what
is
to
do
?
we
are
so
falsely
situate
we
dare
not
show
the
man
the
door
;
the
country
would
fly
on
fire
against
us
;
and
i
had
this
one
hold
upon
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
now
it
is
gone
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
now
he
may
come
back
to
-
morrow
,
and
we
must
all
sit
down
with
him
to
dinner
,
go
for
a
stroll
with
him
on
the
terrace
,
or
take
a
hand
at
cards
,
of
all
things
,
to
divert
his
leisure
!
no
,
madam
!
god
forgive
you
,
if
he
can
find
it
in
his
heart
;
for
i
cannot
find
it
in
mine
.
"
"
i
wonder
to
find
you
so
simple
,
mr
mackellar
,
"
said
mrs
henry
.
"
what
does
this
man
value
reputation
?
but
he
knows
how
high
we
prize
it
;
he
knows
we
would
rather
die
than
make
these
letters
public
;
and
do
you
suppose
he
would
not
trade
upon
the
knowledge
?
what
you
call
your
sword
,
mr
mackellar
,
and
which
had
been
one
indeed
against
a
man
of
any
remnant
of
propriety
,
would
have
been
but
a
sword
of
paper
against
him
.
he
would
smile
in
your
face
at
such
a
threat
.
he
stands
upon
his
degradation
,
he
makes
that
his
strength
;
it
is
in
vain
to
struggle
with
such
characters
.
"
she
cried
out
this
last
a
little
desperately
,
and
then
with
more
quiet
:
"
no
,
mr
mackellar
;
i
have
thought
upon
this
matter
all
night
,
and
there
is
no
way
out
of
it
.
papers
or
no
papers
,
the
door
of
this
house
stands
open
for
him
;
he
is
the
rightful
heir
,
forsooth
!
if
we
sought
to
exclude
him
,
all
would
redound
against
poor
henry
,
and
i
should
see
him
stoned
again
upon
the
streets
.
ah
!
if
henry
dies
,
it
is
a
different
matter
!
they
have
broke
the
entail
for
their
own
good
purposes
;
the
estate
goes
to
my
daughter
;
and
i
shall
see
who
sets
a
foot
upon
it
.
but
if
henry
lives
,
my
poor
mr
mackellar
,
and
that
man
returns
,
we
must
suffer
:
only
this
time
it
will
be
together
.
"
on
the
whole
i
was
well
pleased
with
mrs
henry
'
s
attitude
of
mind
;
nor
could
i
even
deny
there
was
some
cogency
in
that
which
she
advanced
about
the
papers
.
"
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
,
"
said
i
.
"
i
can
only
be
sorry
i
trusted
a
lady
with
the
originals
,
which
was
an
unbusinesslike
proceeding
at
the
best
.
as
for
what
i
said
of
leaving
the
service
of
the
family
,
it
was
spoken
with
the
tongue
only
;
and
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
.
i
belong
to
durrisdeer
,
mrs
henry
,
as
if
i
had
been
born
there
.
"
i
must
do
her
the
justice
to
say
she
seemed
perfectly
relieved
;
so
that
we
began
this
morning
,
as
we
were
to
continue
for
so
many
years
,
on
a
proper
ground
of
mutual
indulgence
and
respect
.
the
same
day
,
which
was
certainly
prededicate
to
joy
,
we
observed
the
first
signal
of
recovery
in
mr
henry
;
and
about
three
of
the
following
afternoon
he
found
his
mind
again
,
recognising
me
by
name
with
the
strongest
evidences
of
affection
.
mrs
henry
was
also
in
the
room
,
at
the
bedfoot
;
but
it
did
not
appear
that
he
observed
her
.
and
indeed
(
the
fever
being
gone
)
he
was
so
weak
that
he
made
but
the
one
effort
and
sank
again
into
lethargy
.
the
course
of
his
restoration
was
now
slow
but
equal
;
every
day
his
appetite
improved
;
every
week
we
were
able
to
remark
an
increase
both
of
strength
and
flesh
;
and
before
the
end
of
the
month
he
was
out
of
bed
and
had
even
begun
to
be
carried
in
his
chair
upon
the
terrace
.
it
was
perhaps
at
this
time
that
mrs
henry
and
i
were
the
most
uneasy
in
mind
.
apprehension
for
his
days
was
at
an
end
;
and
a
worse
fear
succeeded
.
every
day
we
drew
consciously
nearer
to
a
day
of
reckoning
;
and
the
days
passed
on
,
and
still
there
was
nothing
.
mr
henry
bettered
in
strength
,
he
held
long
talks
with
us
on
a
great
diversity
of
subjects
,
his
father
came
and
sat
with
him
and
went
again
;
and
still
there
was
no
reference
to
the
late
tragedy
or
to
the
former
troubles
which
had
brought
it
on
.
did
he
remember
,
and
conceal
his
dreadful
knowledge
?
or
was
the
whole
blotted
from
his
mind
?
this
was
the
problem
that
kept
us
watching
and
trembling
all
day
when
we
were
in
his
company
and
held
us
awake
at
night
when
we
were
in
our
lonely
beds
.
we
knew
not
even
which
alternative
to
hope
for
,
both
appearing
so
unnatural
and
pointing
so
directly
to
an
unsound
brain
.
once
this
fear
offered
,
i
observed
his
conduct
with
sedulous
particularity
.
something
of
the
child
he
exhibited
:
a
cheerfulness
quite
foreign
to
his
previous
character
,
an
interest
readily
aroused
,
and
then
very
tenacious
,
in
small
matters
which
he
had
heretofore
despised
.
when
he
was
stricken
down
,
i
was
his
only
confidant
,
and
i
may
say
his
only
friend
,
and
he
was
on
terms
of
division
with
his
wife
;
upon
his
recovery
,
all
was
changed
,
the
past
forgotten
,
the
wife
first
and
even
single
in
his
thoughts
.
he
turned
to
her
with
all
his
emotions
,
like
a
child
to
its
mother
,
and
seemed
secure
of
sympathy
;
called
her
in
all
his
needs
with
something
of
that
querulous
familiarity
that
marks
a
certainty
of
indulgence
;
and
i
must
say
,
in
justice
to
the
woman
,
he
was
never
disappointed
.
to
her
,
indeed
,
this
changed
behaviour
was
inexpressibly
affecting
;
and
i
think
she
felt
it
secretly
as
a
reproach
;
so
that
i
have
seen
her
,
in
early
days
,
escape
out
of
the
room
that
she
might
indulge
herself
in
weeping
.
but
to
me
the
change
appeared
not
natural
;
and
viewing
it
along
with
all
the
rest
,
i
began
to
wonder
,
with
many
head
-
shakings
,
whether
his
reason
were
perfectly
erect
.
as
this
doubt
stretched
over
many
years
,
endured
indeed
until
my
master
'
s
death
,
and
clouded
all
our
subsequent
relations
,
i
may
well
consider
of
it
more
at
large
.
when
he
was
able
to
resume
some
charge
of
his
affairs
,
i
had
many
opportunities
to
try
him
with
precision
.
there
was
no
lack
of
understanding
,
nor
yet
of
authority
;
but
the
old
continuous
interest
had
quite
departed
;
he
grew
readily
fatigued
,
and
fell
to
yawning
;
and
he
carried
into
money
relations
,
where
it
is
certainly
out
of
place
,
a
facility
that
bordered
upon
slackness
.
true
,
since
we
had
no
longer
the
exactions
of
the
master
to
contend
against
,
there
was
the
less
occasion
to
raise
strictness
into
principle
or
do
battle
for
a
farthing
.
true
,
again
,
there
was
nothing
excessive
in
these
relaxations
,
or
i
would
have
been
no
party
to
them
.
but
the
whole
thing
marked
a
change
,
very
slight
yet
very
perceptible
;
and
though
no
man
could
say
my
master
had
gone
at
all
out
of
his
mind
,
no
man
could
deny
that
he
had
drifted
from
his
character
.
it
was
