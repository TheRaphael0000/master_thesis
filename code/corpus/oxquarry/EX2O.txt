the
signora
had
no
business
to
do
it
said
miss
bartlett
no
business
at
all
she
promised
us
south
rooms
with
a
view
close
together
instead
of
which
here
are
north
rooms
looking
into
a
courtyard
and
a
long
way
apart
oh
lucy
and
a
cockney
besides
said
lucy
who
had
been
further
saddened
by
the
signora
'
s
unexpected
accent
it
might
be
london
she
looked
at
the
two
rows
of
english
people
who
were
sitting
at
the
table
at
the
row
of
white
bottles
of
water
and
red
bottles
of
wine
that
ran
between
the
english
people
at
the
portraits
of
the
late
queen
and
the
late
poet
laureate
that
hung
behind
the
english
people
heavily
framed
at
the
notice
of
the
english
church
(
rev
cuthbert
eager
m
a
oxon
)
that
was
the
only
other
decoration
of
the
wall
charlotte
do
not
you
feel
too
that
we
might
be
in
london
i
can
hardly
believe
that
all
kinds
of
other
things
are
just
outside
i
suppose
it
is
one
'
s
being
so
tired
this
meat
has
surely
been
used
for
soup
said
miss
bartlett
laying
down
her
fork
i
want
so
to
see
the
arno
the
rooms
the
signora
promised
us
in
her
letter
would
have
looked
over
the
arno
the
signora
had
no
business
to
do
it
at
all
oh
it
is
a
shame
any
nook
does
for
me
miss
bartlett
continued
but
it
does
seem
hard
that
you
should
not
have
a
view
lucy
felt
that
she
had
been
selfish
charlotte
you
must
not
spoil
me
of
course
you
must
look
over
the
arno
too
i
meant
that
the
first
vacant
room
in
the
front
you
must
have
it
said
miss
bartlett
part
of
whose
travelling
expenses
were
paid
by
lucy
'
s
mother
a
piece
of
generosity
to
which
she
made
many
a
tactful
allusion
no
no
you
must
have
it
i
insist
on
it
your
mother
would
never
forgive
me
lucy
she
would
never
forgive
me
the
ladies
'
voices
grew
animated
and
if
the
sad
truth
be
owned
a
little
peevish
they
were
tired
and
under
the
guise
of
unselfishness
they
wrangled
some
of
their
neighbours
interchanged
glances
and
one
of
them
one
of
the
ill
-
bred
people
whom
one
does
meet
abroad
leant
forward
over
the
table
and
actually
intruded
into
their
argument
he
said
i
have
a
view
i
have
a
view
miss
bartlett
was
startled
generally
at
a
pension
people
looked
them
over
for
a
day
or
two
before
speaking
and
often
did
not
find
out
that
they
would
do
till
they
had
gone
she
knew
that
the
intruder
was
ill
-
bred
even
before
she
glanced
at
him
he
was
an
old
man
of
heavy
build
with
a
fair
shaven
face
and
large
eyes
there
was
something
childish
in
those
eyes
though
it
was
not
the
childishness
of
senility
what
exactly
it
was
miss
bartlett
did
not
stop
to
consider
for
her
glance
passed
on
to
his
clothes
these
did
not
attract
her
he
was
probably
trying
to
become
acquainted
with
them
before
they
got
into
the
swim
so
she
assumed
a
dazed
expression
when
he
spoke
to
her
and
then
said
a
view
oh
a
view
how
delightful
a
view
is
this
is
my
son
said
the
old
man
his
name
'
s
george
he
has
a
view
too
ah
said
miss
bartlett
repressing
lucy
who
was
about
to
speak
what
i
mean
he
continued
is
that
you
can
have
our
rooms
and
we
will
have
yours
we
will
change
the
better
class
of
tourist
was
shocked
at
this
and
sympathized
with
the
new
-
comers
miss
bartlett
in
reply
opened
her
mouth
as
little
as
possible
and
said
thank
you
very
much
indeed
that
is
out
of
the
question
why
said
the
old
man
with
both
fists
on
the
table
because
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
thank
you
you
see
we
do
not
like
to
take
began
lucy
her
cousin
again
repressed
her
but
why
he
persisted
women
like
looking
at
a
view
men
do
not
and
he
thumped
with
his
fists
like
a
naughty
child
and
turned
to
his
son
saying
george
persuade
them
it
is
so
obvious
they
should
have
the
rooms
said
the
son
there
'
s
nothing
else
to
say
he
did
not
look
at
the
ladies
as
he
spoke
but
his
voice
was
perplexed
and
sorrowful
lucy
too
was
perplexed
but
she
saw
that
they
were
in
for
what
is
known
as
quite
a
scene
and
she
had
an
odd
feeling
that
whenever
these
ill
-
bred
tourists
spoke
the
contest
widened
and
deepened
till
it
dealt
not
with
rooms
and
views
but
with
well
with
something
quite
different
whose
existence
she
had
not
realized
before
now
the
old
man
attacked
miss
bartlett
almost
violently
why
should
she
not
change
what
possible
objection
had
she
they
would
clear
out
in
half
an
hour
miss
bartlett
though
skilled
in
the
delicacies
of
conversation
was
powerless
in
the
presence
of
brutality
it
was
impossible
to
snub
any
one
so
gross
her
face
reddened
with
displeasure
she
looked
around
as
much
as
to
say
are
you
all
like
this
and
two
little
old
ladies
who
were
sitting
further
up
the
table
with
shawls
hanging
over
the
backs
of
the
chairs
looked
back
clearly
indicating
we
are
not
we
are
genteel
eat
your
dinner
dear
she
said
to
lucy
and
began
to
toy
again
with
the
meat
that
she
had
once
censured
lucy
mumbled
that
those
seemed
very
odd
people
opposite
eat
your
dinner
dear
this
pension
is
a
failure
to
-
morrow
we
will
make
a
change
hardly
had
she
announced
this
fell
decision
when
she
reversed
it
the
curtains
at
the
end
of
the
room
parted
and
revealed
a
clergyman
stout
but
attractive
who
hurried
forward
to
take
his
place
at
the
table
cheerfully
apologizing
for
his
lateness
lucy
who
had
not
yet
acquired
decency
at
once
rose
to
her
feet
exclaiming
oh
oh
why
it
is
mr
beebe
oh
how
perfectly
lovely
oh
charlotte
we
must
stop
now
however
bad
the
rooms
are
oh
miss
bartlett
said
with
more
restraint
how
do
you
do
mr
beebe
i
expect
that
you
have
forgotten
us
miss
bartlett
and
miss
honeychurch
who
were
at
tunbridge
wells
when
you
helped
the
vicar
of
st
peter
'
s
that
very
cold
easter
the
clergyman
who
had
the
air
of
one
on
a
holiday
did
not
remember
the
ladies
quite
as
clearly
as
they
remembered
him
but
he
came
forward
pleasantly
enough
and
accepted
the
chair
into
which
he
was
beckoned
by
lucy
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
said
the
girl
who
was
in
a
state
of
spiritual
starvation
and
would
have
been
glad
to
see
the
waiter
if
her
cousin
had
permitted
it
just
fancy
how
small
the
world
is
summer
street
too
makes
it
so
specially
funny
miss
honeychurch
lives
in
the
parish
of
summer
street
said
miss
bartlett
filling
up
the
gap
and
she
happened
to
tell
me
in
the
course
of
conversation
that
you
have
just
accepted
the
living
yes
i
heard
from
mother
so
last
week
she
did
not
know
that
i
knew
you
at
tunbridge
wells
but
i
wrote
back
at
once
and
i
said
'
mr
beebe
is
quite
right
said
the
clergyman
i
move
into
the
rectory
at
summer
street
next
june
i
am
lucky
to
be
appointed
to
such
a
charming
neighbourhood
oh
how
glad
i
am
the
name
of
our
house
is
windy
corner
mr
beebe
bowed
there
is
mother
and
me
generally
and
my
brother
though
it
is
not
often
we
get
him
to
ch
the
church
is
rather
far
off
i
mean
lucy
dearest
let
mr
beebe
eat
his
dinner
i
am
eating
it
thank
you
and
enjoying
it
he
preferred
to
talk
to
lucy
whose
playing
he
remembered
rather
than
to
miss
bartlett
who
probably
remembered
his
sermons
he
asked
the
girl
whether
she
knew
florence
well
and
was
informed
at
some
length
that
she
had
never
been
there
before
it
is
delightful
to
advise
a
newcomer
and
he
was
first
in
the
field
do
not
neglect
the
country
round
his
advice
concluded
the
first
fine
afternoon
drive
up
to
fiesole
and
round
by
settignano
or
something
of
that
sort
no
cried
a
voice
from
the
top
of
the
table
mr
beebe
you
are
wrong
the
first
fine
afternoon
your
ladies
must
go
to
prato
that
lady
looks
so
clever
whispered
miss
bartlett
to
her
cousin
we
are
in
luck
and
indeed
a
perfect
torrent
of
information
burst
on
them
people
told
them
what
to
see
when
to
see
it
how
to
stop
the
electric
trams
how
to
get
rid
of
the
beggars
how
much
to
give
for
a
vellum
blotter
how
much
the
place
would
grow
upon
them
the
pension
bertolini
had
decided
almost
enthusiastically
that
they
would
do
whichever
way
they
looked
kind
ladies
smiled
and
shouted
at
them
and
above
all
rose
the
voice
of
the
clever
lady
crying
prato
they
must
go
to
prato
that
place
is
too
sweetly
squalid
for
words
i
love
it
i
revel
in
shaking
off
the
trammels
of
respectability
as
you
know
the
young
man
named
george
glanced
at
the
clever
lady
and
then
returned
moodily
to
his
plate
obviously
he
and
his
father
did
not
do
lucy
in
the
midst
of
her
success
found
time
to
wish
they
did
it
gave
her
no
extra
pleasure
that
any
one
should
be
left
in
the
cold
and
when
she
rose
to
go
she
turned
back
and
gave
the
two
outsiders
a
nervous
little
bow
the
father
did
not
see
it
the
son
acknowledged
it
not
by
another
bow
but
by
raising
his
eyebrows
and
smiling
he
seemed
to
be
smiling
across
something
she
hastened
after
her
cousin
who
had
already
disappeared
through
the
curtains
curtains
which
smote
one
in
the
face
and
seemed
heavy
with
more
than
cloth
beyond
them
stood
the
unreliable
signora
bowing
good
-
evening
to
her
guests
and
supported
by
'
enery
her
little
boy
and
victorier
her
daughter
it
made
a
curious
little
scene
this
attempt
of
the
cockney
to
convey
the
grace
and
geniality
of
the
south
and
even
more
curious
was
the
drawing
-
room
which
attempted
to
rival
the
solid
comfort
of
a
bloomsbury
boarding
-
house
was
this
really
italy
miss
bartlett
was
already
seated
on
a
tightly
stuffed
arm
-
chair
which
had
the
colour
and
the
contours
of
a
tomato
she
was
talking
to
mr
beebe
and
as
she
spoke
her
long
narrow
head
drove
backwards
and
forwards
slowly
regularly
as
though
she
were
demolishing
some
invisible
obstacle
we
are
most
grateful
to
you
she
was
saying
the
first
evening
means
so
much
when
you
arrived
we
were
in
for
a
peculiarly
mauvais
quart
d
'
heure
he
expressed
his
regret
do
you
by
any
chance
know
the
name
of
an
old
man
who
sat
opposite
us
at
dinner
emerson
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
we
are
friendly
as
one
is
in
pensions
then
i
will
say
no
more
he
pressed
her
very
slightly
and
she
said
more
i
am
as
it
were
she
concluded
the
chaperon
of
my
young
cousin
lucy
and
it
would
be
a
serious
thing
if
i
put
her
under
an
obligation
to
people
of
whom
we
know
nothing
his
manner
was
somewhat
unfortunate
i
hope
i
acted
for
the
best
you
acted
very
naturally
said
he
he
seemed
thoughtful
and
after
a
few
moments
added
all
the
same
i
do
not
think
much
harm
would
have
come
of
accepting
no
harm
of
course
but
we
could
not
be
under
an
obligation
he
is
rather
a
peculiar
man
again
he
hesitated
and
then
said
gently
i
think
he
would
not
take
advantage
of
your
acceptance
nor
expect
you
to
show
gratitude
he
has
the
merit
if
it
is
one
of
saying
exactly
what
he
means
he
has
rooms
he
does
not
value
and
he
thinks
you
would
value
them
he
no
more
thought
of
putting
you
under
an
obligation
than
he
thought
of
being
polite
it
is
so
difficult
at
least
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
people
who
speak
the
truth
lucy
was
pleased
and
said
i
was
hoping
that
he
was
nice
i
do
so
always
hope
that
people
will
be
nice
i
think
he
is
nice
and
tiresome
i
differ
from
him
on
almost
every
point
of
any
importance
and
so
i
expect
i
may
say
i
hope
you
will
differ
but
his
is
a
type
one
disagrees
with
rather
than
deplores
when
he
first
came
here
he
not
unnaturally
put
people
'
s
backs
up
he
has
no
tact
and
no
manners
i
do
not
mean
by
that
that
he
has
bad
manners
and
he
will
not
keep
his
opinions
to
himself
we
nearly
complained
about
him
to
our
depressing
signora
but
i
am
glad
to
say
we
thought
better
of
it
am
i
to
conclude
said
miss
bartlett
that
he
is
a
socialist
mr
beebe
accepted
the
convenient
word
not
without
a
slight
twitching
of
the
lips
and
presumably
he
has
brought
up
his
son
to
be
a
socialist
too
i
hardly
know
george
for
he
has
not
learnt
to
talk
yet
he
seems
a
nice
creature
and
i
think
he
has
brains
of
course
he
has
all
his
father
'
s
mannerisms
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
he
too
may
be
a
socialist
oh
you
relieve
me
said
miss
bartlett
so
you
think
i
ought
to
have
accepted
their
offer
you
feel
i
have
been
narrow
-
minded
and
suspicious
not
at
all
he
answered
i
never
suggested
that
but
ought
i
not
to
apologize
at
all
events
for
my
apparent
rudeness
he
replied
with
some
irritation
that
it
would
be
quite
unnecessary
and
got
up
from
his
seat
to
go
to
the
smoking
-
room
was
i
a
bore
said
miss
bartlett
as
soon
as
he
had
disappeared
why
did
not
you
talk
lucy
he
prefers
young
people
i
am
sure
i
do
hope
i
have
not
monopolized
him
i
hoped
you
would
have
him
all
the
evening
as
well
as
all
dinner
-
time
he
is
nice
exclaimed
lucy
just
what
i
remember
he
seems
to
see
good
in
every
one
no
one
would
take
him
for
a
clergyman
my
dear
lucia
well
you
know
what
i
mean
and
you
know
how
clergymen
generally
laugh
mr
beebe
laughs
just
like
an
ordinary
man
funny
girl
how
you
do
remind
me
of
your
mother
i
wonder
if
she
will
approve
of
mr
beebe
i
am
sure
she
will
and
so
will
freddy
i
think
every
one
at
windy
corner
will
approve
it
is
the
fashionable
world
i
am
used
to
tunbridge
wells
where
we
are
all
hopelessly
behind
the
times
yes
said
lucy
despondently
there
was
a
haze
of
disapproval
in
the
air
but
whether
the
disapproval
was
of
herself
or
of
mr
beebe
or
of
the
fashionable
world
at
windy
corner
or
of
the
narrow
world
at
tunbridge
wells
she
could
not
determine
she
tried
to
locate
it
but
as
usual
she
blundered
miss
bartlett
sedulously
denied
disapproving
of
any
one
and
added
i
am
afraid
you
are
finding
me
a
very
depressing
companion
and
the
girl
again
thought
i
must
have
been
selfish
or
unkind
i
must
be
more
careful
it
is
so
dreadful
for
charlotte
being
poor
fortunately
one
of
the
little
old
ladies
who
for
some
time
had
been
smiling
very
benignly
now
approached
and
asked
if
she
might
be
allowed
to
sit
where
mr
beebe
had
sat
permission
granted
she
began
to
chatter
gently
about
italy
the
plunge
it
had
been
to
come
there
the
gratifying
success
of
the
plunge
the
improvement
in
her
sister
'
s
health
the
necessity
of
closing
the
bed
-
room
windows
at
night
and
of
thoroughly
emptying
the
water
-
bottles
in
the
morning
she
handled
her
subjects
agreeably
and
they
were
perhaps
more
worthy
of
attention
than
the
high
discourse
upon
guelfs
and
ghibellines
which
was
proceeding
tempestuously
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
it
was
a
real
catastrophe
not
a
mere
episode
that
evening
of
hers
at
venice
when
she
had
found
in
her
bedroom
something
that
is
one
worse
than
a
flea
though
one
better
than
something
else
but
here
you
are
as
safe
as
in
england
signora
bertolini
is
so
english
yet
our
rooms
smell
said
poor
lucy
we
dread
going
to
bed
ah
then
you
look
into
the
court
she
sighed
if
only
mr
emerson
was
more
tactful
we
were
so
sorry
for
you
at
dinner
i
think
he
was
meaning
to
be
kind
undoubtedly
he
was
said
miss
bartlett
mr
beebe
has
just
been
scolding
me
for
my
suspicious
nature
of
course
i
was
holding
back
on
my
cousin
'
s
account
of
course
said
the
little
old
lady
and
they
murmured
that
one
could
not
be
too
careful
with
a
young
girl
lucy
tried
to
look
demure
but
could
not
help
feeling
a
great
fool
no
one
was
careful
with
her
at
home
or
at
all
events
she
had
not
noticed
it
about
old
mr
emerson
i
hardly
know
no
he
is
not
tactful
yet
have
you
ever
noticed
that
there
are
people
who
do
things
which
are
most
indelicate
and
yet
at
the
same
time
beautiful
beautiful
said
miss
bartlett
puzzled
at
the
word
are
not
beauty
and
delicacy
the
same
so
one
would
have
thought
said
the
other
helplessly
but
things
are
so
difficult
i
sometimes
think
she
proceeded
no
further
into
things
for
mr
beebe
reappeared
looking
extremely
pleasant
miss
bartlett
he
cried
it
is
all
right
about
the
rooms
i
am
so
glad
mr
emerson
was
talking
about
it
in
the
smoking
-
room
and
knowing
what
i
did
i
encouraged
him
to
make
the
offer
again
he
has
let
me
come
and
ask
you
he
would
be
so
pleased
oh
charlotte
cried
lucy
to
her
cousin
we
must
have
the
rooms
now
the
old
man
is
just
as
nice
and
kind
as
he
can
be
miss
bartlett
was
silent
i
fear
said
mr
beebe
after
a
pause
that
i
have
been
officious
i
must
apologize
for
my
interference
gravely
displeased
he
turned
to
go
not
till
then
did
miss
bartlett
reply
my
own
wishes
dearest
lucy
are
unimportant
in
comparison
with
yours
it
would
be
hard
indeed
if
i
stopped
you
doing
as
you
liked
at
florence
when
i
am
only
here
through
your
kindness
if
you
wish
me
to
turn
these
gentlemen
out
of
their
rooms
i
will
do
it
would
you
then
mr
beebe
kindly
tell
mr
emerson
that
i
accept
his
kind
offer
and
then
conduct
him
to
me
in
order
that
i
may
thank
him
personally
she
raised
her
voice
as
she
spoke
it
was
heard
all
over
the
drawing
-
room
and
silenced
the
guelfs
and
the
ghibellines
the
clergyman
inwardly
cursing
the
female
sex
bowed
and
departed
with
her
message
remember
lucy
i
alone
am
implicated
in
this
i
do
not
wish
the
acceptance
to
come
from
you
grant
me
that
at
all
events
mr
beebe
was
back
saying
rather
nervously
mr
emerson
is
engaged
but
here
is
his
son
instead
the
young
man
gazed
down
on
the
three
ladies
who
felt
seated
on
the
floor
so
low
were
their
chairs
my
father
he
said
is
in
his
bath
so
you
cannot
thank
him
personally
but
any
message
given
by
you
to
me
will
be
given
by
me
to
him
as
soon
as
he
comes
out
miss
bartlett
was
unequal
to
the
bath
all
her
barbed
civilities
came
forth
wrong
end
first
young
mr
emerson
scored
a
notable
triumph
to
the
delight
of
mr
beebe
and
to
the
secret
delight
of
lucy
poor
young
man
said
miss
bartlett
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
how
angry
he
is
with
his
father
about
the
rooms
it
is
all
he
can
do
to
keep
polite
in
half
an
hour
or
so
your
rooms
will
be
ready
said
mr
beebe
then
looking
rather
thoughtfully
at
the
two
cousins
he
retired
to
his
own
rooms
to
write
up
his
philosophic
diary
oh
dear
breathed
the
little
old
lady
and
shuddered
as
if
all
the
winds
of
heaven
had
entered
the
apartment
gentlemen
sometimes
do
not
realize
her
voice
faded
away
but
miss
bartlett
seemed
to
understand
and
a
conversation
developed
in
which
gentlemen
who
did
not
thoroughly
realize
played
a
principal
part
lucy
not
realizing
either
was
reduced
to
literature
taking
up
baedeker
'
s
handbook
to
northern
italy
she
committed
to
memory
the
most
important
dates
of
florentine
history
for
she
was
determined
to
enjoy
herself
on
the
morrow
thus
the
half
-
hour
crept
profitably
away
and
at
last
miss
bartlett
rose
with
a
sigh
and
said
i
think
one
might
venture
now
no
lucy
do
not
stir
i
will
superintend
the
move
how
you
do
do
everything
said
lucy
naturally
dear
it
is
my
affair
but
i
would
like
to
help
you
no
dear
charlotte
'
s
energy
and
her
unselfishness
she
had
been
thus
all
her
life
but
really
on
this
italian
tour
she
was
surpassing
herself
so
lucy
felt
or
strove
to
feel
and
yet
there
was
a
rebellious
spirit
in
her
which
wondered
whether
the
acceptance
might
not
have
been
less
delicate
and
more
beautiful
at
all
events
she
entered
her
own
room
without
any
feeling
of
joy
i
want
to
explain
said
miss
bartlett
why
it
is
that
i
have
taken
the
largest
room
naturally
of
course
i
should
have
given
it
to
you
but
i
happen
to
know
that
it
belongs
to
the
young
man
and
i
was
sure
your
mother
would
not
like
it
lucy
was
bewildered
if
you
are
to
accept
a
favour
it
is
more
suitable
you
should
be
under
an
obligation
to
his
father
than
to
him
i
am
a
woman
of
the
world
in
my
small
way
and
i
know
where
things
lead
to
how
-
ever
mr
beebe
is
a
guarantee
of
a
sort
that
they
will
not
presume
on
this
mother
would
not
mind
i
am
sure
said
lucy
but
again
had
the
sense
of
larger
and
unsuspected
issues
miss
bartlett
only
sighed
and
enveloped
her
in
a
protecting
embrace
as
she
wished
her
good
-
night
it
gave
lucy
the
sensation
of
a
fog
and
when
she
reached
her
own
room
she
opened
the
window
and
breathed
the
clean
night
air
thinking
of
the
kind
old
man
who
had
enabled
her
to
see
the
lights
dancing
in
the
arno
and
the
cypresses
of
san
miniato
and
the
foot
-
hills
of
the
apennines
black
against
the
rising
moon
miss
bartlett
in
her
room
fastened
the
window
-
shutters
and
locked
the
door
and
then
made
a
tour
of
the
apartment
to
see
where
the
cupboards
led
and
whether
there
were
any
oubliettes
or
secret
entrances
it
was
then
that
she
saw
pinned
up
over
the
washstand
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
was
scrawled
an
enormous
note
of
interrogation
nothing
more
what
does
it
mean
she
thought
and
she
examined
it
carefully
by
the
light
of
a
candle
meaningless
at
first
it
gradually
became
menacing
obnoxious
portentous
with
evil
she
was
seized
with
an
impulse
to
destroy
it
but
fortunately
remembered
that
she
had
no
right
to
do
so
since
it
must
be
the
property
of
young
mr
emerson
so
she
unpinned
it
carefully
and
put
it
between
two
pieces
of
blotting
-
paper
to
keep
it
clean
for
him
then
she
completed
her
inspection
of
the
room
sighed
heavily
according
to
her
habit
and
went
to
bed
it
was
pleasant
to
wake
up
in
florence
to
open
the
eyes
upon
a
bright
bare
room
with
a
floor
of
red
tiles
which
look
clean
though
they
are
not
with
a
painted
ceiling
whereon
pink
griffins
and
blue
amorini
sport
in
a
forest
of
yellow
violins
and
bassoons
it
was
pleasant
too
to
fling
wide
the
windows
pinching
the
fingers
in
unfamiliar
fastenings
to
lean
out
into
sunshine
with
beautiful
hills
and
trees
and
marble
churches
opposite
and
close
below
the
arno
gurgling
against
the
embankment
of
the
road
over
the
river
men
were
at
work
with
spades
and
sieves
on
the
sandy
foreshore
and
on
the
river
was
a
boat
also
diligently
employed
for
some
mysterious
end
an
electric
tram
came
rushing
underneath
the
window
no
one
was
inside
it
except
one
tourist
but
its
platforms
were
overflowing
with
italians
who
preferred
to
stand
children
tried
to
hang
on
behind
and
the
conductor
with
no
malice
spat
in
their
faces
to
make
them
let
go
then
soldiers
appeared
good
-
looking
undersized
men
wearing
each
a
knapsack
covered
with
mangy
fur
and
a
great
-
coat
which
had
been
cut
for
some
larger
soldier
beside
them
walked
officers
looking
foolish
and
fierce
and
before
them
went
little
boys
turning
somersaults
in
time
with
the
band
the
tramcar
became
entangled
in
their
ranks
and
moved
on
painfully
like
a
caterpillar
in
a
swarm
of
ants
one
of
the
little
boys
fell
down
and
some
white
bullocks
came
out
of
an
archway
indeed
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
good
advice
of
an
old
man
who
was
selling
button
-
hooks
the
road
might
never
have
got
clear
over
such
trivialities
as
these
many
a
valuable
hour
may
slip
away
and
the
traveller
who
has
gone
to
italy
to
study
the
tactile
values
of
giotto
or
the
corruption
of
the
papacy
may
return
remembering
nothing
but
the
blue
sky
and
the
men
and
women
who
live
under
it
so
it
was
as
well
that
miss
bartlett
should
tap
and
come
in
and
having
commented
on
lucy
'
s
leaving
the
door
unlocked
and
on
her
leaning
out
of
the
window
before
she
was
fully
dressed
should
urge
her
to
hasten
herself
or
the
best
of
the
day
would
be
gone
by
the
time
lucy
was
ready
her
cousin
had
done
her
breakfast
and
was
listening
to
the
clever
lady
among
the
crumbs
a
conversation
then
ensued
on
not
unfamiliar
lines
miss
bartlett
was
after
all
a
wee
bit
tired
and
thought
they
had
better
spend
the
morning
settling
in
unless
lucy
would
at
all
like
to
go
out
lucy
would
rather
like
to
go
out
as
it
was
her
first
day
in
florence
but
of
course
she
could
go
alone
miss
bartlett
could
not
allow
this
of
course
she
would
accompany
lucy
everywhere
oh
certainly
not
lucy
would
stop
with
her
cousin
oh
no
that
would
never
do
oh
yes
at
this
point
the
clever
lady
broke
in
if
it
is
mrs
grundy
who
is
troubling
you
i
do
assure
you
that
you
can
neglect
the
good
person
being
english
miss
honeychurch
will
be
perfectly
safe
italians
understand
a
dear
friend
of
mine
contessa
baroncelli
has
two
daughters
and
when
she
cannot
send
a
maid
to
school
with
them
she
lets
them
go
in
sailor
-
hats
instead
every
one
takes
them
for
english
you
see
especially
if
their
hair
is
strained
tightly
behind
miss
bartlett
was
unconvinced
by
the
safety
of
contessa
baroncelli
'
s
daughters
she
was
determined
to
take
lucy
herself
her
head
not
being
so
very
bad
the
clever
lady
then
said
that
she
was
going
to
spend
a
long
morning
in
santa
croce
and
if
lucy
would
come
too
she
would
be
delighted
i
will
take
you
by
a
dear
dirty
back
way
miss
honeychurch
and
if
you
bring
me
luck
we
shall
have
an
adventure
lucy
said
that
this
was
most
kind
and
at
once
opened
the
baedeker
to
see
where
santa
croce
was
tut
tut
miss
lucy
i
hope
we
shall
soon
emancipate
you
from
baedeker
he
does
but
touch
the
surface
of
things
as
to
the
true
italy
he
does
not
even
dream
of
it
the
true
italy
is
only
to
be
found
by
patient
observation
this
sounded
very
interesting
and
lucy
hurried
over
her
breakfast
and
started
with
her
new
friend
in
high
spirits
italy
was
coming
at
last
the
cockney
signora
and
her
works
had
vanished
like
a
bad
dream
miss
lavish
for
that
was
the
clever
lady
'
s
name
turned
to
the
right
along
the
sunny
lung
'
arno
how
delightfully
warm
but
a
wind
down
the
side
streets
cut
like
a
knife
did
not
it
ponte
alle
grazie
particularly
interesting
mentioned
by
dante
san
miniato
beautiful
as
well
as
interesting
the
crucifix
that
kissed
a
murderer
miss
honeychurch
would
remember
the
story
the
men
on
the
river
were
fishing
(
untrue
but
then
so
is
most
information
)
then
miss
lavish
darted
under
the
archway
of
the
white
bullocks
and
she
stopped
and
she
cried
a
smell
a
true
florentine
smell
every
city
let
me
teach
you
has
its
own
smell
is
it
a
very
nice
smell
said
lucy
who
had
inherited
from
her
mother
a
distaste
to
dirt
one
does
not
come
to
italy
for
niceness
was
the
retort
one
comes
for
life
buon
giorno
buon
giorno
bowing
right
and
left
look
at
that
adorable
wine
-
cart
how
the
driver
stares
at
us
dear
simple
soul
so
miss
lavish
proceeded
through
the
streets
of
the
city
of
florence
short
fidgety
and
playful
as
a
kitten
though
without
a
kitten
'
s
grace
it
was
a
treat
for
the
girl
to
be
with
any
one
so
clever
and
so
cheerful
and
a
blue
military
cloak
such
as
an
italian
officer
wears
only
increased
the
sense
of
festivity
buon
giorno
take
the
word
of
an
old
woman
miss
lucy
you
will
never
repent
of
a
little
civility
to
your
inferiors
that
is
the
true
democracy
though
i
am
a
real
radical
as
well
there
now
you
are
shocked
indeed
i
am
not
exclaimed
lucy
we
are
radicals
too
out
and
out
my
father
always
voted
for
mr
gladstone
until
he
was
so
dreadful
about
ireland
i
see
i
see
and
now
you
have
gone
over
to
the
enemy
oh
please
if
my
father
was
alive
i
am
sure
he
would
vote
radical
again
now
that
ireland
is
all
right
and
as
it
is
the
glass
over
our
front
door
was
broken
last
election
and
freddy
is
sure
it
was
the
tories
but
mother
says
nonsense
a
tramp
shameful
a
manufacturing
district
i
suppose
no
in
the
surrey
hills
about
five
miles
from
dorking
looking
over
the
weald
miss
lavish
seemed
interested
and
slackened
her
trot
what
a
delightful
part
i
know
it
so
well
it
is
full
of
the
very
nicest
people
do
you
know
sir
harry
otway
a
radical
if
ever
there
was
very
well
indeed
and
old
mrs
butterworth
the
philanthropist
why
she
rents
a
field
of
us
how
funny
miss
lavish
looked
at
the
narrow
ribbon
of
sky
and
murmured
oh
you
have
property
in
surrey
hardly
any
said
lucy
fearful
of
being
thought
a
snob
only
thirty
acres
just
the
garden
all
downhill
and
some
fields
miss
lavish
was
not
disgusted
and
said
it
was
just
the
size
of
her
aunt
'
s
suffolk
estate
italy
receded
they
tried
to
remember
the
last
name
of
lady
louisa
some
one
who
had
taken
a
house
near
summer
street
the
other
year
but
she
had
not
liked
it
which
was
odd
of
her
and
just
as
miss
lavish
had
got
the
name
she
broke
off
and
exclaimed
bless
us
bless
us
and
save
us
we
'
ve
lost
the
way
certainly
they
had
seemed
a
long
time
in
reaching
santa
croce
the
tower
of
which
had
been
plainly
visible
from
the
landing
window
but
miss
lavish
had
said
so
much
about
knowing
her
florence
by
heart
that
lucy
had
followed
her
with
no
misgivings
lost
lost
my
dear
miss
lucy
during
our
political
diatribes
we
have
taken
a
wrong
turning
how
those
horrid
conservatives
would
jeer
at
us
what
are
we
to
do
two
lone
females
in
an
unknown
town
now
this
is
what
i
call
an
adventure
lucy
who
wanted
to
see
santa
croce
suggested
as
a
possible
solution
that
they
should
ask
the
way
there
oh
but
that
is
the
word
of
a
craven
and
no
you
are
not
not
not
to
look
at
your
baedeker
give
it
to
me
i
sha
not
let
you
carry
it
we
will
simply
drift
accordingly
they
drifted
through
a
series
of
those
grey
-
brown
streets
neither
commodious
nor
picturesque
in
which
the
eastern
quarter
of
the
city
abounds
lucy
soon
lost
interest
in
the
discontent
of
lady
louisa
and
became
discontented
herself
for
one
ravishing
moment
italy
appeared
she
stood
in
the
square
of
the
annunziata
and
saw
in
the
living
terra
-
cotta
those
divine
babies
whom
no
cheap
reproduction
can
ever
stale
there
they
stood
with
their
shining
limbs
bursting
from
the
garments
of
charity
and
their
strong
white
arms
extended
against
circlets
of
heaven
lucy
thought
she
had
never
seen
anything
more
beautiful
but
miss
lavish
with
a
shriek
of
dismay
dragged
her
forward
declaring
that
they
were
out
of
their
path
now
by
at
least
a
mile
the
hour
was
approaching
at
which
the
continental
breakfast
begins
or
rather
ceases
to
tell
and
the
ladies
bought
some
hot
chestnut
paste
out
of
a
little
shop
because
it
looked
so
typical
it
tasted
partly
of
the
paper
in
which
it
was
wrapped
partly
of
hair
oil
partly
of
the
great
unknown
but
it
gave
them
strength
to
drift
into
another
piazza
large
and
dusty
on
the
farther
side
of
which
rose
a
black
-
and
-
white
facade
of
surpassing
ugliness
miss
lavish
spoke
to
it
dramatically
it
was
santa
croce
the
adventure
was
over
stop
a
minute
let
those
two
people
go
on
or
i
shall
have
to
speak
to
them
i
do
detest
conventional
intercourse
nasty
they
are
going
into
the
church
too
oh
the
britisher
abroad
we
sat
opposite
them
at
dinner
last
night
they
have
given
us
their
rooms
they
were
so
very
kind
look
at
their
figures
laughed
miss
lavish
they
walk
through
my
italy
like
a
pair
of
cows
it
is
very
naughty
of
me
but
i
would
like
to
set
an
examination
paper
at
dover
and
turn
back
every
tourist
who
could
not
pass
it
what
would
you
ask
us
miss
lavish
laid
her
hand
pleasantly
on
lucy
'
s
arm
as
if
to
suggest
that
she
at
all
events
would
get
full
marks
in
this
exalted
mood
they
reached
the
steps
of
the
great
church
and
were
about
to
enter
it
when
miss
lavish
stopped
squeaked
flung
up
her
arms
and
cried
there
goes
my
local
-
colour
box
i
must
have
a
word
with
him
and
in
a
moment
she
was
away
over
the
piazza
her
military
cloak
flapping
in
the
wind
nor
did
she
slacken
speed
till
she
caught
up
an
old
man
with
white
whiskers
and
nipped
him
playfully
upon
the
arm
lucy
waited
for
nearly
ten
minutes
then
she
began
to
get
tired
the
beggars
worried
her
the
dust
blew
in
her
eyes
and
she
remembered
that
a
young
girl
ought
not
to
loiter
in
public
places
she
descended
slowly
into
the
piazza
with
the
intention
of
rejoining
miss
lavish
who
was
really
almost
too
original
but
at
that
moment
miss
lavish
and
her
local
-
colour
box
moved
also
and
disappeared
down
a
side
street
both
gesticulating
largely
tears
of
indignation
came
to
lucy
'
s
eyes
partly
because
miss
lavish
had
jilted
her
partly
because
she
had
taken
her
baedeker
how
could
she
find
her
way
home
how
could
she
find
her
way
about
in
santa
croce
her
first
morning
was
ruined
and
she
might
never
be
in
florence
again
a
few
minutes
ago
she
had
been
all
high
spirits
talking
as
a
woman
of
culture
and
half
persuading
herself
that
she
was
full
of
originality
now
she
entered
the
church
depressed
and
humiliated
not
even
able
to
remember
whether
it
was
built
by
the
franciscans
or
the
dominicans
of
course
it
must
be
a
wonderful
building
but
how
like
a
barn
and
how
very
cold
of
course
it
contained
frescoes
by
giotto
in
the
presence
of
whose
tactile
values
she
was
capable
of
feeling
what
was
proper
but
who
was
to
tell
her
which
they
were
she
walked
about
disdainfully
unwilling
to
be
enthusiastic
over
monuments
of
uncertain
authorship
or
date
there
was
no
one
even
to
tell
her
which
of
all
the
sepulchral
slabs
that
paved
the
nave
and
transepts
was
the
one
that
was
really
beautiful
the
one
that
had
been
most
praised
by
mr
ruskin
then
the
pernicious
charm
of
italy
worked
on
her
and
instead
of
acquiring
information
she
began
to
be
happy
she
puzzled
out
the
italian
notices
the
notices
that
forbade
people
to
introduce
dogs
into
the
church
the
notice
that
prayed
people
in
the
interest
of
health
and
out
of
respect
to
the
sacred
edifice
in
which
they
found
themselves
not
to
spit
she
watched
the
tourists
their
noses
were
as
red
as
their
baedekers
so
cold
was
santa
croce
she
beheld
the
horrible
fate
that
overtook
three
papists
two
he
-
babies
and
a
she
-
baby
who
began
their
career
by
sousing
each
other
with
the
holy
water
and
then
proceeded
to
the
machiavelli
memorial
dripping
but
hallowed
advancing
towards
it
very
slowly
and
from
immense
distances
they
touched
the
stone
with
their
fingers
with
their
handkerchiefs
with
their
heads
and
then
retreated
what
could
this
mean
they
did
it
again
and
again
then
lucy
realized
that
they
had
mistaken
machiavelli
for
some
saint
hoping
to
acquire
virtue
punishment
followed
quickly
the
smallest
he
-
baby
stumbled
over
one
of
the
sepulchral
slabs
so
much
admired
by
mr
ruskin
and
entangled
his
feet
in
the
features
of
a
recumbent
bishop
protestant
as
she
was
lucy
darted
forward
she
was
too
late
he
fell
heavily
upon
the
prelate
'
s
upturned
toes
hateful
bishop
exclaimed
the
voice
of
old
mr
emerson
who
had
darted
forward
also
hard
in
life
hard
in
death
go
out
into
the
sunshine
little
boy
and
kiss
your
hand
to
the
sun
for
that
is
where
you
ought
to
be
intolerable
bishop
the
child
screamed
frantically
at
these
words
and
at
these
dreadful
people
who
picked
him
up
dusted
him
rubbed
his
bruises
and
told
him
not
to
be
superstitious
look
at
him
said
mr
emerson
to
lucy
here
'
s
a
mess
a
baby
hurt
cold
and
frightened
but
what
else
can
you
expect
from
a
church
the
child
'
s
legs
had
become
as
melting
wax
each
time
that
old
mr
emerson
and
lucy
set
it
erect
it
collapsed
with
a
roar
fortunately
an
italian
lady
who
ought
to
have
been
saying
her
prayers
came
to
the
rescue
by
some
mysterious
virtue
which
mothers
alone
possess
she
stiffened
the
little
boy
'
s
back
-
bone
and
imparted
strength
to
his
knees
he
stood
still
gibbering
with
agitation
he
walked
away
you
are
a
clever
woman
said
mr
emerson
you
have
done
more
than
all
the
relics
in
the
world
i
am
not
of
your
creed
but
i
do
believe
in
those
who
make
their
fellow
-
creatures
happy
there
is
no
scheme
of
the
universe
he
paused
for
a
phrase
niente
said
the
italian
lady
and
returned
to
her
prayers
i
am
not
sure
she
understands
english
suggested
lucy
in
her
chastened
mood
she
no
longer
despised
the
emersons
she
was
determined
to
be
gracious
to
them
beautiful
rather
than
delicate
and
if
possible
to
erase
miss
bartlett
'
s
civility
by
some
gracious
reference
to
the
pleasant
rooms
that
woman
understands
everything
was
mr
emerson
'
s
reply
but
what
are
you
doing
here
are
you
doing
the
church
are
you
through
with
the
church
no
cried
lucy
remembering
her
grievance
i
came
here
with
miss
lavish
who
was
to
explain
everything
and
just
by
the
door
it
is
too
bad
she
simply
ran
away
and
after
waiting
quite
a
time
i
had
to
come
in
by
myself
why
should
not
you
said
mr
emerson
yes
why
should
not
you
come
by
yourself
said
the
son
addressing
the
young
lady
for
the
first
time
but
miss
lavish
has
even
taken
away
baedeker
baedeker
said
mr
emerson
i
am
glad
it
is
that
you
minded
it
is
worth
minding
the
loss
of
a
baedeker
that
'
s
worth
minding
lucy
was
puzzled
she
was
again
conscious
of
some
new
idea
and
was
not
sure
whither
it
would
lead
her
if
you
'
ve
no
baedeker
said
the
son
you
'
d
better
join
us
was
this
where
the
idea
would
lead
she
took
refuge
in
her
dignity
thank
you
very
much
but
i
could
not
think
of
that
i
hope
you
do
not
suppose
that
i
came
to
join
on
to
you
i
really
came
to
help
with
the
child
and
to
thank
you
for
so
kindly
giving
us
your
rooms
last
night
i
hope
that
you
have
not
been
put
to
any
great
inconvenience
my
dear
said
the
old
man
gently
i
think
that
you
are
repeating
what
you
have
heard
older
people
say
you
are
pretending
to
be
touchy
but
you
are
not
really
stop
being
so
tiresome
and
tell
me
instead
what
part
of
the
church
you
want
to
see
to
take
you
to
it
will
be
a
real
pleasure
now
this
was
abominably
impertinent
and
she
ought
to
have
been
furious
but
it
is
sometimes
as
difficult
to
lose
one
'
s
temper
as
it
is
difficult
at
other
times
to
keep
it
lucy
could
not
get
cross
mr
emerson
was
an
old
man
and
surely
a
girl
might
humour
him
on
the
other
hand
his
son
was
a
young
man
and
she
felt
that
a
girl
ought
to
be
offended
with
him
or
at
all
events
be
offended
before
him
it
was
at
him
that
she
gazed
before
replying
i
am
not
touchy
i
hope
it
is
the
giottos
that
i
want
to
see
if
you
will
kindly
tell
me
which
they
are
the
son
nodded
with
a
look
of
sombre
satisfaction
he
led
the
way
to
the
peruzzi
chapel
there
was
a
hint
of
the
teacher
about
him
she
felt
like
a
child
in
school
who
had
answered
a
question
rightly
the
chapel
was
already
filled
with
an
earnest
congregation
and
out
of
them
rose
the
voice
of
a
lecturer
directing
them
how
to
worship
giotto
not
by
tactful
valuations
but
by
the
standards
of
the
spirit
remember
he
was
saying
the
facts
about
this
church
of
santa
croce
how
it
was
built
by
faith
in
the
full
fervour
of
medievalism
before
any
taint
of
the
renaissance
had
appeared
observe
how
giotto
in
these
frescoes
now
unhappily
ruined
by
restoration
is
untroubled
by
the
snares
of
anatomy
and
perspective
could
anything
be
more
majestic
more
pathetic
beautiful
true
how
little
we
feel
avails
knowledge
and
technical
cleverness
against
a
man
who
truly
feels
no
exclaimed
mr
emerson
in
much
too
loud
a
voice
for
church
remember
nothing
of
the
sort
built
by
faith
indeed
that
simply
means
the
workmen
were
not
paid
properly
and
as
for
the
frescoes
i
see
no
truth
in
them
look
at
that
fat
man
in
blue
he
must
weigh
as
much
as
i
do
and
he
is
shooting
into
the
sky
like
an
air
balloon
he
was
referring
to
the
fresco
of
the
ascension
of
st
john
inside
the
lecturer
'
s
voice
faltered
as
well
it
might
the
audience
shifted
uneasily
and
so
did
lucy
she
was
sure
that
she
ought
not
to
be
with
these
men
but
they
had
cast
a
spell
over
her
they
were
so
serious
and
so
strange
that
she
could
not
remember
how
to
behave
now
did
this
happen
or
did
not
it
yes
or
no
george
replied
it
happened
like
this
if
it
happened
at
all
i
would
rather
go
up
to
heaven
by
myself
than
be
pushed
by
cherubs
and
if
i
got
there
i
should
like
my
friends
to
lean
out
of
it
just
as
they
do
here
you
will
never
go
up
said
his
father
you
and
i
dear
boy
will
lie
at
peace
in
the
earth
that
bore
us
and
our
names
will
disappear
as
surely
as
our
work
survives
some
of
the
people
can
only
see
the
empty
grave
not
the
saint
whoever
he
is
going
up
it
did
happen
like
that
if
it
happened
at
all
pardon
me
said
a
frigid
voice
the
chapel
is
somewhat
small
for
two
parties
we
will
incommode
you
no
longer
the
lecturer
was
a
clergyman
and
his
audience
must
be
also
his
flock
for
they
held
prayer
-
books
as
well
as
guide
-
books
in
their
hands
they
filed
out
of
the
chapel
in
silence
amongst
them
were
the
two
little
old
ladies
of
the
pension
bertolini
miss
teresa
and
miss
catherine
alan
stop
cried
mr
emerson
there
'
s
plenty
of
room
for
us
all
stop
the
procession
disappeared
without
a
word
soon
the
lecturer
could
be
heard
in
the
next
chapel
describing
the
life
of
st
francis
george
i
do
believe
that
clergyman
is
the
brixton
curate
george
went
into
the
next
chapel
and
returned
saying
perhaps
he
is
i
do
not
remember
then
i
had
better
speak
to
him
and
remind
him
who
i
am
it
is
that
mr
eager
why
did
he
go
did
we
talk
too
loud
how
vexatious
i
shall
go
and
say
we
are
sorry
had
not
i
better
then
perhaps
he
will
come
back
he
will
not
come
back
said
george
but
mr
emerson
contrite
and
unhappy
hurried
away
to
apologize
to
the
rev
cuthbert
eager
lucy
apparently
absorbed
in
a
lunette
could
hear
the
lecture
again
interrupted
the
anxious
aggressive
voice
of
the
old
man
the
curt
injured
replies
of
his
opponent
the
son
who
took
every
little
contretemps
as
if
it
were
a
tragedy
was
listening
also
my
father
has
that
effect
on
nearly
every
one
he
informed
her
he
will
try
to
be
kind
i
hope
we
all
try
said
she
smiling
nervously
because
we
think
it
improves
our
characters
but
he
is
kind
to
people
because
he
loves
them
and
they
find
him
out
and
are
offended
or
frightened
how
silly
of
them
said
lucy
though
in
her
heart
she
sympathized
i
think
that
a
kind
action
done
tactfully
tact
he
threw
up
his
head
in
disdain
apparently
she
had
given
the
wrong
answer
she
watched
the
singular
creature
pace
up
and
down
the
chapel
for
a
young
man
his
face
was
rugged
and
until
the
shadows
fell
upon
it
hard
enshadowed
it
sprang
into
tenderness
she
saw
him
once
again
at
rome
on
the
ceiling
of
the
sistine
chapel
carrying
a
burden
of
acorns
healthy
and
muscular
he
yet
gave
her
the
feeling
of
greyness
of
tragedy
that
might
only
find
solution
in
the
night
the
feeling
soon
passed
it
was
unlike
her
to
have
entertained
anything
so
subtle
born
of
silence
and
of
unknown
emotion
it
passed
when
mr
emerson
returned
and
she
could
re
-
enter
the
world
of
rapid
talk
which
was
alone
familiar
to
her
were
you
snubbed
asked
his
son
tranquilly
but
we
have
spoilt
the
pleasure
of
i
do
not
know
how
many
people
they
wo
not
come
back
full
of
innate
sympathy
quickness
to
perceive
good
in
others
vision
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
scraps
of
the
lecture
on
st
francis
came
floating
round
the
partition
wall
do
not
let
us
spoil
yours
he
continued
to
lucy
have
you
looked
at
those
saints
yes
said
lucy
they
are
lovely
do
you
know
which
is
the
tombstone
that
is
praised
in
ruskin
he
did
not
know
and
suggested
that
they
should
try
to
guess
it
george
rather
to
her
relief
refused
to
move
and
she
and
the
old
man
wandered
not
unpleasantly
about
santa
croce
which
though
it
is
like
a
barn
has
harvested
many
beautiful
things
inside
its
walls
there
were
also
beggars
to
avoid
and
guides
to
dodge
round
the
pillars
and
an
old
lady
with
her
dog
and
here
and
there
a
priest
modestly
edging
to
his
mass
through
the
groups
of
tourists
but
mr
emerson
was
only
half
interested
he
watched
the
lecturer
whose
success
he
believed
he
had
impaired
and
then
he
anxiously
watched
his
son
why
will
he
look
at
that
fresco
he
said
uneasily
i
saw
nothing
in
it
i
like
giotto
she
replied
it
is
so
wonderful
what
they
say
about
his
tactile
values
though
i
like
things
like
the
della
robbia
babies
better
so
you
ought
a
baby
is
worth
a
dozen
saints
and
my
baby
'
s
worth
the
whole
of
paradise
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
he
lives
in
hell
lucy
again
felt
that
this
did
not
do
in
hell
he
repeated
he
is
unhappy
oh
dear
said
lucy
how
can
he
be
unhappy
when
he
is
strong
and
alive
what
more
is
one
to
give
him
and
think
how
he
has
been
brought
up
free
from
all
the
superstition
and
ignorance
that
lead
men
to
hate
one
another
in
the
name
of
god
with
such
an
education
as
that
i
thought
he
was
bound
to
grow
up
happy
she
was
no
theologian
but
she
felt
that
here
was
a
very
foolish
old
man
as
well
as
a
very
irreligious
one
she
also
felt
that
her
mother
might
not
like
her
talking
to
that
kind
of
person
and
that
charlotte
would
object
most
strongly
what
are
we
to
do
with
him
he
asked
he
comes
out
for
his
holiday
to
italy
and
behaves
like
that
like
the
little
child
who
ought
to
have
been
playing
and
who
hurt
himself
upon
the
tombstone
eh
what
did
you
say
lucy
had
made
no
suggestion
suddenly
he
said
now
do
not
be
stupid
over
this
i
do
not
require
you
to
fall
in
love
with
my
boy
but
i
do
think
you
might
try
and
understand
him
you
are
nearer
his
age
and
if
you
let
yourself
go
i
am
sure
you
are
sensible
you
might
help
me
he
has
known
so
few
women
and
you
have
the
time
you
stop
here
several
weeks
i
suppose
but
let
yourself
go
you
are
inclined
to
get
muddled
if
i
may
judge
from
last
night
let
yourself
go
pull
out
from
the
depths
those
thoughts
that
you
do
not
understand
and
spread
them
out
in
the
sunlight
and
know
the
meaning
of
them
by
understanding
george
you
may
learn
to
understand
yourself
it
will
be
good
for
both
of
you
to
this
extraordinary
speech
lucy
found
no
answer
i
only
know
what
it
is
that
'
s
wrong
with
him
not
why
it
is
and
what
is
it
asked
lucy
fearfully
expecting
some
harrowing
tale
the
old
trouble
things
wo
not
fit
what
things
the
things
of
the
universe
it
is
quite
true
they
do
not
oh
mr
emerson
whatever
do
you
mean
in
his
ordinary
voice
so
that
she
scarcely
realized
he
was
quoting
poetry
he
said
'
from
far
from
eve
and
morning
and
yon
twelve
-
winded
sky
the
stuff
of
life
to
knit
me
blew
hither
here
am
i
'
george
and
i
both
know
this
but
why
does
it
distress
him
we
know
that
we
come
from
the
winds
and
that
we
shall
return
to
them
that
all
life
is
perhaps
a
knot
a
tangle
a
blemish
in
the
eternal
smoothness
but
why
should
this
make
us
unhappy
let
us
rather
love
one
another
and
work
and
rejoice
i
do
not
believe
in
this
world
sorrow
miss
honeychurch
assented
then
make
my
boy
think
like
us
make
him
realize
that
by
the
side
of
the
everlasting
why
there
is
a
yes
a
transitory
yes
if
you
like
but
a
yes
suddenly
she
laughed
surely
one
ought
to
laugh
a
young
man
melancholy
because
the
universe
would
not
fit
because
life
was
a
tangle
or
a
wind
or
a
yes
or
something
i
am
very
sorry
she
cried
you
will
think
me
unfeeling
but
but
then
she
became
matronly
oh
but
your
son
wants
employment
has
he
no
particular
hobby
why
i
myself
have
worries
but
i
can
generally
forget
them
at
the
piano
and
collecting
stamps
did
no
end
of
good
for
my
brother
perhaps
italy
bores
him
you
ought
to
try
the
alps
or
the
lakes
the
old
man
'
s
face
saddened
and
he
touched
her
gently
with
his
hand
this
did
not
alarm
her
she
thought
that
her
advice
had
impressed
him
and
that
he
was
thanking
her
for
it
indeed
he
no
longer
alarmed
her
at
all
she
regarded
him
as
a
kind
thing
but
quite
silly
her
feelings
were
as
inflated
spiritually
as
they
had
been
an
hour
ago
esthetically
before
she
lost
baedeker
the
dear
george
now
striding
towards
them
over
the
tombstones
seemed
both
pitiable
and
absurd
he
approached
his
face
in
the
shadow
he
said
miss
bartlett
oh
good
gracious
me
said
lucy
suddenly
collapsing
and
again
seeing
the
whole
of
life
in
a
new
perspective
where
where
in
the
nave
i
see
those
gossiping
little
miss
alans
must
have
she
checked
herself
poor
girl
exploded
mr
emerson
poor
girl
she
could
not
let
this
pass
for
it
was
just
what
she
was
feeling
herself
poor
girl
i
fail
to
understand
the
point
of
that
remark
i
think
myself
a
very
fortunate
girl
i
assure
you
i
am
thoroughly
happy
and
having
a
splendid
time
pray
do
not
waste
time
mourning
over
me
there
'
s
enough
sorrow
in
the
world
is
not
there
without
trying
to
invent
it
good
-
bye
thank
you
both
so
much
for
all
your
kindness
ah
yes
there
does
come
my
cousin
a
delightful
morning
santa
croce
is
a
wonderful
church
she
joined
her
cousin
it
so
happened
that
lucy
who
found
daily
life
rather
chaotic
entered
a
more
solid
world
when
she
opened
the
piano
she
was
then
no
longer
either
deferential
or
patronizing
no
longer
either
a
rebel
or
a
slave
the
kingdom
of
music
is
not
the
kingdom
of
this
world
it
will
accept
those
whom
breeding
and
intellect
and
culture
have
alike
rejected
the
commonplace
person
begins
to
play
and
shoots
into
the
empyrean
without
effort
whilst
we
look
up
marvelling
how
he
has
escaped
us
and
thinking
how
we
could
worship
him
and
love
him
would
he
but
translate
his
visions
into
human
words
and
his
experiences
into
human
actions
perhaps
he
cannot
certainly
he
does
not
or
does
so
very
seldom
lucy
had
done
so
never
she
was
no
dazzling
executante
her
runs
were
not
at
all
like
strings
of
pearls
and
she
struck
no
more
right
notes
than
was
suitable
for
one
of
her
age
and
situation
nor
was
she
the
passionate
young
lady
who
performs
so
tragically
on
a
summer
'
s
evening
with
the
window
open
passion
was
there
but
it
could
not
be
easily
labelled
it
slipped
between
love
and
hatred
and
jealousy
and
all
the
furniture
of
the
pictorial
style
and
she
was
tragical
only
in
the
sense
that
she
was
great
for
she
loved
to
play
on
the
side
of
victory
victory
of
what
and
over
what
that
is
more
than
the
words
of
daily
life
can
tell
us
but
that
some
sonatas
of
beethoven
are
written
tragic
no
one
can
gainsay
yet
they
can
triumph
or
despair
as
the
player
decides
and
lucy
had
decided
that
they
should
triumph
a
very
wet
afternoon
at
the
bertolini
permitted
her
to
do
the
thing
she
really
liked
and
after
lunch
she
opened
the
little
draped
piano
a
few
people
lingered
round
and
praised
her
playing
but
finding
that
she
made
no
reply
dispersed
to
their
rooms
to
write
up
their
diaries
or
to
sleep
she
took
no
notice
of
mr
emerson
looking
for
his
son
nor
of
miss
bartlett
looking
for
miss
lavish
nor
of
miss
lavish
looking
for
her
cigarette
-
case
like
every
true
performer
she
was
intoxicated
by
the
mere
feel
of
the
notes
they
were
fingers
caressing
her
own
and
by
touch
not
by
sound
alone
did
she
come
to
her
desire
mr
beebe
sitting
unnoticed
in
the
window
pondered
this
illogical
element
in
miss
honeychurch
and
recalled
the
occasion
at
tunbridge
wells
when
he
had
discovered
it
it
was
at
one
of
those
entertainments
where
the
upper
classes
entertain
the
lower
the
seats
were
filled
with
a
respectful
audience
and
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
parish
under
the
auspices
of
their
vicar
sang
or
recited
or
imitated
the
drawing
of
a
champagne
cork
among
the
promised
items
was
miss
honeychurch
piano
beethoven
and
mr
beebe
was
wondering
whether
it
would
be
adelaida
or
the
march
of
the
ruins
of
athens
when
his
composure
was
disturbed
by
the
opening
bars
of
opus
iii
he
was
in
suspense
all
through
the
introduction
for
not
until
the
pace
quickens
does
one
know
what
the
performer
intends
with
the
roar
of
the
opening
theme
he
knew
that
things
were
going
extraordinarily
in
the
chords
that
herald
the
conclusion
he
heard
the
hammer
strokes
of
victory
he
was
glad
that
she
only
played
the
first
movement
for
he
could
have
paid
no
attention
to
the
winding
intricacies
of
the
measures
of
nine
-
sixteen
the
audience
clapped
no
less
respectful
it
was
mr
beebe
who
started
the
stamping
it
was
all
that
one
could
do
who
is
she
he
asked
the
vicar
afterwards
cousin
of
one
of
my
parishioners
i
do
not
consider
her
choice
of
a
piece
happy
beethoven
is
so
usually
simple
and
direct
in
his
appeal
that
it
is
sheer
perversity
to
choose
a
thing
like
that
which
if
anything
disturbs
introduce
me
she
will
be
delighted
she
and
miss
bartlett
are
full
of
the
praises
of
your
sermon
my
sermon
cried
mr
beebe
why
ever
did
she
listen
to
it
when
he
was
introduced
he
understood
why
for
miss
honeychurch
disjoined
from
her
music
stool
was
only
a
young
lady
with
a
quantity
of
dark
hair
and
a
very
pretty
pale
undeveloped
face
she
loved
going
to
concerts
she
loved
stopping
with
her
cousin
she
loved
iced
coffee
and
meringues
he
did
not
doubt
that
she
loved
his
sermon
also
but
before
he
left
tunbridge
wells
he
made
a
remark
to
the
vicar
which
he
now
made
to
lucy
herself
when
she
closed
the
little
piano
and
moved
dreamily
towards
him
if
miss
honeychurch
ever
takes
to
live
as
she
plays
it
will
be
very
exciting
both
for
us
and
for
her
lucy
at
once
re
-
entered
daily
life
oh
what
a
funny
thing
some
one
said
just
the
same
to
mother
and
she
said
she
trusted
i
should
never
live
a
duet
does
not
mrs
honeychurch
like
music
she
does
not
mind
it
but
she
does
not
like
one
to
get
excited
over
anything
she
thinks
i
am
silly
about
it
she
thinks
i
ca
not
make
out
once
you
know
i
said
that
i
liked
my
own
playing
better
than
any
one
'
s
she
has
never
got
over
it
of
course
i
did
not
mean
that
i
played
well
i
only
meant
of
course
said
he
wondering
why
she
bothered
to
explain
music
said
lucy
as
if
attempting
some
generality
she
could
not
complete
it
and
looked
out
absently
upon
italy
in
the
wet
the
whole
life
of
the
south
was
disorganized
and
the
most
graceful
nation
in
europe
had
turned
into
formless
lumps
of
clothes
the
street
and
the
river
were
dirty
yellow
the
bridge
was
dirty
grey
and
the
hills
were
dirty
purple
somewhere
in
their
folds
were
concealed
miss
lavish
and
miss
bartlett
who
had
chosen
this
afternoon
to
visit
the
torre
del
gallo
what
about
music
said
mr
beebe
poor
charlotte
will
be
sopped
was
lucy
'
s
reply
the
expedition
was
typical
of
miss
bartlett
who
would
return
cold
tired
hungry
and
angelic
with
a
ruined
skirt
a
pulpy
baedeker
and
a
tickling
cough
in
her
throat
on
another
day
when
the
whole
world
was
singing
and
the
air
ran
into
the
mouth
like
wine
she
would
refuse
to
stir
from
the
drawing
-
room
saying
that
she
was
an
old
thing
and
no
fit
companion
for
a
hearty
girl
miss
lavish
has
led
your
cousin
astray
she
hopes
to
find
the
true
italy
in
the
wet
i
believe
miss
lavish
is
so
original
murmured
lucy
this
was
a
stock
remark
the
supreme
achievement
of
the
pension
bertolini
in
the
way
of
definition
miss
lavish
was
so
original
mr
beebe
had
his
doubts
but
they
would
have
been
put
down
to
clerical
narrowness
for
that
and
for
other
reasons
he
held
his
peace
is
it
true
continued
lucy
in
awe
-
struck
tone
that
miss
lavish
is
writing
a
book
they
do
say
so
what
is
it
about
it
will
be
a
novel
replied
mr
beebe
dealing
with
modern
italy
let
me
refer
you
for
an
account
to
miss
catharine
alan
who
uses
words
herself
more
admirably
than
any
one
i
know
i
wish
miss
lavish
would
tell
me
herself
we
started
such
friends
but
i
do
not
think
she
ought
to
have
run
away
with
baedeker
that
morning
in
santa
croce
charlotte
was
most
annoyed
at
finding
me
practically
alone
and
so
i
could
not
help
being
a
little
annoyed
with
miss
lavish
the
two
ladies
at
all
events
have
made
it
up
he
was
interested
in
the
sudden
friendship
between
women
so
apparently
dissimilar
as
miss
bartlett
and
miss
lavish
they
were
always
in
each
other
'
s
company
with
lucy
a
slighted
third
miss
lavish
he
believed
he
understood
but
miss
bartlett
might
reveal
unknown
depths
of
strangeness
though
not
perhaps
of
meaning
was
italy
deflecting
her
from
the
path
of
prim
chaperon
which
