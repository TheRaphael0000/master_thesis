i
said
nothing
,
for
i
was
not
inclined
for
mere
politeness
to
him
after
such
very
serious
talk
;
but
in
fact
i
should
liked
to
have
gone
on
talking
with
the
older
man
,
who
could
understand
something
at
least
of
my
wonted
ways
of
looking
at
life
,
whereas
,
with
the
younger
people
,
in
spite
of
all
their
kindness
,
i
really
was
a
being
from
another
planet
.
however
,
i
made
the
best
of
it
,
and
smiled
as
amiably
as
i
could
on
the
young
couple
;
and
dick
returned
the
smile
by
saying
,
"
well
,
guest
,
i
am
glad
to
have
you
again
,
and
to
find
that
you
and
my
kinsman
have
not
quite
talked
yourselves
into
another
world
;
i
was
half
suspecting
as
i
was
listening
to
the
welshmen
yonder
that
you
would
presently
be
vanishing
away
from
us
,
and
began
to
picture
my
kinsman
sitting
in
the
hall
staring
at
nothing
and
finding
that
he
had
been
talking
a
while
past
to
nobody
.
"
i
felt
rather
uncomfortable
at
this
speech
,
for
suddenly
the
picture
of
the
sordid
squabble
,
the
dirty
and
miserable
tragedy
of
the
life
i
had
left
for
a
while
,
came
before
my
eyes
;
and
i
had
,
as
it
were
,
a
vision
of
all
my
longings
for
rest
and
peace
in
the
past
,
and
i
loathed
the
idea
of
going
back
to
it
again
.
but
the
old
man
chuckled
and
said
:
"
do
not
be
afraid
,
dick
.
in
any
case
,
i
have
not
been
talking
to
thin
air
;
nor
,
indeed
to
this
new
friend
of
ours
only
.
who
knows
but
i
may
not
have
been
talking
to
many
people
?
for
perhaps
our
guest
may
some
day
go
back
to
the
people
he
has
come
from
,
and
may
take
a
message
from
us
which
may
bear
fruit
for
them
,
and
consequently
for
us
.
"
dick
looked
puzzled
,
and
said
:
"
well
,
gaffer
,
i
do
not
quite
understand
what
you
mean
.
all
i
can
say
is
,
that
i
hope
he
will
not
leave
us
:
for
do
not
you
see
,
he
is
another
kind
of
man
to
what
we
are
used
to
,
and
somehow
he
makes
us
think
of
all
kind
of
things
;
and
already
i
feel
as
if
i
could
understand
dickens
the
better
for
having
talked
with
him
.
"
"
yes
,
"
said
clara
,
"
and
i
think
in
a
few
months
we
shall
make
him
look
younger
;
and
i
should
like
to
see
what
he
was
like
with
the
wrinkles
smoothed
out
of
his
face
.
do
not
you
think
he
will
look
younger
after
a
little
time
with
us
?
"
the
old
man
shook
his
head
,
and
looked
earnestly
at
me
,
but
did
not
answer
her
,
and
for
a
moment
or
two
we
were
all
silent
.
then
clara
broke
out
:
"
kinsman
,
i
do
not
like
this
:
something
or
another
troubles
me
,
and
i
feel
as
if
something
untoward
were
going
to
happen
.
you
have
been
talking
of
past
miseries
to
the
guest
,
and
have
been
living
in
past
unhappy
times
,
and
it
is
in
the
air
all
round
us
,
and
makes
us
feel
as
if
we
were
longing
for
something
that
we
cannot
have
.
"
the
old
man
smiled
on
her
kindly
,
and
said
:
"
well
,
my
child
,
if
that
be
so
,
go
and
live
in
the
present
,
and
you
will
soon
shake
it
off
.
"
then
he
turned
to
me
,
and
said
:
"
do
you
remember
anything
like
that
,
guest
,
in
the
country
from
which
you
come
?
"
the
lovers
had
turned
aside
now
,
and
were
talking
together
softly
,
and
not
heeding
us
;
so
i
said
,
but
in
a
low
voice
:
"
yes
,
when
i
was
a
happy
child
on
a
sunny
holiday
,
and
had
everything
that
i
could
think
of
.
"
"
so
it
is
,
"
said
he
.
"
you
remember
just
now
you
twitted
me
with
living
in
the
second
childhood
of
the
world
.
you
will
find
it
a
happy
world
to
live
in
;
you
will
be
happy
there
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
a
while
.
"
again
i
did
not
like
his
scarcely
veiled
threat
,
and
was
beginning
to
trouble
myself
with
trying
to
remember
how
i
had
got
amongst
this
curious
people
,
when
the
old
man
called
out
in
a
cheery
voice
:
"
now
,
my
children
,
take
your
guest
away
,
and
make
much
of
him
;
for
it
is
your
business
to
make
him
sleek
of
skin
and
peaceful
of
mind
:
he
has
by
no
means
been
as
lucky
as
you
have
.
farewell
,
guest
!
"
and
he
grasped
my
hand
warmly
.
"
good
-
bye
,
"
said
i
,
"
and
thank
you
very
much
for
all
that
you
have
told
me
.
i
will
come
and
see
you
as
soon
as
i
come
back
to
london
.
may
i
?
"
"
yes
,
"
he
said
,
"
come
by
all
means
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
if
you
can
.
"
"
it
wo
not
be
for
some
time
yet
,
"
quoth
dick
,
in
his
cheery
voice
;
"
for
when
the
hay
is
in
up
the
river
,
i
shall
be
for
taking
him
a
round
through
the
country
between
hay
and
wheat
harvest
,
to
see
how
our
friends
live
in
the
north
country
.
then
in
the
wheat
harvest
we
shall
do
a
good
stroke
of
work
,
i
should
hope
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
wiltshire
by
preference
;
for
he
will
be
getting
a
little
hard
with
all
the
open
-
air
living
,
and
i
shall
be
as
tough
as
nails
.
"
"
but
you
will
take
me
along
,
wo
not
you
,
dick
?
"
said
clara
,
laying
her
pretty
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
"
will
i
not
?
"
said
dick
,
somewhat
boisterously
.
"
and
we
will
manage
to
send
you
to
bed
pretty
tired
every
night
;
and
you
will
look
so
beautiful
with
your
neck
all
brown
,
and
your
hands
too
,
and
you
under
your
gown
as
white
as
privet
,
that
you
will
get
some
of
those
strange
discontented
whims
out
of
your
head
,
my
dear
.
however
,
our
week
'
s
haymaking
will
do
all
that
for
you
.
"
the
girl
reddened
very
prettily
,
and
not
for
shame
but
for
pleasure
;
and
the
old
man
laughed
,
and
said
:
"
guest
,
i
see
that
you
will
be
as
comfortable
as
need
be
;
for
you
need
not
fear
that
those
two
will
be
too
officious
with
you
:
they
will
be
so
busy
with
each
other
,
that
they
will
leave
you
a
good
deal
to
yourself
,
i
am
sure
,
and
that
is
a
real
kindness
to
a
guest
,
after
all
.
o
,
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
being
one
too
many
,
either
:
it
is
just
what
these
birds
in
a
nest
like
,
to
have
a
good
convenient
friend
to
turn
to
,
so
that
they
may
relieve
the
ecstasies
of
love
with
the
solid
commonplace
of
friendship
.
besides
,
dick
,
and
much
more
clara
,
likes
a
little
talking
at
times
;
and
you
know
lovers
do
not
talk
unless
they
get
into
trouble
,
they
only
prattle
.
good
-
bye
,
guest
;
may
you
be
happy
!
"
clara
went
up
to
old
hammond
,
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
him
heartily
,
and
said
:
"
you
are
a
dear
old
man
,
and
may
have
your
jest
about
me
as
much
as
you
please
;
and
it
wo
not
be
long
before
we
see
you
again
;
and
you
may
be
sure
we
shall
make
our
guest
happy
;
though
,
mind
you
,
there
is
some
truth
in
what
you
say
.
"
then
i
shook
hands
again
,
and
we
went
out
of
the
hall
and
into
the
cloisters
,
and
so
in
the
street
found
greylocks
in
the
shafts
waiting
for
us
.
he
was
well
looked
after
;
for
a
little
lad
of
about
seven
years
old
had
his
hand
on
the
rein
and
was
solemnly
looking
up
into
his
face
;
on
his
back
,
withal
,
was
a
girl
of
fourteen
,
holding
a
three
-
year
old
sister
on
before
her
;
while
another
girl
,
about
a
year
older
than
the
boy
,
hung
on
behind
.
the
three
were
occupied
partly
with
eating
cherries
,
partly
with
patting
and
punching
greylocks
,
who
took
all
their
caresses
in
good
part
,
but
pricked
up
his
ears
when
dick
made
his
appearance
.
the
girls
got
off
quietly
,
and
going
up
to
clara
,
made
much
of
her
and
snuggled
up
to
her
.
and
then
we
got
into
the
carriage
,
dick
shook
the
reins
,
and
we
got
under
way
at
once
,
greylocks
trotting
soberly
between
the
lovely
trees
of
the
london
streets
,
that
were
sending
floods
of
fragrance
into
the
cool
evening
air
;
for
it
was
now
getting
toward
sunset
.
we
could
hardly
go
but
fair
and
softly
all
the
way
,
as
there
were
a
great
many
people
abroad
in
that
cool
hour
.
seeing
so
many
people
made
me
notice
their
looks
the
more
;
and
i
must
say
,
my
taste
,
cultivated
in
the
sombre
greyness
,
or
rather
brownness
,
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
was
rather
apt
to
condemn
the
gaiety
and
brightness
of
the
raiment
;
and
i
even
ventured
to
say
as
much
to
clara
.
she
seemed
rather
surprised
,
and
even
slightly
indignant
,
and
said
:
"
well
,
well
,
what
'
s
the
matter
?
they
are
not
about
any
dirty
work
;
they
are
only
amusing
themselves
in
the
fine
evening
;
there
is
nothing
to
foul
their
clothes
.
come
,
does
not
it
all
look
very
pretty
?
it
is
not
gaudy
,
you
know
.
"
indeed
that
was
true
;
for
many
of
the
people
were
clad
in
colours
that
were
sober
enough
,
though
beautiful
,
and
the
harmony
of
the
colours
was
perfect
and
most
delightful
.
i
said
,
"
yes
,
that
is
so
;
but
how
can
everybody
afford
such
costly
garments
?
look
!
there
goes
a
middle
-
aged
man
in
a
sober
grey
dress
;
but
i
can
see
from
here
that
it
is
made
of
very
fine
woollen
stuff
,
and
is
covered
with
silk
embroidery
.
"
said
clara
:
"
he
could
wear
shabby
clothes
if
he
pleased
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
is
,
if
he
did
not
think
he
would
hurt
people
'
s
feelings
by
doing
so
.
"
"
but
please
tell
me
,
"
said
i
,
"
how
can
they
afford
it
?
"
as
soon
as
i
had
spoken
i
perceived
that
i
had
got
back
to
my
old
blunder
;
for
i
saw
dick
'
s
shoulders
shaking
with
laughter
;
but
he
would
not
say
a
word
,
but
handed
me
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
clara
,
who
said
-
"
why
,
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
.
of
course
we
can
afford
it
,
or
else
we
should
not
do
it
.
it
would
be
easy
enough
for
us
to
say
,
we
will
only
spend
our
labour
on
making
our
clothes
comfortable
:
but
we
do
not
choose
to
stop
there
.
why
do
you
find
fault
with
us
?
does
it
seem
to
you
as
if
we
starved
ourselves
of
food
in
order
to
make
ourselves
fine
clothes
?
or
do
you
think
there
is
anything
wrong
in
liking
to
see
the
coverings
of
our
bodies
beautiful
like
our
bodies
are
?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
just
as
a
deer
'
s
or
an
otter
'
s
skin
has
been
made
beautiful
from
the
first
?
come
,
what
is
wrong
with
you
?
"
i
bowed
before
the
storm
,
and
mumbled
out
some
excuse
or
other
.
i
must
say
,
i
might
have
known
that
people
who
were
so
fond
of
architecture
generally
,
would
not
be
backward
in
ornamenting
themselves
;
all
the
more
as
the
shape
of
their
raiment
,
apart
from
its
colour
,
was
both
beautiful
and
reasonable
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
veiling
the
form
,
without
either
muffling
or
caricaturing
it
.
clara
was
soon
mollified
;
and
as
we
drove
along
toward
the
wood
before
mentioned
,
she
said
to
dick
-
"
i
tell
you
what
,
dick
:
now
that
kinsman
hammond
the
elder
has
seen
our
guest
in
his
queer
clothes
,
i
think
we
ought
to
find
him
something
decent
to
put
on
for
our
journey
to
-
morrow
:
especially
since
,
if
we
do
not
,
we
shall
have
to
answer
all
sorts
of
questions
as
to
his
clothes
and
where
they
came
from
.
besides
,
"
she
said
slily
,
"
when
he
is
clad
in
handsome
garments
he
will
not
be
so
quick
to
blame
us
for
our
childishness
in
wasting
our
time
in
making
ourselves
look
pleasant
to
each
other
.
"
"
all
right
,
clara
,
"
said
dick
;
"
he
shall
have
everything
that
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
he
wants
to
have
.
i
will
look
something
out
for
him
before
he
gets
up
to
-
morrow
.
"
amidst
such
talk
,
driving
quietly
through
the
balmy
evening
,
we
came
to
hammersmith
,
and
were
well
received
by
our
friends
there
.
boffin
,
in
a
fresh
suit
of
clothes
,
welcomed
me
back
with
stately
courtesy
;
the
weaver
wanted
to
button
-
hole
me
and
get
out
of
me
what
old
hammond
had
said
,
but
was
very
friendly
and
cheerful
when
dick
warned
him
off
;
annie
shook
hands
with
me
,
and
hoped
i
had
had
a
pleasant
day
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
so
kindly
,
that
i
felt
a
slight
pang
as
our
hands
parted
;
for
to
say
the
truth
,
i
liked
her
better
than
clara
,
who
seemed
to
be
always
a
little
on
the
defensive
,
whereas
annie
was
as
frank
as
could
be
,
and
seemed
to
get
honest
pleasure
from
everything
and
everybody
about
her
without
the
least
effort
.
we
had
quite
a
little
feast
that
evening
,
partly
in
my
honour
,
and
partly
,
i
suspect
,
though
nothing
was
said
about
it
,
in
honour
of
dick
and
clara
coming
together
again
.
the
wine
was
of
the
best
;
the
hall
was
redolent
of
rich
summer
flowers
;
and
after
supper
we
not
only
had
music
(
annie
,
to
my
mind
,
surpassing
all
the
others
for
sweetness
and
clearness
of
voice
,
as
well
as
for
feeling
and
meaning
)
,
but
at
last
we
even
got
to
telling
stories
,
and
sat
there
listening
,
with
no
other
light
but
that
of
the
summer
moon
streaming
through
the
beautiful
traceries
of
the
windows
,
as
if
we
had
belonged
to
time
long
passed
,
when
books
were
scarce
and
the
art
of
reading
somewhat
rare
.
indeed
,
i
may
say
here
,
that
,
though
,
as
you
will
have
noted
,
my
friends
had
mostly
something
to
say
about
books
,
yet
they
were
not
great
readers
,
considering
the
refinement
of
their
manners
and
the
great
amount
of
leisure
which
they
obviously
had
.
in
fact
,
when
dick
,
especially
,
mentioned
a
book
,
he
did
so
with
an
air
of
a
man
who
has
accomplished
an
achievement
;
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
there
,
you
see
,
i
have
actually
read
that
!
"
the
evening
passed
all
too
quickly
for
me
;
since
that
day
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
i
was
having
my
fill
of
the
pleasure
of
the
eyes
without
any
of
that
sense
of
incongruity
,
that
dread
of
approaching
ruin
,
which
had
always
beset
me
hitherto
when
i
had
been
amongst
the
beautiful
works
of
art
of
the
past
,
mingled
with
the
lovely
nature
of
the
present
;
both
of
them
,
in
fact
,
the
result
of
the
long
centuries
of
tradition
,
which
had
compelled
men
to
produce
the
art
,
and
compelled
nature
to
run
into
the
mould
of
the
ages
.
here
i
could
enjoy
everything
without
an
afterthought
of
the
injustice
and
miserable
toil
which
made
my
leisure
;
the
ignorance
and
dulness
of
life
which
went
to
make
my
keen
appreciation
of
history
;
the
tyranny
and
the
struggle
full
of
fear
and
mishap
which
went
to
make
my
romance
.
the
only
weight
i
had
upon
my
heart
was
a
vague
fear
as
it
drew
toward
bed
-
time
concerning
the
place
wherein
i
should
wake
on
the
morrow
:
but
i
choked
that
down
,
and
went
to
bed
happy
,
and
in
a
very
few
moments
was
in
a
dreamless
sleep
.
when
i
did
wake
,
to
a
beautiful
sunny
morning
,
i
leapt
out
of
bed
with
my
over
-
night
apprehension
still
clinging
to
me
,
which
vanished
delightfully
however
in
a
moment
as
i
looked
around
my
little
sleeping
chamber
and
saw
the
pale
but
pure
-
coloured
figures
painted
on
the
plaster
of
the
wall
,
with
verses
written
underneath
them
which
i
knew
somewhat
over
well
.
i
dressed
speedily
,
in
a
suit
of
blue
laid
ready
for
me
,
so
handsome
that
i
quite
blushed
when
i
had
got
into
it
,
feeling
as
i
did
so
that
excited
pleasure
of
anticipation
of
a
holiday
,
which
,
well
remembered
as
it
was
,
i
had
not
felt
since
i
was
a
boy
,
new
come
home
for
the
summer
holidays
.
it
seemed
quite
early
in
the
morning
,
and
i
expected
to
have
the
hall
to
myself
when
i
came
into
it
out
of
the
corridor
wherein
was
my
sleeping
chamber
;
but
i
met
annie
at
once
,
who
let
fall
her
broom
and
gave
me
a
kiss
,
quite
meaningless
i
fear
,
except
as
betokening
friendship
,
though
she
reddened
as
she
did
it
,
not
from
shyness
,
but
from
friendly
pleasure
,
and
then
stood
and
picked
up
her
broom
again
,
and
went
on
with
her
sweeping
,
nodding
to
me
as
if
to
bid
me
stand
out
of
the
way
and
look
on
;
which
,
to
say
the
truth
,
i
thought
amusing
enough
,
as
there
were
five
other
girls
helping
her
,
and
their
graceful
figures
engaged
in
the
leisurely
work
were
worth
going
a
long
way
to
see
,
and
their
merry
talk
and
laughing
as
they
swept
in
quite
a
scientific
manner
was
worth
going
a
long
way
to
hear
.
but
annie
presently
threw
me
back
a
word
or
two
as
she
went
on
to
the
other
end
of
the
hall
:
"
guest
,
"
she
said
,
"
i
am
glad
that
you
are
up
early
,
though
we
would
not
disturb
you
;
for
our
thames
is
a
lovely
river
at
half
-
past
six
on
a
june
morning
:
and
as
it
would
be
a
pity
for
you
to
lose
it
,
i
am
told
just
to
give
you
a
cup
of
milk
and
a
bit
of
bread
outside
there
,
and
put
you
into
the
boat
:
for
dick
and
clara
are
all
ready
now
.
wait
half
a
minute
till
i
have
swept
down
this
row
.
"
so
presently
she
let
her
broom
drop
again
,
and
came
and
took
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
out
on
to
the
terrace
above
the
river
,
to
a
little
table
under
the
boughs
,
where
my
bread
and
milk
took
the
form
of
as
dainty
a
breakfast
as
any
one
could
desire
,
and
then
sat
by
me
as
i
ate
.
and
in
a
minute
or
two
dick
and
clara
came
to
me
,
the
latter
looking
most
fresh
and
beautiful
in
a
light
silk
embroidered
gown
,
which
to
my
unused
eyes
was
extravagantly
gay
and
bright
;
while
dick
was
also
handsomely
dressed
in
white
flannel
prettily
embroidered
.
clara
raised
her
gown
in
her
hands
as
she
gave
me
the
morning
greeting
,
and
said
laughingly
:
"
look
,
guest
!
you
see
we
are
at
least
as
fine
as
any
of
the
people
you
felt
inclined
to
scold
last
night
;
you
see
we
are
not
going
to
make
the
bright
day
and
the
flowers
feel
ashamed
of
themselves
.
now
scold
me
!
"
quoth
i
:
"
no
,
indeed
;
the
pair
of
you
seem
as
if
you
were
born
out
of
the
summer
day
itself
;
and
i
will
scold
you
when
i
scold
it
.
"
"
well
,
you
know
,
"
said
dick
,
"
this
is
a
special
day
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
all
these
days
are
,
i
mean
.
the
hay
-
harvest
is
in
some
ways
better
than
corn
-
harvest
because
of
the
beautiful
weather
;
and
really
,
unless
you
had
worked
in
the
hay
-
field
in
fine
weather
,
you
could
not
tell
what
pleasant
work
it
is
.
the
women
look
so
pretty
at
it
,
too
,
"
he
said
,
shyly
;
"
so
all
things
considered
,
i
think
we
are
right
to
adorn
it
in
a
simple
manner
.
"
"
do
the
women
work
at
it
in
silk
dresses
?
"
said
i
,
smiling
.
dick
was
going
to
answer
me
soberly
;
but
clara
put
her
hand
over
his
mouth
,
and
said
,
"
no
,
no
,
dick
;
not
too
much
information
for
him
,
or
i
shall
think
that
you
are
your
old
kinsman
again
.
let
him
find
out
for
himself
:
he
will
not
have
long
to
wait
.
"
"
yes
,
"
quoth
annie
,
"
do
not
make
your
description
of
the
picture
too
fine
,
or
else
he
will
be
disappointed
when
the
curtain
is
drawn
.
i
do
not
want
him
to
be
disappointed
.
but
now
it
is
time
for
you
to
be
gone
,
if
you
are
to
have
the
best
of
the
tide
,
and
also
of
the
sunny
morning
.
good
-
bye
,
guest
.
"
she
kissed
me
in
her
frank
friendly
way
,
and
almost
took
away
from
me
my
desire
for
the
expedition
thereby
;
but
i
had
to
get
over
that
,
as
it
was
clear
that
so
delightful
a
woman
would
hardly
be
without
a
due
lover
of
her
own
age
.
we
went
down
the
steps
of
the
landing
stage
,
and
got
into
a
pretty
boat
,
not
too
light
to
hold
us
and
our
belongings
comfortably
,
and
handsomely
ornamented
;
and
just
as
we
got
in
,
down
came
boffin
and
the
weaver
to
see
us
off
.
the
former
had
now
veiled
his
splendour
in
a
due
suit
of
working
clothes
,
crowned
with
a
fantail
hat
,
which
he
took
off
,
however
,
to
wave
us
farewell
with
his
grave
old
-
spanish
-
like
courtesy
.
then
dick
pushed
off
into
the
stream
,
and
bent
vigorously
to
his
sculls
,
and
hammersmith
,
with
its
noble
trees
and
beautiful
water
-
side
houses
,
began
to
slip
away
from
us
.
as
we
went
,
i
could
not
help
putting
beside
his
promised
picture
of
the
hay
-
field
as
it
was
then
the
picture
of
it
as
i
remembered
it
,
and
especially
the
images
of
the
women
engaged
in
the
work
rose
up
before
me
:
the
row
of
gaunt
figures
,
lean
,
flat
-
breasted
,
ugly
,
without
a
grace
of
form
or
face
about
them
;
dressed
in
wretched
skimpy
print
gowns
,
and
hideous
flapping
sun
-
bonnets
,
moving
their
rakes
in
a
listless
mechanical
way
.
how
often
had
that
marred
the
loveliness
of
the
june
day
to
me
;
how
often
had
i
longed
to
see
the
hay
-
fields
peopled
with
men
and
women
worthy
of
the
sweet
abundance
of
midsummer
,
of
its
endless
wealth
of
beautiful
sights
,
and
delicious
sounds
and
scents
.
and
now
,
the
world
had
grown
old
and
wiser
,
and
i
was
to
see
my
hope
realised
at
last
!
so
on
we
went
,
dick
rowing
in
an
easy
tireless
way
,
and
clara
sitting
by
my
side
admiring
his
manly
beauty
and
heartily
good
-
natured
face
,
and
thinking
,
i
fancy
,
of
nothing
else
.
as
we
went
higher
up
the
river
,
there
was
less
difference
between
the
thames
of
that
day
and
thames
as
i
remembered
it
;
for
setting
aside
the
hideous
vulgarity
of
the
cockney
villas
of
the
well
-
to
-
do
,
stockbrokers
and
other
such
,
which
in
older
time
marred
the
beauty
of
the
bough
-
hung
banks
,
even
this
beginning
of
the
country
thames
was
always
beautiful
;
and
as
we
slipped
between
the
lovely
summer
greenery
,
i
almost
felt
my
youth
come
back
to
me
,
and
as
if
i
were
on
one
of
those
water
excursions
which
i
used
to
enjoy
so
much
in
days
when
i
was
too
happy
to
think
that
there
could
be
much
amiss
anywhere
.
at
last
we
came
to
a
reach
of
the
river
where
on
the
left
hand
a
very
pretty
little
village
with
some
old
houses
in
it
came
down
to
the
edge
of
the
water
,
over
which
was
a
ferry
;
and
beyond
these
houses
the
elm
-
beset
meadows
ended
in
a
fringe
of
tall
willows
,
while
on
the
right
hand
went
the
tow
-
path
and
a
clear
space
before
a
row
of
trees
,
which
rose
up
behind
huge
and
ancient
,
the
ornaments
of
a
great
park
:
but
these
drew
back
still
further
from
the
river
at
the
end
of
the
reach
to
make
way
for
a
little
town
of
quaint
and
pretty
houses
,
some
new
,
some
old
,
dominated
by
the
long
walls
and
sharp
gables
of
a
great
red
-
brick
pile
of
building
,
partly
of
the
latest
gothic
,
partly
of
the
court
-
style
of
dutch
william
,
but
so
blended
together
by
the
bright
sun
and
beautiful
surroundings
,
including
the
bright
blue
river
,
which
it
looked
down
upon
,
that
even
amidst
the
beautiful
buildings
of
that
new
happy
time
it
had
a
strange
charm
about
it
.
a
great
wave
of
fragrance
,
amidst
which
the
lime
-
tree
blossom
was
clearly
to
be
distinguished
,
came
down
to
us
from
its
unseen
gardens
,
as
clara
sat
up
in
her
place
,
and
said
:
"
o
dick
,
dear
,
could
not
we
stop
at
hampton
court
for
to
-
day
,
and
take
the
guest
about
the
park
a
little
,
and
show
him
those
sweet
old
buildings
?
somehow
,
i
suppose
because
you
have
lived
so
near
it
,
you
have
seldom
taken
me
to
hampton
court
.
"
dick
rested
on
his
oars
a
little
,
and
said
:
"
well
,
well
,
clara
,
you
are
lazy
to
-
day
.
i
did
not
feel
like
stopping
short
of
shepperton
for
the
night
;
suppose
we
just
go
and
have
our
dinner
at
the
court
,
and
go
on
again
about
five
o
'
clock
?
"
"
well
,
"
she
said
,
"
so
be
it
;
but
i
should
like
the
guest
to
have
spent
an
hour
or
two
in
the
park
.
"
"
the
park
!
"
said
dick
;
"
why
,
the
whole
thames
-
side
is
a
park
this
time
of
the
year
;
and
for
my
part
,
i
had
rather
lie
under
an
elm
-
tree
on
the
borders
of
a
wheat
-
field
,
with
the
bees
humming
about
me
and
the
corn
-
crake
crying
from
furrow
to
furrow
,
than
in
any
park
in
england
.
besides
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
besides
,
"
said
she
,
"
you
want
to
get
on
to
your
dearly
-
loved
upper
thames
,
and
show
your
prowess
down
the
heavy
swathes
of
the
mowing
grass
.
"
she
looked
at
him
fondly
,
and
i
could
tell
that
she
was
seeing
him
in
her
mind
'
s
eye
showing
his
splendid
form
at
its
best
amidst
the
rhymed
strokes
of
the
scythes
;
and
she
looked
down
at
her
own
pretty
feet
with
a
half
sigh
,
as
though
she
were
contrasting
her
slight
woman
'
s
beauty
with
his
man
'
s
beauty
;
as
women
will
when
they
are
really
in
love
,
and
are
not
spoiled
with
conventional
sentiment
.
as
for
dick
,
he
looked
at
her
admiringly
a
while
,
and
then
said
at
last
:
"
well
,
clara
,
i
do
wish
we
were
there
!
but
,
hilloa
!
we
are
getting
back
way
.
"
and
he
set
to
work
sculling
again
,
and
in
two
minutes
we
were
all
standing
on
the
gravelly
strand
below
the
bridge
,
which
,
as
you
may
imagine
,
was
no
longer
the
old
hideous
iron
abortion
,
but
a
handsome
piece
of
very
solid
oak
framing
.
we
went
into
the
court
and
straight
into
the
great
hall
,
so
well
remembered
,
where
there
were
tables
spread
for
dinner
,
and
everything
arranged
much
as
in
hammersmith
guest
-
hall
.
dinner
over
,
we
sauntered
through
the
ancient
rooms
,
where
the
pictures
and
tapestry
were
still
preserved
,
and
nothing
was
much
changed
,
except
that
the
people
whom
we
met
there
had
an
indefinable
kind
of
look
of
being
at
home
and
at
ease
,
which
communicated
itself
to
me
,
so
that
i
felt
that
the
beautiful
old
place
was
mine
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
;
and
my
pleasure
of
past
days
seemed
to
add
itself
to
that
of
to
-
day
,
and
filled
my
whole
soul
with
content
.
dick
(
who
,
in
spite
of
clara
'
s
gibe
,
knew
the
place
very
well
)
told
me
that
the
beautiful
old
tudor
rooms
,
which
i
remembered
had
been
the
dwellings
of
the
lesser
fry
of
court
flunkies
,
were
now
much
used
by
people
coming
and
going
;
for
,
beautiful
as
architecture
had
now
become
,
and
although
the
whole
face
of
the
country
had
quite
recovered
its
beauty
,
there
was
still
a
sort
of
tradition
of
pleasure
and
beauty
which
clung
to
that
group
of
buildings
,
and
people
thought
going
to
hampton
court
a
necessary
summer
outing
,
as
they
did
in
the
days
when
london
was
so
grimy
and
miserable
.
we
went
into
some
of
the
rooms
looking
into
the
old
garden
,
and
were
well
received
by
the
people
in
them
,
who
got
speedily
into
talk
with
us
,
and
looked
with
politely
half
-
concealed
wonder
at
my
strange
face
.
besides
these
birds
of
passage
,
and
a
few
regular
dwellers
in
the
place
,
we
saw
out
in
the
meadows
near
the
garden
,
down
"
the
long
water
,
"
as
it
used
to
be
called
,
many
gay
tents
with
men
,
women
,
and
children
round
about
them
.
as
it
seemed
,
this
pleasure
-
loving
people
were
fond
of
tent
-
life
,
with
all
its
inconveniences
,
which
,
indeed
,
they
turned
into
pleasure
also
.
we
left
this
old
friend
by
the
time
appointed
,
and
i
made
some
feeble
show
of
taking
the
sculls
;
but
dick
repulsed
me
,
not
much
to
my
grief
,
i
must
say
,
as
i
found
i
had
quite
enough
to
do
between
the
enjoyment
of
the
beautiful
time
and
my
own
lazily
blended
thoughts
.
as
to
dick
,
it
was
quite
right
to
let
him
pull
,
for
he
was
as
strong
as
a
horse
,
and
had
the
greatest
delight
in
bodily
exercise
,
whatever
it
was
.
we
really
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
him
to
stop
when
it
was
getting
rather
more
than
dusk
,
and
the
moon
was
brightening
just
as
we
were
off
runnymede
.
we
landed
there
,
and
were
looking
about
for
a
place
whereon
to
pitch
our
tents
(
for
we
had
brought
two
with
us
)
,
when
an
old
man
came
up
to
us
,
bade
us
good
evening
,
and
asked
if
we
were
housed
for
that
that
night
;
and
finding
that
we
were
not
,
bade
us
home
to
his
house
.
nothing
loth
,
we
went
with
him
,
and
clara
took
his
hand
in
a
coaxing
way
which
i
noticed
she
used
with
old
men
;
and
as
we
went
on
our
way
,
made
some
commonplace
remark
about
the
beauty
of
the
day
.
the
old
man
stopped
short
,
and
looked
at
her
and
said
:
"
you
really
like
it
then
?
"
"
yes
,
"
she
said
,
looking
very
much
astonished
,
"
do
not
you
?
"
"
well
,
"
said
he
,
"
perhaps
i
do
.
i
did
,
at
any
rate
,
when
i
was
younger
;
but
now
i
think
i
should
like
it
cooler
.
"
she
said
nothing
,
and
went
on
,
the
night
growing
about
as
dark
as
it
would
be
;
till
just
at
the
rise
of
the
hill
we
came
to
a
hedge
with
a
gate
in
it
,
which
the
old
man
unlatched
and
led
us
into
a
garden
,
at
the
end
of
which
we
could
see
a
little
house
,
one
of
whose
little
windows
was
already
yellow
with
candlelight
.
we
could
see
even
under
the
doubtful
light
of
the
moon
and
the
last
of
the
western
glow
that
the
garden
was
stuffed
full
of
flowers
;
and
the
fragrance
it
gave
out
in
the
gathering
coolness
was
so
wonderfully
sweet
,
that
it
seemed
the
very
heart
of
the
delight
of
the
june
dusk
;
so
that
we
three
stopped
instinctively
,
and
clara
gave
forth
a
little
sweet
"
o
,
"
like
a
bird
beginning
to
sing
.
"
what
'
s
the
matter
?
"
said
the
old
man
,
a
little
testily
,
and
pulling
at
her
hand
.
"
there
'
s
no
dog
;
or
have
you
trodden
on
a
thorn
and
hurt
your
foot
?
"
"
no
,
no
,
neighbour
,
"
she
said
;
"
but
how
sweet
,
how
sweet
it
is
!
"
"
of
course
it
is
,
"
said
he
,
"
but
do
you
care
so
much
for
that
?
"
she
laughed
out
musically
,
and
we
followed
suit
in
our
gruffer
voices
;
and
then
she
said
:
"
of
course
i
do
,
neighbour
;
do
not
you
?
"
"
well
,
i
do
not
know
,
"
quoth
the
old
fellow
;
then
he
added
,
as
if
somewhat
ashamed
of
himself
:
"
besides
,
you
know
,
when
the
waters
are
out
and
all
runnymede
is
flooded
,
it
is
none
so
pleasant
.
"
"
_
i
_
should
like
it
,
"
quoth
dick
.
"
what
a
jolly
sail
one
would
get
about
here
on
the
floods
on
a
bright
frosty
january
morning
!
"
"
would
you
like
it
?
"
said
our
host
.
"
well
,
i
wo
not
argue
with
you
,
neighbour
;
it
is
not
worth
while
.
come
in
and
have
some
supper
.
"
we
went
up
a
paved
path
between
the
roses
,
and
straight
into
a
very
pretty
room
,
panelled
and
carved
,
and
as
clean
as
a
new
pin
;
but
the
chief
ornament
of
which
was
a
young
woman
,
light
-
haired
and
grey
-
eyed
,
but
with
her
face
and
hands
and
bare
feet
tanned
quite
brown
with
the
sun
.
though
she
was
very
lightly
clad
,
that
was
clearly
from
choice
,
not
from
poverty
,
though
these
were
the
first
cottage
-
dwellers
i
had
come
across
;
for
her
gown
was
of
silk
,
and
on
her
wrists
were
bracelets
that
seemed
to
me
of
great
value
.
she
was
lying
on
a
sheep
-
skin
near
the
window
,
but
jumped
up
as
soon
as
we
entered
,
and
when
she
saw
the
guests
behind
the
old
man
,
she
clapped
her
hands
and
cried
out
with
pleasure
,
and
when
she
got
us
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
fairly
danced
round
us
in
delight
of
our
company
.
"
what
!
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
you
are
pleased
,
are
you
,
ellen
?
"
the
girl
danced
up
to
him
and
threw
her
arms
round
him
,
and
said
:
"
yes
i
am
,
and
so
ought
you
to
be
grandfather
.
"
"
well
,
well
,
i
am
,
"
said
he
,
"
as
much
as
i
can
be
pleased
.
guests
,
please
be
seated
.
"
this
seemed
rather
strange
to
us
;
stranger
,
i
suspect
,
to
my
friends
than
to
me
;
but
dick
took
the
opportunity
of
both
the
host
and
his
grand
-
daughter
being
out
of
the
room
to
say
to
me
,
softly
:
"
a
grumbler
:
there
are
a
few
of
them
still
.
once
upon
a
time
,
i
am
told
,
they
were
quite
a
nuisance
.
"
the
old
man
came
in
as
he
spoke
and
sat
down
beside
us
with
a
sigh
,
which
,
indeed
,
seemed
fetched
up
as
if
he
wanted
us
to
take
notice
of
it
;
but
just
then
the
girl
came
in
with
the
victuals
,
and
the
carle
missed
his
mark
,
what
between
our
hunger
generally
and
that
i
was
pretty
busy
watching
the
grand
-
daughter
moving
about
as
beautiful
as
a
picture
.
everything
to
eat
and
drink
,
though
it
was
somewhat
different
to
what
we
had
had
in
london
,
was
better
than
good
,
but
the
old
man
eyed
rather
sulkily
the
chief
dish
on
the
table
,
on
which
lay
a
leash
of
fine
perch
,
and
said
:
"
h
'
m
,
perch
!
i
am
sorry
we
ca
not
do
better
for
you
,
guests
.
the
time
was
when
we
might
have
had
a
good
piece
of
salmon
up
from
london
for
you
;
but
the
times
have
grown
mean
and
petty
.
"
"
yes
,
but
you
might
have
had
it
now
,
"
said
the
girl
,
giggling
,
"
if
you
had
known
that
they
were
coming
.
"
"
it
is
our
fault
for
not
bringing
it
with
us
,
neighbours
,
"
said
dick
,
good
-
humouredly
.
"
but
if
the
times
have
grown
petty
,
at
any
rate
the
perch
haven
'
t
;
that
fellow
in
the
middle
there
must
have
weighed
a
good
two
pounds
when
he
was
showing
his
dark
stripes
and
red
fins
to
the
minnows
yonder
.
and
as
to
the
salmon
,
why
,
neighbour
,
my
friend
here
,
who
comes
from
the
outlands
,
was
quite
surprised
yesterday
morning
when
i
told
him
we
had
plenty
of
salmon
at
hammersmith
.
i
am
sure
i
have
heard
nothing
of
the
times
worsening
.
"
he
looked
a
little
uncomfortable
.
and
the
old
man
,
turning
to
me
,
said
very
courteously
:
"
well
,
sir
,
i
am
happy
to
see
a
man
from
over
the
water
;
but
i
really
must
appeal
to
you
to
say
whether
on
the
whole
you
are
not
better
off
in
your
country
;
where
i
suppose
,
from
what
our
guest
says
,
you
are
brisker
and
more
alive
,
because
you
have
not
wholly
got
rid
of
competition
.
you
see
,
i
have
read
not
a
few
books
of
the
past
days
,
and
certainly
they
are
much
more
alive
than
those
which
are
written
now
;
and
good
sound
unlimited
competition
was
the
condition
under
which
they
were
written
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
if
we
did
not
know
that
from
the
record
of
history
,
we
should
know
it
from
the
books
themselves
.
there
is
a
spirit
of
adventure
in
them
,
and
signs
of
a
capacity
to
extract
good
out
of
evil
which
our
literature
quite
lacks
now
;
and
i
cannot
help
thinking
that
our
moralists
and
historians
exaggerate
hugely
the
unhappiness
of
the
past
days
,
in
which
such
splendid
works
of
imagination
and
intellect
were
produced
.
"
clara
listened
to
him
with
restless
eyes
,
as
if
she
were
excited
and
pleased
;
dick
knitted
his
brow
and
looked
still
more
uncomfortable
,
but
said
nothing
.
indeed
,
the
old
man
gradually
,
as
he
warmed
to
his
subject
,
dropped
his
sneering
manner
,
and
both
spoke
and
looked
very
seriously
.
but
the
girl
broke
out
before
i
could
deliver
myself
of
the
answer
i
was
framing
:
"
books
,
books
!
always
books
,
grandfather
!
when
will
you
understand
that
after
all
it
is
the
world
we
live
in
which
interests
us
;
the
world
of
which
we
are
a
part
,
and
which
we
can
never
love
too
much
?
look
!
"
she
said
,
throwing
open
the
casement
wider
and
showing
us
the
white
light
sparkling
between
the
black
shadows
of
the
moonlit
garden
,
through
which
ran
a
little
shiver
of
the
summer
night
-
wind
,
"
look
!
these
are
our
books
in
these
days
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
these
,
"
she
said
,
stepping
lightly
up
to
the
two
lovers
and
laying
a
hand
on
each
of
their
shoulders
;
"
and
the
guest
there
,
with
his
over
-
sea
knowledge
and
experience
;
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
yes
,
and
even
you
,
grandfather
"
(
a
smile
ran
over
her
face
as
she
spoke
)
,
"
with
all
your
grumbling
and
wishing
yourself
back
again
in
the
good
old
days
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
which
,
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
,
a
harmless
and
lazy
old
man
like
you
would
either
have
pretty
nearly
starved
,
or
have
had
to
pay
soldiers
and
people
to
take
the
folk
'
s
victuals
and
clothes
and
houses
away
from
them
by
force
.
yes
,
these
are
our
books
;
and
if
we
want
more
,
can
we
not
find
work
to
do
in
the
beautiful
buildings
that
we
raise
up
all
over
the
country
(
and
i
know
there
was
nothing
like
them
in
past
times
)
,
wherein
a
man
can
put
forth
whatever
is
in
him
,
and
make
his
hands
set
forth
his
mind
and
his
soul
.
"
she
paused
a
little
,
and
i
for
my
part
could
not
help
staring
at
her
,
and
thinking
that
if
she
were
a
book
,
the
pictures
in
it
were
most
lovely
.
the
colour
mantled
in
her
delicate
sunburnt
cheeks
;
her
grey
eyes
,
light
amidst
the
tan
of
her
face
,
kindly
looked
on
us
all
as
she
spoke
.
she
paused
,
and
said
again
:
"
as
for
your
books
,
they
were
well
enough
for
times
when
intelligent
people
had
but
little
else
in
which
they
could
take
pleasure
,
and
when
they
must
needs
supplement
the
sordid
miseries
of
their
own
lives
with
imaginations
of
the
lives
of
other
people
.
but
i
say
flatly
that
in
spite
of
all
their
cleverness
and
vigour
,
and
capacity
for
story
-
telling
,
there
is
something
loathsome
about
them
.
some
of
them
,
indeed
,
do
here
and
there
show
some
feeling
for
those
whom
the
history
-
books
call
'
poor
,
'
and
of
the
misery
of
whose
lives
we
have
some
inkling
;
but
presently
they
give
it
up
,
and
towards
the
end
of
the
story
we
must
be
contented
to
see
the
hero
and
heroine
living
happily
in
an
island
of
bliss
on
other
people
'
s
troubles
;
and
that
after
a
long
series
of
sham
troubles
(
or
mostly
sham
)
of
their
own
making
,
illustrated
by
dreary
introspective
nonsense
about
their
feelings
and
aspirations
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
;
while
the
world
must
even
then
have
gone
on
its
way
,
and
dug
and
sewed
and
baked
and
built
and
carpentered
round
about
these
useless
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
animals
.
"
"
there
!
"
said
the
old
man
,
reverting
to
his
dry
sulky
manner
again
.
"
there
'
s
eloquence
!
i
suppose
you
like
it
?
"
"
yes
,
"
said
i
,
very
emphatically
.
"
well
,
"
said
he
,
"
now
the
storm
of
eloquence
has
lulled
for
a
little
,
suppose
you
answer
my
question
?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
is
,
if
you
like
,
you
know
,
"
quoth
he
,
with
a
sudden
access
of
courtesy
.
"
what
question
?
"
said
i
.
for
i
must
confess
that
ellen
'
s
strange
and
almost
wild
beauty
had
put
it
out
of
my
head
.
said
he
:
"
first
of
all
(
excuse
my
catechising
)
,
is
there
competition
in
life
,
after
the
old
kind
,
in
the
country
whence
you
come
?
"
"
yes
,
"
said
i
,
"
it
is
the
rule
there
.
"
and
i
wondered
as
i
spoke
what
fresh
complications
i
should
get
into
as
a
result
of
this
answer
.
"
question
two
,
"
said
the
carle
:
"
are
you
not
on
the
whole
much
freer
,
more
energetic
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
a
word
,
healthier
and
happier
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
it
?
"
i
smiled
.
"
you
would
not
talk
so
if
you
had
any
idea
of
our
life
.
to
me
you
seem
here
as
if
you
were
living
in
heaven
compared
with
us
of
the
country
from
which
i
came
.
"
"
heaven
?
"
said
he
:
"
you
like
heaven
,
do
you
?
"
"
yes
,
"
said
i
.
.
.
.
.
.
snappishly
,
i
am
afraid
;
for
i
was
beginning
rather
to
resent
his
formula
.
"
well
,
i
am
far
from
sure
that
i
do
,
"
quoth
he
.
"
i
think
one
may
do
more
with
one
'
s
life
than
sitting
on
a
damp
cloud
and
singing
hymns
.
"
i
was
rather
nettled
by
this
inconsequence
,
and
said
:
"
well
,
neighbour
,
to
be
short
,
and
without
using
metaphors
,
in
the
land
whence
i
come
,
where
the
competition
which
produced
those
literary
works
which
you
admire
so
much
is
still
the
rule
,
most
people
are
thoroughly
unhappy
;
here
,
to
me
at
least
most
people
seem
thoroughly
happy
.
"
"
no
offence
,
guest
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
no
offence
,
"
said
he
;
"
but
let
me
ask
you
;
you
like
that
,
do
you
?
"
his
formula
,
put
with
such
obstinate
persistence
,
made
us
all
laugh
heartily
;
and
even
the
old
man
joined
in
the
laughter
on
the
sly
.
however
,
he
was
by
no
means
beaten
,
and
said
presently
:
"
from
all
i
can
hear
,
i
should
judge
that
a
young
woman
so
beautiful
as
my
dear
ellen
yonder
would
have
been
a
lady
,
as
they
called
it
in
the
old
time
,
and
would
not
have
had
to
wear
a
few
rags
of
silk
as
she
does
now
,
or
to
have
browned
herself
in
the
sun
as
she
has
to
do
now
.
what
do
you
say
to
that
,
eh
?
"
here
clara
,
who
had
been
pretty
much
silent
hitherto
,
struck
in
,
and
said
:
"
well
,
really
,
i
do
not
think
that
you
would
have
mended
matters
,
or
that
they
want
mending
.
do
not
you
see
that
she
is
dressed
deliciously
for
this
beautiful
weather
?
and
as
for
the
sun
-
burning
of
your
hay
-
fields
,
why
,
i
hope
to
pick
up
some
of
that
for
myself
when
we
get
a
little
higher
up
the
river
.
look
if
i
do
not
need
a
little
sun
on
my
pasty
white
skin
!
"
and
she
stripped
up
the
sleeve
from
her
arm
and
laid
it
beside
ellen
'
s
who
was
now
sitting
next
her
.
to
say
the
truth
,
it
was
rather
amusing
to
me
to
see
clara
putting
herself
forward
as
a
town
-
bred
fine
lady
,
for
she
was
as
well
-
knit
and
clean
-
skinned
a
girl
as
might
be
met
with
anywhere
at
the
best
.
dick
stroked
the
beautiful
arm
rather
shyly
,
and
pulled
down
the
sleeve
again
,
while
she
blushed
at
his
touch
;
and
the
old
man
said
laughingly
:
"
well
,
i
suppose
you
do
like
that
;
do
not
you
?
"
ellen
kissed
her
new
friend
,
and
we
all
sat
silent
for
a
little
,
till
she
broke
out
into
a
sweet
shrill
song
,
and
held
us
all
entranced
with
the
wonder
of
her
clear
voice
;
and
the
old
grumbler
sat
looking
at
her
lovingly
.
the
other
young
people
sang
also
in
due
time
;
and
then
ellen
showed
us
to
our
beds
in
small
cottage
chambers
,
fragrant
and
clean
as
the
ideal
of
the
old
pastoral
poets
;
and
the
pleasure
of
the
evening
quite
extinguished
my
fear
of
the
last
night
,
that
i
should
wake
up
in
the
old
miserable
world
of
worn
-
out
pleasures
,
and
hopes
that
were
half
fears
.
though
there
were
no
rough
noises
to
wake
me
,
i
could
not
lie
long
abed
the
next
morning
,
where
the
world
seemed
so
well
awake
,
and
,
despite
the
old
grumbler
,
so
happy
;
so
i
got
up
,
and
found
that
,
early
as
it
was
,
someone
had
been
stirring
,
since
all
was
trim
and
in
its
place
in
the
little
parlour
,
and
the
table
laid
for
the
morning
meal
.
nobody
was
afoot
in
the
house
as
then
,
however
,
so
i
went
out
a
-
doors
,
and
after
a
turn
or
two
round
the
superabundant
garden
,
i
wandered
down
over
the
meadow
to
the
river
-
side
,
where
lay
our
boat
,
looking
quite
familiar
and
friendly
to
me
.
i
walked
up
stream
a
little
,
watching
the
light
mist
curling
up
from
the
river
till
the
sun
gained
power
to
draw
it
all
away
;
saw
the
bleak
speckling
the
water
under
the
willow
boughs
,
whence
the
tiny
flies
they
fed
on
were
falling
in
myriads
;
heard
the
great
chub
splashing
here
and
there
at
some
belated
moth
or
other
,
and
felt
almost
back
again
in
my
boyhood
.
then
i
went
back
again
to
the
boat
,
and
loitered
there
a
minute
or
two
,
and
then
walked
slowly
up
the
meadow
towards
the
little
house
.
i
noted
now
that
there
were
four
more
houses
of
about
the
same
size
on
the
slope
away
from
the
river
.
the
meadow
in
which
i
was
going
was
not
up
for
hay
;
but
a
row
of
flake
-
hurdles
ran
up
the
slope
not
far
from
me
on
each
side
,
and
in
the
field
so
parted
off
from
ours
on
the
left
they
were
making
hay
busily
by
now
,
in
the
simple
fashion
of
the
days
when
i
was
a
boy
.
my
feet
turned
that
way
instinctively
,
as
i
wanted
to
see
how
haymakers
looked
in
these
new
and
better
times
,
and
also
i
rather
expected
to
see
ellen
there
.
i
came
to
the
hurdles
and
stood
looking
over
into
the
hay
-
field
,
and
was
close
to
the
end
of
the
long
line
of
haymakers
who
were
spreading
the
low
ridges
to
dry
off
the
night
dew
.
the
majority
of
these
were
young
women
clad
much
like
ellen
last
night
,
though
not
mostly
in
silk
,
but
in
light
woollen
mostly
gaily
embroidered
;
the
men
being
all
clad
in
white
flannel
embroidered
in
bright
colours
.
the
meadow
looked
like
a
gigantic
tulip
-
bed
because
of
them
.
all
hands
were
working
deliberately
but
well
and
steadily
,
though
they
were
as
noisy
with
merry
talk
as
a
grove
of
autumn
starlings
.
half
a
dozen
of
them
,
men
and
women
,
came
up
to
me
and
shook
hands
,
gave
me
the
sele
of
the
morning
,
and
asked
a
few
questions
as
to
whence
and
whither
,
and
wishing
me
good
luck
,
went
back
to
their
work
.
ellen
,
to
my
disappointment
,
was
not
amongst
them
,
but
presently
i
saw
a
light
figure
come
out
of
the
hay
-
field
higher
up
the
slope
,
and
make
for
our
house
;
and
that
was
ellen
,
holding
a
basket
in
her
hand
.
but
before
she
had
come
to
the
garden
gate
,
out
came
dick
and
clara
,
who
,
after
a
minute
'
s
pause
,
came
down
to
meet
me
,
leaving
ellen
in
the
garden
;
then
we
three
went
down
to
the
boat
,
talking
mere
morning
prattle
.
we
stayed
there
a
little
,
dick
arranging
some
of
the
matters
in
her
,
for
we
had
only
taken
up
to
the
house
such
things
as
we
thought
the
dew
might
damage
;
and
then
we
went
toward
the
house
again
;
but
when
we
came
near
the
garden
,
dick
stopped
us
by
laying
a
hand
on
my
arm
and
said
,
-
"
just
look
a
moment
.
"
i
looked
,
and
over
the
low
hedge
saw
ellen
,
shading
her
eyes
against
the
sun
as
she
looked
toward
the
hay
-
field
,
a
light
wind
stirring
in
her
tawny
hair
,
her
eyes
like
light
jewels
amidst
her
sunburnt
face
,
which
looked
as
if
the
warmth
of
the
sun
were
yet
in
it
.
"
look
,
guest
,
"
said
dick
;
"
does
not
it
all
look
like
one
of
those
very
stories
out
of
grimm
that
we
were
talking
about
up
in
bloomsbury
?
here
are
we
two
lovers
wandering
about
the
world
,
and
we
have
come
to
a
fairy
garden
,
and
there
is
the
very
fairy
herself
amidst
of
it
:
i
wonder
what
she
will
do
for
us
.
"
said
clara
demurely
,
but
not
stiffly
:
"
is
she
a
good
fairy
,
dick
?
"
"
o
,
yes
,
"
said
he
;
"
and
according
to
the
card
,
she
would
do
better
,
if
it
were
not
for
the
gnome
or
wood
-
spirit
,
our
grumbling
friend
of
last
night
.
"
we
laughed
at
this
;
and
i
said
,
"
i
hope
you
see
that
you
have
left
me
out
of
the
tale
.
"
"
well
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
'
s
true
.
you
had
better
consider
that
you
have
got
the
cap
of
darkness
,
and
are
seeing
everything
,
yourself
invisible
.
"
that
touched
me
on
my
weak
side
of
not
feeling
sure
of
my
position
in
this
beautiful
new
country
;
so
in
order
not
to
make
matters
worse
,
i
held
my
tongue
,
and
we
all
went
into
the
garden
and
up
to
the
house
together
.
i
noticed
by
the
way
that
clara
must
really
rather
have
felt
the
contrast
between
herself
as
a
town
madam
and
this
piece
of
the
summer
country
that
we
all
admired
so
,
for
she
had
rather
dressed
after
ellen
that
morning
as
to
thinness
and
scantiness
,
and
went
barefoot
also
,
except
for
light
sandals
.
the
old
man
greeted
us
kindly
in
the
parlour
,
and
said
:
"
well
,
guests
,
so
you
have
been
looking
about
to
search
into
the
nakedness
of
the
land
:
i
suppose
your
illusions
of
last
night
have
given
way
a
bit
before
the
morning
light
?
do
you
still
like
,
it
,
eh
?
"
"
very
much
,
"
said
i
,
doggedly
;
"
it
is
one
of
the
prettiest
places
on
the
lower
thames
.
"
"
oho
!
"
said
he
;
"
so
you
know
the
thames
,
do
you
?
"
i
reddened
,
for
i
saw
dick
and
clara
looking
at
me
,
and
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
.
however
,
since
i
had
said
in
our
early
intercourse
with
my
hammersmith
friends
that
i
had
known
epping
forest
,
i
thought
a
hasty
generalisation
might
be
better
in
avoiding
complications
than
a
downright
lie
;
so
i
said
-
"
i
have
been
in
this
country
before
;
and
i
have
been
on
the
thames
in
those
days
.
"
"
o
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
eagerly
,
"
so
you
have
been
in
this
country
before
.
now
really
,
do
not
you
find
it
(
apart
from
all
theory
,
you
know
)
much
changed
for
the
worse
?
"
"
no
,
not
at
all
,
"
said
i
;
"
i
find
it
much
changed
for
the
better
.
"
"
ah
,
"
quoth
he
,
"
i
fear
that
you
have
been
prejudiced
by
some
theory
or
another
.
however
,
of
course
the
time
when
you
were
here
before
must
have
been
so
near
our
own
days
that
the
deterioration
might
not
be
very
great
:
as
then
we
were
,
of
course
,
still
living
under
the
same
customs
as
we
are
now
.
i
was
thinking
of
earlier
days
than
that
.
"
"
in
short
,
"
said
clara
,
"
you
have
theories
about
the
change
which
has
taken
place
.
"
"
i
have
facts
as
well
,
"
said
he
.
"
look
here
!
from
this
hill
you
can
see
just
four
little
houses
,
including
this
one
.
well
,
i
know
for
certain
that
in
old
times
,
even
in
the
summer
,
when
the
leaves
were
thickest
,
you
could
see
from
the
same
place
six
quite
big
and
fine
houses
;
and
higher
up
the
water
,
garden
joined
garden
right
up
to
windsor
;
and
there
were
big
houses
in
all
the
gardens
.
ah
!
england
was
an
important
place
in
those
days
.
"
i
was
getting
nettled
,
and
said
:
"
what
you
mean
is
that
you
de
-
cockneyised
the
place
,
and
sent
the
damned
flunkies
packing
,
and
that
everybody
can
live
comfortably
and
happily
,
and
not
a
few
damned
thieves
only
,
who
were
centres
of
vulgarity
and
corruption
wherever
they
were
,
and
who
,
as
to
this
lovely
river
,
destroyed
its
beauty
morally
,
and
had
almost
destroyed
it
physically
,
when
they
were
thrown
out
of
it
.
"
there
was
silence
after
this
outburst
,
which
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
help
,
remembering
how
i
had
suffered
from
cockneyism
and
its
cause
on
those
same
waters
of
old
time
.
but
at
last
the
old
man
said
,
quite
coolly
:
"
my
dear
guest
,
i
really
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
either
cockneys
,
or
flunkies
,
or
thieves
,
or
damned
;
or
how
only
a
few
people
could
live
happily
and
comfortably
in
a
wealthy
country
.
all
i
can
see
is
that
you
are
angry
,
and
i
fear
with
me
:
so
if
you
like
we
will
change
the
subject
.
"
i
thought
this
kind
and
hospitable
in
him
,
considering
his
obstinacy
about
his
theory
;
and
hastened
to
say
that
i
did
not
mean
to
be
angry
,
only
emphatic
.
he
bowed
gravely
,
and
i
thought
the
storm
was
over
,
when
suddenly
ellen
broke
in
:
"
grandfather
,
our
guest
is
reticent
from
courtesy
;
but
really
what
he
has
in
his
mind
to
say
to
you
ought
to
be
said
;
so
as
i
know
pretty
well
what
it
is
,
i
will
say
it
for
him
:
for
as
you
know
,
i
have
been
taught
these
things
by
people
who
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
yes
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
by
the
sage
of
bloomsbury
,
and
others
.
"
"
o
,
"
said
dick
,
"
so
you
know
my
old
kinsman
hammond
?
"
"
yes
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
other
people
too
,
as
my
grandfather
says
,
and
they
have
taught
me
things
:
and
this
is
the
upshot
of
it
.
we
live
in
a
little
house
now
,
not
because
we
have
nothing
grander
to
do
than
working
in
the
fields
,
but
because
we
please
;
for
if
we
liked
,
we
could
go
and
live
in
a
big
house
amongst
pleasant
companions
.
"
grumbled
the
old
man
:
"
just
so
!
as
if
i
would
live
amongst
those
conceited
fellows
;
all
of
them
looking
down
upon
me
!
"
she
smiled
on
him
kindly
,
but
went
on
as
if
he
had
not
spoken
.
"
in
the
past
times
,
when
those
big
houses
of
which
grandfather
speaks
were
so
plenty
,
we
must
have
lived
in
a
cottage
whether
we
had
liked
it
or
not
;
and
the
said
cottage
,
instead
of
having
in
it
everything
we
want
,
would
have
been
bare
and
empty
.
we
should
not
have
got
enough
to
eat
;
our
clothes
would
have
been
ugly
to
look
at
,
dirty
and
frowsy
.
you
,
grandfather
,
have
done
no
hard
work
for
years
now
,
but
wander
about
and
read
your
books
and
have
nothing
to
worry
you
;
and
as
for
me
,
i
work
hard
when
i
like
it
,
because
i
like
it
,
and
think
it
does
me
good
,
and
knits
up
my
muscles
,
and
makes
me
prettier
to
look
at
,
and
healthier
and
happier
.
but
in
those
past
days
you
,
grandfather
,
would
have
had
to
work
hard
after
you
were
old
;
and
would
have
been
always
afraid
of
having
to
be
shut
up
in
a
kind
of
prison
along
with
other
old
men
,
half
-
starved
and
without
amusement
.
and
as
for
me
,
i
am
twenty
years
old
.
in
those
days
my
middle
age
would
be
beginning
now
,
and
in
a
few
years
i
should
be
pinched
,
thin
,
and
haggard
,
beset
with
troubles
and
miseries
,
so
that
no
one
could
have
guessed
that
i
was
once
a
beautiful
girl
.
"
is
this
what
you
have
had
in
your
mind
,
guest
?
"
said
she
,
the
tears
in
her
eyes
at
thought
of
the
past
miseries
of
people
like
herself
.
"
yes
,
"
said
i
,
much
moved
;
"
that
and
more
.
often
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
my
country
i
have
seen
that
wretched
change
you
have
spoken
of
,
from
the
fresh
handsome
country
lass
to
the
poor
draggle
-
tailed
country
woman
.
"
the
old
man
sat
silent
for
a
little
,
but
presently
recovered
himself
and
took
comfort
in
his
old
phrase
of
"
well
,
you
like
it
so
,
do
you
?
"
"
yes
,
"
said
ellen
,
"
i
love
life
better
than
death
.
"
"
o
,
you
do
,
do
you
?
"
said
he
.
"
well
,
for
my
part
i
like
reading
a
good
old
book
with
plenty
of
fun
in
it
,
like
thackeray
'
s
'
vanity
fair
.
'
why
do
not
you
write
books
like
that
now
?
ask
that
question
of
your
bloomsbury
sage
.
"
seeing
dick
'
s
cheeks
reddening
a
little
at
this
sally
,
and
noting
that
silence
followed
,
i
thought
i
had
better
do
something
.
so
i
said
:
"
i
am
only
the
guest
,
friends
;
but
i
know
you
want
to
show
me
your
river
at
its
best
,
so
do
not
you
think
we
had
better
be
moving
presently
,
as
it
is
certainly
going
to
be
a
hot
day
?
"
they
were
not
slow
to
take
my
hint
;
and
indeed
,
as
to
the
mere
time
of
day
,
it
was
best
for
us
to
be
off
,
as
it
was
past
seven
o
'
clock
,
and
the
day
promised
to
be
very
hot
.
so
we
got
up
and
went
down
to
our
boat
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
ellen
thoughtful
and
abstracted
;
the
old
man
very
kind
and
courteous
,
as
if
to
make
up
for
his
crabbedness
of
opinion
.
clara
was
cheerful
and
natural
,
but
a
little
subdued
,
i
thought
;
and
she
at
least
was
not
sorry
to
be
gone
,
and
often
looked
shyly
and
timidly
at
ellen
and
her
strange
wild
beauty
.
so
we
got
into
the
boat
,
dick
saying
as
he
took
his
place
,
"
well
,
it
is
a
fine
day
!
"
and
the
old
man
answering
"
what
!
you
like
that
,
do
you
?
"
once
more
;
and
presently
dick
was
sending
the
bows
swiftly
through
the
slow
weed
-
checked
stream
.
i
turned
round
as
we
got
into
mid
-
stream
,
and
waving
my
hand
to
our
hosts
,
saw
ellen
leaning
on
the
old
man
'
s
shoulder
,
and
caressing
his
healthy
apple
-
red
cheek
,
and
quite
a
keen
pang
smote
me
as
i
thought
how
i
should
never
see
the
beautiful
girl
again
.
presently
i
insisted
on
taking
the
sculls
,
and
i
rowed
a
good
deal
that
day
;
which
no
doubt
accounts
for
the
fact
that
we
got
very
late
to
the
place
which
dick
had
aimed
at
.
clara
was
particularly
affectionate
to
dick
,
as
i
noticed
from
the
rowing
thwart
;
but
as
for
him
,
he
was
as
frankly
kind
and
merry
as
ever
;
and
i
was
glad
to
see
it
,
as
a
man
of
his
temperament
could
not
have
taken
her
caresses
cheerfully
and
without
embarrassment
if
he
had
been
at
all
entangled
by
the
fairy
of
our
last
night
'
s
abode
.
i
need
say
little
about
the
lovely
reaches
of
the
river
here
.
i
duly
noted
that
absence
of
cockney
villas
which
the
old
man
had
lamented
;
and
i
saw
with
pleasure
that
my
old
enemies
the
"
gothic
"
cast
-
iron
bridges
had
been
replaced
by
handsome
oak
and
stone
ones
.
also
the
banks
of
the
forest
that
we
passed
through
had
lost
their
courtly
game
-
keeperish
trimness
,
and
were
as
wild
and
beautiful
as
need
he
,
though
the
trees
were
clearly
well
seen
to
.
i
thought
it
best
,
in
order
to
get
the
most
direct
information
,
to
play
the
innocent
about
eton
and
windsor
;
but
dick
volunteered
his
knowledge
to
me
as
we
lay
in
datchet
lock
about
the
first
.
quoth
he
:
"
up
yonder
are
some
beautiful
old
buildings
,
which
were
built
for
a
great
college
or
teaching
-
place
by
one
of
the
mediaeval
kings
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
edward
the
sixth
,
i
think
"
(
i
smiled
to
myself
at
his
rather
natural
blunder
)
.
"
he
meant
poor
people
'
s
sons
to
be
taught
there
what
knowledge
was
going
in
his
days
;
but
it
was
a
matter
of
course
that
in
the
times
of
which
you
seem
to
know
so
much
they
spoilt
whatever
good
there
was
in
the
founder
'
s
intentions
.
my
old
kinsman
says
that
they
treated
them
in
a
very
simple
way
,
and
instead
of
teaching
poor
men
'
s
sons
to
know
something
,
they
taught
rich
men
'
s
sons
to
know
nothing
.
it
seems
from
what
he
says
that
it
was
a
place
for
the
'
aristocracy
'
(
if
you
know
what
that
word
means
;
i
have
been
told
its
meaning
)
to
get
rid
of
the
company
of
their
male
children
for
a
great
part
of
the
year
.
i
daresay
old
hammond
would
give
you
plenty
of
information
in
detail
about
it
.
"
"
what
is
it
used
for
now
?
"
said
i
.
"
well
,
"
said
he
,
"
the
buildings
were
a
good
deal
spoilt
by
the
last
few
generations
of
aristocrats
,
who
seem
to
have
had
a
great
hatred
against
beautiful
old
buildings
,
and
indeed
all
records
of
past
history
;
but
it
is
still
a
delightful
place
.
of
course
,
we
cannot
use
it
quite
as
the
founder
intended
,
since
our
ideas
about
teaching
young
people
are
so
changed
from
the
ideas
of
his
time
;
so
it
is
used
now
as
a
dwelling
for
people
engaged
in
learning
;
and
folk
from
round
about
come
and
get
taught
things
that
they
want
to
learn
;
and
there
is
a
great
library
there
of
the
best
books
.
so
that
i
do
not
think
that
the
old
dead
king
would
be
much
hurt
if
he
were
to
come
to
life
and
see
what
we
are
doing
there
.
"
"
well
,
"
said
clara
,
laughing
,
"
i
think
he
would
miss
the
boys
.
"
"
not
always
,
my
dear
,
"
said
dick
,
"
for
there
are
often
plenty
of
boys
there
,
who
come
to
get
taught
;
and
also
,
"
said
he
,
smiling
,
"
to
learn
boating
and
swimming
.
i
wish
we
could
stop
there
:
but
perhaps
we
had
better
do
that
coming
down
the
water
.
"
the
lock
-
gates
opened
as
he
spoke
,
and
out
we
went
,
and
on
.
and
as
for
windsor
,
he
said
nothing
till
i
lay
on
my
oars
(
for
i
was
sculling
then
)
in
clewer
reach
,
and
looking
up
,
said
,
"
what
is
all
that
building
up
there
?
"
said
he
:
"
there
,
i
thought
i
would
wait
till
you
asked
,
yourself
.
that
is
windsor
castle
:
that
also
i
thought
i
would
keep
for
you
till
we
come
down
the
water
.
it
looks
fine
from
here
,
does
not
it
?
but
a
great
deal
of
it
has
been
built
or
skinned
in
the
time
of
the
degradation
,
and
we
would
not
pull
the
buildings
down
,
since
they
were
there
;
just
as
with
the
buildings
of
the
dung
-
market
.
you
know
,
of
course
,
that
it
was
the
palace
of
our
old
mediaeval
kings
,
and
was
used
later
on
for
the
same
purpose
by
the
parliamentary
commercial
sham
-
kings
,
as
my
old
kinsman
calls
them
.
'
'
"
yes
,
"
said
i
,
"
i
know
all
that
.
what
is
it
used
