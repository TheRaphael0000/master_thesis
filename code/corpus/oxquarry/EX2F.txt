it
was
an
eighty
-
cow
dairy
and
the
troop
of
milkers
regular
and
supernumerary
were
all
at
work
for
though
the
time
of
year
was
as
yet
but
early
april
the
feed
lay
entirely
in
water
-
meadows
and
the
cows
were
in
full
pail
the
hour
was
about
six
in
the
evening
and
three
-
fourths
of
the
large
red
rectangular
animals
having
been
finished
off
there
was
opportunity
for
a
little
conversation
'
he
do
bring
home
his
bride
to
-
morrow
i
hear
they
'
ve
come
as
far
as
anglebury
to
-
day
the
voice
seemed
to
proceed
from
the
belly
of
the
cow
called
cherry
but
the
speaker
was
a
milking
-
woman
whose
face
was
buried
in
the
flank
of
that
motionless
beast
'
hav
'
anybody
seen
her
said
another
there
was
a
negative
response
from
the
first
though
they
say
she
is
a
rosy
-
cheeked
tisty
-
tosty
little
body
enough
she
added
and
as
the
milkmaid
spoke
she
turned
her
face
so
that
she
could
glance
past
her
cow
'
s
tail
to
the
other
side
of
the
barton
where
a
thin
fading
woman
of
thirty
milked
somewhat
apart
from
the
rest
'
years
younger
than
he
they
say
continued
the
second
with
also
a
glance
of
reflectiveness
in
the
same
direction
'
how
old
do
you
call
him
then
'
thirty
or
so
'
more
like
forty
broke
in
an
old
milkman
near
in
a
long
white
pinafore
or
wropper
and
with
the
brim
of
his
hat
tied
down
so
that
he
looked
like
a
woman
'
a
was
born
before
our
great
weir
was
builded
and
i
had
not
man
'
s
wages
when
i
laved
water
there
the
discussion
waxed
so
warm
that
the
purr
of
the
milk
-
streams
became
jerky
till
a
voice
from
another
cow
'
s
belly
cried
with
authority
now
then
what
the
turk

it
matter
to
us
about

with

have

the
evening
is
pinking
in
a
'
ready
this
speaker
was
the
dairyman
himself
by
whom
the
milkmaids
and
men
were
employed
nothing
more
was
said
publicly
about
farmer
lodge
'
s
wedding
but
the
first
woman
murmured
under
her
cow
to
her
next
neighbour
'
tis
hard
for
she
signifying
the
thin
worn
milkmaid
aforesaid
'
o
no
said
the
second
he
ha
'
n
'
t
spoke
to
rhoda
brook
for
years
when
the
milking
was
done
they
washed
their
pails
and
hung
them
on
a
many
-
forked
stand
made
of
the
peeled
limb
of
an
oak
-
tree
set
upright
in
the
earth
and
resembling
a
colossal
antlered
horn
the
majority
then
dispersed
in
various
directions
homeward
the
thin
woman
who
had
not
spoken
was
joined
by
a
boy
of
twelve
or
thereabout
and
the
twain
went
away
up
the
field
also
their
course
lay
apart
from
that
of
the
others
to
a
lonely
spot
high
above
the
water
-
meads
and
not
far
from
the
border
of
egdon
heath
whose
dark
countenance
was
visible
in
the
distance
as
they
drew
nigh
to
their
home
'
they
'
ve
just
been
saying
down
in
barton
that
your
father
brings
his
young
wife
home
from
anglebury
to
-
morrow
the
woman
observed
i
shall
want
to
send
you
for
a
few
things
to
market
and
you
will
be
pretty
sure
to
meet
em
'
yes
mother
said
the
boy
is
father
married
then
'
yes
you
can
give
her
a
look
and
tell
me
what
'
s
she
is
like
if
you
do
see
her
'
yes
mother
'
if
she
is
dark
or
fair
and
if
she
is
tall
as
tall
as
i
and
if
she
seems
like
a
woman
who
has
ever
worked
for
a
living
or
one
that
has
been
always
well
off
and
has
never
done
anything
and
shows
marks
of
the
lady
on
her
as
i
expect
she
do
'
yes
they
crept
up
the
hill
in
the
twilight
and
entered
the
cottage
it
was
built
of
mud
-
walls
the
surface
of
which
had
been
washed
by
many
rains
into
channels
and
depressions
that
left
none
of
the
original
flat
face
visible
while
here
and
there
in
the
thatch
above
a
rafter
showed
like
a
bone
protruding
through
the
skin
she
was
kneeling
down
in
the
chimney
-
corner
before
two
pieces
of
turf
laid
together
with
the
heather
inwards
blowing
at
the
red
-
hot
ashes
with
her
breath
till
the
turves
flamed
the
radiance
lit
her
pale
cheek
and
made
her
dark
eyes
that
had
once
been
handsome
seem
handsome
anew
yes
she
resumed
see
if
she
is
dark
or
fair
and
if
you
can
notice
if
her
hands
be
white
if
not
see
if
they
look
as
though
she
had
ever
done
housework
or
are
milker

s
hands
like
mine
the
boy
again
promised
inattentively
this
time
his
mother
not
observing
that
he
was
cutting
a
notch
with
his
pocket
-
knife
in
the
beech
-
backed
chair
the
road
from
anglebury
to
holmstoke
is
in
general
level
but
there
is
one
place
where
a
sharp
ascent
breaks
its
monotony
farmers
homeward
-
bound
from
the
former
market
-
town
who
trot
all
the
rest
of
the
way
walk
their
horses
up
this
short
incline
the
next
evening
while
the
sun
was
yet
bright
a
handsome
new
gig
with
a
lemon
-
coloured
body
and
red
wheels
was
spinning
westward
along
the
level
highway
at
the
heels
of
a
powerful
mare
the
driver
was
a
yeoman
in
the
prime
of
life
cleanly
shaven
like
an
actor
his
face
being
toned
to
that
bluish
-
vermilion
hue
which
so
often
graces
a
thriving
farmer
'
s
features
when
returning
home
after
successful
dealings
in
the
town
beside
him
sat
a
woman
many
years
his
junior
almost
indeed
a
girl
her
face
too
was
fresh
in
colour
but
it
was
of
a
totally
different
quality
soft
and
evanescent
like
the
light
under
a
heap
of
rose
-
petals
few
people
travelled
this
way
for
it
was
not
a
main
road
and
the
long
white
riband
of
gravel
that
stretched
before
them
was
empty
save
of
one
small
scarce
-
moving
speck
which
presently
resolved
itself
into
the
figure
of
boy
who
was
creeping
on
at
a
snail
'
s
pace
and
continually
looking
behind
him
the
heavy
bundle
he
carried
being
some
excuse
for
if
not
the
reason
of
his
dilatoriness
when
the
bouncing
gig
-
party
slowed
at
the
bottom
of
the
incline
above
mentioned
the
pedestrian
was
only
a
few
yards
in
front
supporting
the
large
bundle
by
putting
one
hand
on
his
hip
he
turned
and
looked
straight
at
the
farmer
'
s
wife
as
though
he
would
read
her
through
and
through
pacing
along
abreast
of
the
horse
the
low
sun
was
full
in
her
face
rendering
every
feature
shade
and
contour
distinct
from
the
curve
of
her
little
nostril
to
the
colour
of
her
eyes
the
farmer
though
he
seemed
annoyed
at
the
boy
'
s
persistent
presence
did
not
order
him
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
thus
the
lad
preceded
them
his
hard
gaze
never
leaving
her
till
they
reached
the
top
of
the
ascent
when
the
farmer
trotted
on
with
relief
in
his
lineaments
having
taken
no
outward
notice
of
the
boy
whatever
'
how
that
poor
lad
stared
at
me
said
the
young
wife
'
yes
dear
i
saw
that
he
did
'
he
is
one
of
the
village
i
suppose
'
one
of
the
neighbourhood
i
think
he
lives
with
his
mother
a
mile
or
two
off
'
he
knows
who
we
are
no
doubt
'
o
yes
you
must
expect
to
be
stared
at
just
at
first
my
pretty
gertrude
'
i
do
though
i
think
the
poor
boy
may
have
looked
at
us
in
the
hope
we
might
relieve
him
of
his
heavy
load
rather
than
from
curiosity
'
o
no
said
her
husband
off
-
handedly
these
country
lads
will
carry
a
hundredweight
once
they
get
it
on
their
backs
besides
his
pack
had
more
size
than
weight
in
it
now
then
another
mile
and
i
shall
be
able
to
show
you
our
house
in
the
distance
if
it
is
not
too
dark
before
we
get
there
the
wheels
spun
round
and
particles
flew
from
their
periphery
as
before
till
a
white
house
of
ample
dimensions
revealed
itself
with
farm
-
buildings
and
ricks
at
the
back
meanwhile
the
boy
had
quickened
his
pace
and
turning
up
a
by
-
lane
some
mile
and
half
short
of
the
white
farmstead
ascended
towards
the
leaner
pastures
and
so
on
to
the
cottage
of
his
mother
she
had
reached
home
after
her
day
'
s
milking
at
the
outlying
dairy
and
was
washing
cabbage
at
the
doorway
in
the
declining
light
hold
up
the
net
a
moment
she
said
without
preface
as
the
boy
came
up
he
flung
down
his
bundle
held
the
edge
of
the
cabbage
-
net
and
as
she
filled
its
meshes
with
the
dripping
leaves
she
went
on
well
did
you
see
her
'
yes
quite
plain
'
is
she
ladylike
'
yes
and
more
a
lady
complete
'
is
she
young
'
well
she
is
growed
up
and
her
ways
be
quite
a
woman
'
s
'
of
course
what
colour
is
her
hair
and
face
'
her
hair
is
lightish
and
her
face
as
comely
as
a
live
doll
'
s
'
her
eyes
then
are
not
dark
like
mine
'
no
of
a
bluish
turn
and
her
mouth
is
very
nice
and
red
and
when
she
smiles
her
teeth
show
white
'
is
she
tall
said
the
woman
sharply
'
i
could
not
see
she
was
sitting
down
'
then
do
you
go
to
holmstoke
church
to
-
morrow
morning
she
is
sure
to
be
there
go
early
and
notice
her
walking
in
and
come
home
and
tell
me
if
she
is
taller
than
i
'
very
well
mother
but
why
do
not
you
go
and
see
for
yourself
i
go
to
see
her
i
would
not
look
up
at
her
if
she
were
to
pass
my
window
this
instant
she
was
with
mr
lodge
of
course
what
did
he
say
or
do
'
just
the
same
as
usual
'
took
no
notice
of
you
'
none
next
day
the
mother
put
a
clean
shirt
on
the
boy
and
started
him
off
for
holmstoke
church
he
reached
the
ancient
little
pile
when
the
door
was
just
being
opened
and
he
was
the
first
to
enter
taking
his
seat
by
the
font
he
watched
all
the
parishioners
file
in
the
well
-
to
-
do
farmer
lodge
came
nearly
last
and
his
young
wife
who
accompanied
him
walked
up
the
aisle
with
the
shyness
natural
to
a
modest
woman
who
had
appeared
thus
for
the
first
time
as
all
other
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
the
youth
'
s
stare
was
not
noticed
now
when
he
reached
home
his
mother
said
well
before
he
had
entered
the
room
'
she
is
not
tall
she
is
rather
short
he
replied
'
ah
said
his
mother
with
satisfaction
'
but
she
is
very
pretty
very
in
fact
she
is
lovely
the
youthful
freshness
of
the
yeoman
'
s
wife
had
evidently
made
an
impression
even
on
the
somewhat
hard
nature
of
the
boy
'
that
'
s
all
i
want
to
hear
said
his
mother
quickly
now
spread
the
table
-
cloth
the
hare
you
caught
is
very
tender
but
mind
that
nobody
catches
you
you
'
ve
never
told
me
what
sort
of
hands
she
had
'
i
have
never
seen
em
she
never
took
off
her
gloves
'
what
did
she
wear
this
morning
'
a
white
bonnet
and
a
silver
-
coloured
gownd
it
whewed
and
whistled
so
loud
when
it
rubbed
against
the
pews
that
the
lady
coloured
up
more
than
ever
for
very
shame
at
the
noise
and
pulled
it
in
to
keep
it
from
touching
but
when
she
pushed
into
her
seat
it
whewed
more
than
ever
mr
lodge
he
seemed
pleased
and
his
waistcoat
stuck
out
and
his
great
golden
seals
hung
like
a
lord
'
s
but
she
seemed
to
wish
her
noisy
gownd
anywhere
but
on
her
'
not
she
however
that
will
do
now
these
descriptions
of
the
newly
-
married
couple
were
continued
from
time
to
time
by
the
boy
at
his
mother
'
s
request
after
any
chance
encounter
he
had
had
with
them
but
rhoda
brook
though
she
might
easily
have
seen
young
mrs
lodge
for
herself
by
walking
a
couple
of
miles
would
never
attempt
an
excursion
towards
the
quarter
where
the
farmhouse
lay
neither
did
she
at
the
daily
milking
in
the
dairyman
'
s
yard
on
lodge
'
s
outlying
second
farm
ever
speak
on
the
subject
of
the
recent
marriage
the
dairyman
who
rented
the
cows
of
lodge
and
knew
perfectly
the
tall
milkmaid
'
s
history
with
manly
kindliness
always
kept
the
gossip
in
the
cow
-
barton
from
annoying
rhoda
but
the
atmosphere
thereabout
was
full
of
the
subject
during
the
first
days
of
mrs
lodge
'
s
arrival
and
from
her
boy
'
s
description
and
the
casual
words
of
the
other
milkers
rhoda
brook
could
raise
a
mental
image
of
the
unconscious
mrs
lodge
that
was
realistic
as
a
photograph
one
night
two
or
three
weeks
after
the
bridal
return
when
the
boy
was
gone
to
bed
rhoda
sat
a
long
time
over
the
turf
ashes
that
she
had
raked
out
in
front
of
her
to
extinguish
them
she
contemplated
so
intently
the
new
wife
as
presented
to
her
in
her
mind
'
s
eye
over
the
embers
that
she
forgot
the
lapse
of
time
at
last
wearied
with
her
day
'
s
work
she
too
retired
but
the
figure
which
had
occupied
her
so
much
during
this
and
the
previous
days
was
not
to
be
banished
at
night
for
the
first
time
gertrude
lodge
visited
the
supplanted
woman
in
her
dreams
rhoda
brook
dreamed
since
her
assertion
that
she
really
saw
before
falling
asleep
was
not
to
be
believed
that
the
young
wife
in
the
pale
silk
dress
and
white
bonnet
but
with
features
shockingly
distorted
and
wrinkled
as
by
age
was
sitting
upon
her
chest
as
she
lay
the
pressure
of
mrs
lodge
'
s
person
grew
heavier
the
blue
eyes
peered
cruelly
into
her
face
and
then
the
figure
thrust
forward
its
left
hand
mockingly
so
as
to
make
the
wedding
-
ring
it
wore
glitter
in
rhoda
'
s
eyes
maddened
mentally
and
nearly
suffocated
by
pressure
the
sleeper
struggled
the
incubus
still
regarding
her
withdrew
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
only
however
to
come
forward
by
degrees
resume
her
seat
and
flash
her
left
hand
as
before
gasping
for
breath
rhoda
in
a
last
desperate
effort
swung
out
her
right
hand
seized
the
confronting
spectre
by
its
obtrusive
left
arm
and
whirled
it
backward
to
the
floor
starting
up
herself
as
she
did
so
with
a
low
cry
'
o
merciful
heaven
she
cried
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
in
a
cold
sweat
that
was
not
a
dream
she
was
here
she
could
feel
her
antagonist
'
s
arm
within
her
grasp
even
now
the
very
flesh
and
bone
of
it
as
it
seemed
she
looked
on
the
floor
whither
she
had
whirled
the
spectre
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
rhoda
brook
slept
no
more
that
night
and
when
she
went
milking
at
the
next
dawn
they
noticed
how
pale
and
haggard
she
looked
the
milk
that
she
drew
quivered
into
the
pail
her
hand
had
not
calmed
even
yet
and
still
retained
the
feel
of
the
arm
she
came
home
to
breakfast
as
wearily
as
if
it
had
been
suppertime
'
what
was
that
noise
in
your
chimmer
mother
last
night
said
her
son
you
fell
off
the
bed
surely
'
did
you
hear
anything
fall
at
what
time
'
just
when
the
clock
struck
two
she
could
not
explain
and
when
the
meal
was
done
went
silently
about
her
household
work
the
boy
assisting
her
for
he
hated
going
afield
on
the
farms
and
she
indulged
his
reluctance
between
eleven
and
twelve
the
garden
-
gate
clicked
and
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
window
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
within
the
gate
stood
the
woman
of
her
vision
rhoda
seemed
transfixed
'
ah
she
said
she
would
come
exclaimed
the
boy
also
observing
her
'
said
so
when
how
does
she
know
us
'
i
have
seen
and
spoken
to
her
i
talked
to
her
yesterday
'
i
told
you
said
the
mother
flushing
indignantly
never
to
speak
to
anybody
in
that
house
or
go
near
the
place
'
i
did
not
speak
to
her
till
she
spoke
to
me
and
i
did
not
go
near
the
place
i
met
her
in
the
road
'
what
did
you
tell
her
'
nothing
she
said
are
you
the
poor
boy
who
had
to
bring
the
heavy
load
from
market
and
she
looked
at
my
boots
and
said
they
would
not
keep
my
feet
dry
if
it
came
on
wet
because
they
were
so
cracked
i
told
her
i
lived
with
my
mother
and
we
had
enough
to
do
to
keep
ourselves
and
that
'
s
how
it
was
and
she
said
then
i
will
come
and
bring
you
some
better
boots
and
see
your
mother
she
gives
away
things
to
other
folks
in
the
meads
besides
us
mrs
lodge
was
by
this
time
close
to
the
door
not
in
her
silk
as
rhoda
had
seen
her
in
the
bed
-
chamber
but
in
a
morning
hat
and
gown
of
common
light
material
which
became
her
better
than
silk
on
her
arm
she
carried
a
basket
the
impression
remaining
from
the
night
'
s
experience
was
still
strong
brook
had
almost
expected
to
see
the
wrinkles
the
scorn
and
the
cruelty
on
her
visitor
'
s
face
she
would
have
escaped
an
interview
had
escape
been
possible
there
was
however
no
backdoor
to
the
cottage
and
in
an
instant
the
boy
had
lifted
the
latch
to
mrs
lodge
'
s
gentle
knock
'
i
see
i
have
come
to
the
right
house
said
she
glancing
at
the
lad
and
smiling
but
i
was
not
sure
till
you
opened
the
door
the
figure
and
action
were
those
of
the
phantom
but
her
voice
was
so
indescribably
sweet
her
glance
so
winning
her
smile
so
tender
so
unlike
that
of
rhoda
'
s
midnight
visitant
that
the
latter
could
hardly
believe
the
evidence
of
her
senses
she
was
truly
glad
that
she
had
not
hidden
away
in
sheer
aversion
as
she
had
been
inclined
to
do
in
her
basket
mrs
lodge
brought
the
pair
of
boots
that
she
had
promised
to
the
boy
and
other
useful
articles
at
these
proofs
of
a
kindly
feeling
towards
her
and
hers
rhoda
'
s
heart
reproached
her
bitterly
this
innocent
young
thing
should
have
her
blessing
and
not
her
curse
when
she
left
them
a
light
seemed
gone
from
the
dwelling
two
days
later
she
came
again
to
know
if
the
boots
fitted
and
less
than
a
fortnight
after
that
paid
rhoda
another
call
on
this
occasion
the
boy
was
absent
'
i
walk
a
good
deal
said
mrs
lodge
and
your
house
is
the
nearest
outside
our
own
parish
i
hope
you
are
well
you
do
not
look
quite
well
rhoda
said
she
was
well
enough
and
indeed
though
the
paler
of
the
two
there
was
more
of
the
strength
that
endures
in
her
well
-
defined
features
and
large
frame
than
in
the
soft
-
cheeked
young
woman
before
her
the
conversation
became
quite
confidential
as
regarded
their
powers
and
weaknesses
and
when
mrs
lodge
was
leaving
rhoda
said
i
hope
you
will
find
this
air
agree
with
you
ma
'
am
and
not
suffer
from
the
damp
of
the
water
-
meads
the
younger
one
replied
that
there
was
not
much
doubt
of
it
her
general
health
being
usually
good
though
now
you
remind
me
she
added
i
have
one
little
ailment
which
puzzles
me
it
is
nothing
serious
but
i
cannot
make
it
out
she
uncovered
her
left
hand
and
arm
and
their
outline
confronted
rhoda
'
s
gaze
as
the
exact
original
of
the
limb
she
had
beheld
and
seized
in
her
dream
upon
the
pink
round
surface
of
the
arm
were
faint
marks
of
an
unhealthy
colour
as
if
produced
by
a
rough
grasp
rhoda
'
s
eyes
became
riveted
on
the
discolorations
she
fancied
that
she
discerned
in
them
the
shape
of
her
own
four
fingers
'
how
did
it
happen
she
said
mechanically
'
i
cannot
tell
replied
mrs
lodge
shaking
her
head
one
night
when
i
was
sound
asleep
dreaming
i
was
away
in
some
strange
place
a
pain
suddenly
shot
into
my
arm
there
and
was
so
keen
as
to
awaken
me
i
must
have
struck
it
in
the
daytime
i
suppose
though
i
do
not
remember
doing
so
she
added
laughing
i
tell
my
dear
husband
that
it
looks
just
as
if
he
had
flown
into
a
rage
and
struck
me
there
o
i
daresay
it
will
soon
disappear
'
ha
ha
yes
on
what
night
did
it
come
mrs
lodge
considered
and
said
it
would
be
a
fortnight
ago
on
the
morrow
when
i
awoke
i
could
not
remember
where
i
was
she
added
till
the
clock
striking
two
reminded
me
she
had
named
the
night
and
the
hour
of
rhoda
'
s
spectral
encounter
and
brook
felt
like
a
guilty
thing
the
artless
disclosure
startled
her
she
did
not
reason
on
the
freaks
of
coincidence
and
all
the
scenery
of
that
ghastly
night
returned
with
double
vividness
to
her
mind
'
o
can
it
be
she
said
to
herself
when
her
visitor
had
departed
that
i
exercise
a
malignant
power
over
people
against
my
own
will
she
knew
that
she
had
been
slily
called
a
witch
since
her
fall
but
never
having
understood
why
that
particular
stigma
had
been
attached
to
her
it
had
passed
disregarded
could
this
be
the
explanation
and
had
such
things
as
this
ever
happened
before
the
summer
drew
on
and
rhoda
brook
almost
dreaded
to
meet
mrs
lodge
again
notwithstanding
that
her
feeling
for
the
young
wife
amounted
well
-
nigh
to
affection
something
in
her
own
individuality
seemed
to
convict
rhoda
of
crime
yet
a
fatality
sometimes
would
direct
the
steps
of
the
latter
to
the
outskirts
of
holmstoke
whenever
she
left
her
house
for
any
other
purpose
than
her
daily
work
and
hence
it
happened
that
their
next
encounter
was
out
of
doors
rhoda
could
not
avoid
the
subject
which
had
so
mystified
her
and
after
the
first
few
words
she
stammered
i
hope
your
arm
is
well
again
ma
'
am
she
had
perceived
with
consternation
that
gertrude
lodge
carried
her
left
arm
stiffly
'
no
it
is
not
quite
well
indeed
it
is
no
better
at
all
it
is
rather
worse
it
pains
me
dreadfully
sometimes
'
perhaps
you
had
better
go
to
a
doctor
ma
'
am
she
replied
that
she
had
already
seen
a
doctor
her
husband
had
insisted
upon
her
going
to
one
but
the
surgeon
had
not
seemed
to
understand
the
afflicted
limb
at
all
he
had
told
her
to
bathe
it
in
hot
water
and
she
had
bathed
it
but
the
treatment
had
done
no
good
'
will
you
let
me
see
it
said
the
milkwoman
mrs
lodge
pushed
up
her
sleeve
and
disclosed
the
place
which
was
a
few
inches
above
the
wrist
as
soon
as
rhoda
brook
saw
it
she
could
hardly
preserve
her
composure
there
was
nothing
of
the
nature
of
a
wound
but
the
arm
at
that
point
had
a
shrivelled
look
and
the
outline
of
the
four
fingers
appeared
more
distinct
than
at
the
former
time
moreover
she
fancied
that
they
were
imprinted
in
precisely
the
relative
position
of
her
clutch
upon
the
arm
in
the
trance
the
first
finger
towards
gertrude
'
s
wrist
and
the
fourth
towards
her
elbow
what
the
impress
resembled
seemed
to
have
struck
gertrude
herself
since
their
last
meeting
it
looks
almost
like
finger
-
marks
she
said
adding
with
a
faint
laugh
my
husband
says
it
is
as
if
some
witch
or
the
devil
himself
had
taken
hold
of
me
there
and
blasted
the
flesh
rhoda
shivered
that
'
s
fancy
she
said
hurriedly
i
would
not
mind
it
if
i
were
you
'
i
should
not
so
much
mind
it
said
the
younger
with
hesitation
if
if
i
had
not
a
notion
that
it
makes
my
husband
dislike
me
no
love
me
less
men
think
so
much
of
personal
appearance
'
some
do
he
for
one
'
yes
and
he
was
very
proud
of
mine
at
first
'
keep
your
arm
covered
from
his
sight
'
ah
he
knows
the
disfigurement
is
there
she
tried
to
hide
the
tears
that
filled
her
eyes
'
well
ma
'
am
i
earnestly
hope
it
will
go
away
soon
and
so
the
milkwoman
'
s
mind
was
chained
anew
to
the
subject
by
a
horrid
sort
of
spell
as
she
returned
home
the
sense
of
having
been
guilty
of
an
act
of
malignity
increased
affect
as
she
might
to
ridicule
her
superstition
in
her
secret
heart
rhoda
did
not
altogether
object
to
a
slight
diminution
of
her
successor
'
s
beauty
by
whatever
means
it
had
come
about
but
she
did
not
wish
to
inflict
upon
her
physical
pain
for
though
this
pretty
young
woman
had
rendered
impossible
any
reparation
which
lodge
might
have
made
rhoda
for
his
past
conduct
everything
like
resentment
at
the
unconscious
usurpation
had
quite
passed
away
from
the
elder
'
s
mind
if
the
sweet
and
kindly
gertrude
lodge
only
knew
of
the
scene
in
the
bed
-
chamber
what
would
she
think
not
to
inform
her
of
it
seemed
treachery
in
the
presence
of
her
friendliness
but
tell
she
could
not
of
her
own
accord
neither
could
she
devise
a
remedy
she
mused
upon
the
matter
the
greater
part
of
the
night
and
the
next
day
after
the
morning
milking
set
out
to
obtain
another
glimpse
of
gertrude
lodge
if
she
could
being
held
to
her
by
a
gruesome
fascination
by
watching
the
house
from
a
distance
the
milkmaid
was
presently
able
to
discern
the
farmer
'
s
wife
in
a
ride
she
was
taking
alone
probably
to
join
her
husband
in
some
distant
field
mrs
lodge
perceived
her
and
cantered
in
her
direction
'
good
morning
rhoda
gertrude
said
when
she
had
come
up
i
was
going
to
call
rhoda
noticed
that
mrs
lodge
held
the
reins
with
some
difficulty
'
i
hope
the
bad
arm
said
rhoda
'
they
tell
me
there
is
possibly
one
way
by
which
i
might
be
able
to
find
out
the
cause
and
so
perhaps
the
cure
of
it
replied
the
other
anxiously
it
is
by
going
to
some
clever
man
over
in
egdon
heath
they
did
not
know
if
he
was
still
alive
and
i
cannot
remember
his
name
at
this
moment
but
they
said
that
you
knew
more
of
his
movements
than
anybody
else
hereabout
and
could
tell
me
if
he
were
still
to
be
consulted
dear
me
what
was
his
name
but
you
know
'
not
conjuror
trendle
said
her
thin
companion
turning
pale
'
trendle
yes
is
he
alive
'
i
believe
so
said
rhoda
with
reluctance
'
why
do
you
call
him
conjuror
'
well
they
say
they
used
to
say
he
was
a
he
had
powers
other
folks
have
not
'
o
how
could
my
people
be
so
superstitious
as
to
recommend
a
man
of
that
sort
i
thought
they
meant
some
medical
man
i
shall
think
no
more
of
him
rhoda
looked
relieved
and
mrs
lodge
rode
on
the
milkwoman
had
inwardly
seen
from
the
moment
she
heard
of
her
having
been
mentioned
as
a
reference
for
this
man
that
there
must
exist
a
sarcastic
feeling
among
the
work
-
folk
that
a
sorceress
would
know
the
whereabouts
of
the
exorcist
they
suspected
her
then
a
short
time
ago
this
would
have
given
no
concern
to
a
woman
of
her
common
-
sense
but
she
had
a
haunting
reason
to
be
superstitious
now
and
she
had
been
seized
with
sudden
dread
that
this
conjuror
trendle
might
name
her
as
the
malignant
influence
which
was
blasting
the
fair
person
of
gertrude
and
so
lead
her
friend
to
hate
her
for
ever
and
to
treat
her
as
some
fiend
in
human
shape
but
all
was
not
over
two
days
after
a
shadow
intruded
into
the
window
-
pattern
thrown
on
rhoda
brook
'
s
floor
by
the
afternoon
sun
the
woman
opened
the
door
at
once
almost
breathlessly
'
are
you
alone
said
gertrude
she
seemed
to
be
no
less
harassed
and
anxious
than
brook
herself
'
yes
said
rhoda
'
the
place
on
my
arm
seems
worse
and
troubles
me
the
young
farmer
'
s
wife
went
on
it
is
so
mysterious
i
do
hope
it
will
not
be
an
incurable
wound
i
have
again
been
thinking
of
what
they
said
about
conjuror
trendle
i
do
not
really
believe
in
such
men
but
i
should
not
mind
just
visiting
him
from
curiosity
though
on
no
account
must
my
husband
know
is
it
far
to
where
he
lives
'
yes
five
miles
said
rhoda
backwardly
in
the
heart
of
egdon
'
well
i
should
have
to
walk
could
not
you
go
with
me
to
show
me
the
way
say
to
-
morrow
afternoon
'
o
not
i
that
is
the
milkwoman
murmured
with
a
start
of
dismay
again
the
dread
seized
her
that
something
to
do
with
her
fierce
act
in
the
dream
might
be
revealed
and
her
character
in
the
eyes
of
the
most
useful
friend
she
had
ever
had
be
ruined
irretrievably
mrs
lodge
urged
and
rhoda
finally
assented
though
with
much
misgiving
sad
as
the
journey
would
be
to
her
she
could
not
conscientiously
stand
in
the
way
of
a
possible
remedy
for
her
patron
'
s
strange
affliction
it
was
agreed
that
to
escape
suspicion
of
their
mystic
intent
they
should
meet
at
the
edge
of
the
heath
at
the
corner
of
a
plantation
which
was
visible
from
the
spot
where
they
now
stood
by
the
next
afternoon
rhoda
would
have
done
anything
to
escape
this
inquiry
but
she
had
promised
to
go
moreover
there
was
a
horrid
fascination
at
times
in
becoming
instrumental
in
throwing
such
possible
light
on
her
own
character
as
would
reveal
her
to
be
something
greater
in
the
occult
world
than
she
had
ever
herself
suspected
she
started
just
before
the
time
of
day
mentioned
between
them
and
half
-
an
-
hour
'
s
brisk
walking
brought
her
to
the
south
-
eastern
extension
of
the
egdon
tract
of
country
where
the
fir
plantation
was
a
slight
figure
cloaked
and
veiled
was
already
there
rhoda
recognized
almost
with
a
shudder
that
mrs
lodge
bore
her
left
arm
in
a
sling
they
hardly
spoke
to
each
other
and
immediately
set
out
on
their
climb
into
the
interior
of
this
solemn
country
which
stood
high
above
the
rich
alluvial
soil
they
had
left
half
-
an
-
hour
before
it
was
a
long
walk
thick
clouds
made
the
atmosphere
dark
though
it
was
as
yet
only
early
afternoon
and
the
wind
howled
dismally
over
the
hills
of
the
heath
not
improbably
the
same
heath
which
had
witnessed
the
agony
of
the
wessex
king
ina
presented
to
after
-
ages
as
lear
gertrude
lodge
talked
most
rhoda
replying
with
monosyllabic
preoccupation
she
had
a
strange
dislike
to
walking
on
the
side
of
her
companion
where
hung
the
afflicted
arm
moving
round
to
the
other
when
inadvertently
near
it
much
heather
had
been
brushed
by
their
feet
when
they
descended
upon
a
cart
-
track
beside
which
stood
the
house
of
the
man
they
sought
he
did
not
profess
his
remedial
practices
openly
or
care
anything
about
their
continuance
his
direct
interests
being
those
of
a
dealer
in
furze
turf
sharp
sand
and
other
local
products
indeed
he
affected
not
to
believe
largely
in
his
own
powers
and
when
warts
that
had
been
shown
him
for
cure
miraculously
disappeared
which
it
must
be
owned
they
infallibly
did
he
would
say
lightly
o
i
only
drink
a
glass
of
grog
upon
em
perhaps
it
is
all
chance
and
immediately
turn
the
subject
he
was
at
home
when
they
arrived
having
in
fact
seen
them
descending
into
his
valley
he
was
a
gray
-
bearded
man
with
a
reddish
face
and
he
looked
singularly
at
rhoda
the
first
moment
he
beheld
her
mrs
lodge
told
him
her
errand
and
then
with
words
of
self
-
disparagement
he
examined
her
arm
'
medicine
ca
not
cure
it
he
said
promptly
'
tis
the
work
of
an
enemy
rhoda
shrank
into
herself
and
drew
back
an
enemy
what
enemy
asked
mrs
lodge
he
shook
his
head
that
'
s
best
known
to
yourself
he
said
if
you
like
i
can
show
the
person
to
you
though
i
shall
not
myself
know
who
it
is
i
can
do
no
more
and
do
not
wish
to
do
that
she
pressed
him
on
which
he
told
rhoda
to
wait
outside
where
she
stood
and
took
mrs
lodge
into
the
room
it
opened
immediately
from
the
door
and
as
the
latter
remained
ajar
rhoda
brook
could
see
the
proceedings
without
taking
part
in
them
he
brought
a
tumbler
from
the
dresser
nearly
filled
it
with
water
and
fetching
an
egg
prepared
it
in
some
private
way
after
which
he
broke
it
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
so
that
the
white
went
in
and
the
yolk
remained
as
it
was
getting
gloomy
he
took
the
glass
and
its
contents
to
the
window
and
told
gertrude
to
watch
them
closely
they
leant
over
the
table
together
and
the
milkwoman
could
see
the
opaline
hue
of
the
egg
-
fluid
changing
form
as
it
sank
in
the
water
but
she
was
not
near
enough
to
define
the
shape
that
it
assumed
'
do
you
catch
the
likeness
of
any
face
or
figure
as
you
look
demanded
the
conjuror
of
the
young
woman
she
murmured
a
reply
in
tones
so
low
as
to
be
inaudible
to
rhoda
and
continued
to
gaze
intently
into
the
glass
rhoda
turned
and
walked
a
few
steps
away
when
mrs
lodge
came
out
and
her
face
was
met
by
the
light
it
appeared
exceedingly
pale
as
pale
as
rhoda
'
s
against
the
sad
dun
shades
of
the
upland
'
s
garniture
trendle
shut
the
door
behind
her
and
they
at
once
started
homeward
together
but
rhoda
perceived
that
her
companion
had
quite
changed
'
did
he
charge
much
she
asked
tentatively
'
o
no
nothing
he
would
not
take
a
farthing
said
gertrude
'
and
what
did
you
see
inquired
rhoda
'
nothing
i
care
to
speak
of
the
constraint
in
her
manner
was
remarkable
her
face
was
so
rigid
as
to
wear
an
oldened
aspect
faintly
suggestive
of
the
face
in
rhoda
'
s
bed
-
chamber
'
was
it
you
who
first
proposed
coming
here
mrs
lodge
suddenly
inquired
after
a
long
pause
how
very
odd
if
you
did
'
no
but
i
am
not
sorry
we
have
come
all
things
considered
she
replied
for
the
first
time
a
sense
of
triumph
possessed
her
and
she
did
not
altogether
deplore
that
the
young
thing
at
her
side
should
learn
that
their
lives
had
been
antagonized
by
other
influences
than
their
own
the
subject
was
no
more
alluded
to
during
the
long
and
dreary
walk
home
but
in
some
way
or
other
a
story
was
whispered
about
the
many
-
dairied
lowland
that
winter
that
mrs
lodge
'
s
gradual
loss
of
the
use
of
her
left
arm
was
owing
to
her
being
overlooked
'
by
rhoda
brook
the
latter
kept
her
own
counsel
about
the
incubus
but
her
face
grew
sadder
and
thinner
and
in
the
spring
she
and
her
boy
disappeared
from
the
neighbourhood
of
holmstoke
half
-
a
-
dozen
years
passed
away
and
mr
and
mrs
lodge
'
s
married
experience
sank
into
prosiness
and
worse
the
farmer
was
usually
gloomy
and
silent
the
woman
whom
he
had
wooed
for
her
grace
and
beauty
was
contorted
and
disfigured
in
the
left
limb
moreover
she
had
brought
him
no
child
which
rendered
it
likely
that
he
would
be
the
last
of
a
family
who
had
occupied
that
valley
for
some
two
hundred
years
he
thought
of
rhoda
brook
and
her
son
and
feared
this
might
be
a
judgment
from
heaven
upon
him
the
once
blithe
-
hearted
and
enlightened
gertrude
was
changing
into
an
irritable
superstitious
woman
whose
whole
time
was
given
to
experimenting
upon
her
ailment
with
every
quack
remedy
she
came
across
she
was
honestly
attached
to
her
husband
and
was
ever
secretly
hoping
against
hope
to
win
back
his
heart
again
by
regaining
some
at
least
of
her
personal
beauty
hence
it
arose
that
her
closet
was
lined
with
bottles
packets
and
ointment
-
pots
of
every
description
nay
bunches
of
mystic
herbs
charms
and
books
of
necromancy
which
in
her
schoolgirl
time
she
would
have
ridiculed
as
folly
'
damned
if
you
wo
not
poison
yourself
with
these
apothecary
messes
and
witch
mixtures
some
time
or
other
said
her
husband
when
his
eye
chanced
to
fall
upon
the
multitudinous
array
she
did
not
reply
but
turned
her
sad
soft
glance
upon
him
in
such
heart
-
swollen
reproach
that
he
looked
sorry
for
his
words
and
added
i
only
meant
it
for
your
good
you
know
gertrude
'
i
will
clear
out
the
whole
lot
and
destroy
them
said
she
huskily
and
try
such
remedies
no
more
'
you
want
somebody
to
cheer
you
he
observed
i
once
thought
of
adopting
a
boy
but
he
is
too
old
now
and
he
is
gone
away
i
do
not
know
where
she
guessed
to
whom
he
alluded
for
rhoda
brook
'
s
story
had
in
the
course
of
years
become
known
to
her
though
not
a
word
had
ever
passed
between
her
husband
and
herself
on
the
subject
neither
had
she
ever
spoken
to
him
of
her
visit
to
conjuror
trendle
and
of
what
was
revealed
to
her
or
she
thought
was
revealed
to
her
by
that
solitary
heath
-
man
she
was
now
five
-
and
-
twenty
but
she
seemed
older
'
six
years
of
marriage
and
only
a
few
months
of
love
she
sometimes
whispered
to
herself
and
then
she
thought
of
the
apparent
cause
and
said
with
a
tragic
glance
at
her
withering
limb
if
i
could
only
again
be
as
i
was
when
he
first
saw
me
she
obediently
destroyed
her
nostrums
and
charms
but
there
remained
a
hankering
wish
to
try
something
else
some
other
sort
of
cure
altogether
she
had
never
revisited
trendle
since
she
had
been
conducted
to
the
house
of
the
solitary
by
rhoda
against
her
will
but
it
now
suddenly
occurred
to
gertrude
that
she
would
in
a
last
desperate
effort
at
deliverance
from
this
seeming
curse
again
seek
out
the
man
if
he
yet
lived
he
was
entitled
to
a
certain
credence
for
the
indistinct
form
he
had
raised
in
the
glass
had
undoubtedly
resembled
the
only
woman
in
the
world
who
as
she
now
knew
though
not
then
could
have
a
reason
for
bearing
her
ill
-
will
the
visit
should
be
paid
this
time
she
went
alone
though
she
nearly
got
lost
on
the
heath
and
roamed
a
considerable
distance
out
of
her
way
trendle
'
s
house
was
reached
at
last
however
he
was
not
indoors
and
instead
of
waiting
at
the
cottage
she
went
to
where
his
bent
figure
was
pointed
out
to
her
at
work
a
long
way
off
trendle
remembered
her
and
laying
down
the
handful
of
furze
-
roots
which
he
was
gathering
and
throwing
into
a
heap
he
offered
to
accompany
her
in
her
homeward
direction
as
the
distance
was
considerable
and
the
days
were
short
so
they
walked
together
his
head
bowed
nearly
to
the
earth
and
his
form
of
a
colour
with
it
'
you
can
send
away
warts
and
other
excrescences
i
know
she
said
why
ca
not
you
send
away
this
and
the
arm
was
uncovered
'
you
think
too
much
of
my
powers
said
trendle
and
i
am
old
and
weak
now
too
no
no
it
is
too
much
for
me
to
attempt
in
my
own
person
what
have
ye
tried
she
named
to
him
some
of
the
hundred
medicaments
and
counterspells
which
she
had
adopted
from
time
to
time
he
shook
his
head
'
some
were
good
enough
he
said
approvingly
but
not
many
of
them
for
such
as
this
this
is
of
the
nature
of
a
blight
not
of
the
nature
of
a
wound
and
if
you
ever
do
throw
it
off
it
will
be
all
at
once
'
if
i
only
could
'
there
is
only
one
chance
of
doing
it
known
to
me
it
has
never
failed
in
kindred
afflictions
that
i
can
declare
but
it
is
hard
to
carry
out
and
especially
for
a
woman
'
tell
me
said
she
'
you
must
touch
with
the
limb
the
neck
of
a
man
who
'
s
been
hanged
she
started
a
little
at
the
image
he
had
raised
'
before
he
is
cold
just
after
he
is
cut
down
continued
the
conjuror
impassively
'
how
can
that
do
good
'
it
will
turn
the
blood
and
change
the
constitution
but
as
i
say
to
do
it
is
hard
you
must
get
into
jail
and
wait
for
him
when
he
is
brought
off
the
gallows
lots
have
done
it
though
perhaps
not
such
pretty
women
as
you
i
used
to
send
dozens
for
skin
complaints
but
that
was
in
former
times
the
last
i
sent
was
in
13
near
twenty
years
ago
he
had
no
more
to
tell
her
and
when
he
had
put
her
into
a
straight
track
homeward
turned
and
left
her
refusing
all
money
as
at
first
the
communication
sank
deep
into
gertrude
'
s
mind
her
nature
was
rather
a
timid
one
and
probably
of
all
remedies
that
the
white
wizard
could
have
suggested
there
was
not
one
which
would
have
filled
her
with
so
much
aversion
as
this
not
to
speak
of
the
immense
obstacles
in
the
way
of
its
adoption
casterbridge
the
county
-
town
was
a
dozen
or
fifteen
miles
off
and
though
in
those
days
when
men
were
executed
for
horse
-
stealing
arson
and
burglary
an
assize
seldom
passed
without
a
hanging
it
was
not
likely
that
she
could
get
access
to
the
body
of
the
criminal
unaided
and
the
fear
of
her
husband
'
s
anger
made
her
reluctant
to
breathe
a
word
of
trendle
'
s
suggestion
to
him
or
to
anybody
about
him
she
did
nothing
for
months
and
patiently
bore
her
disfigurement
as
before
but
her
woman
'
s
nature
craving
for
renewed
love
through
the
medium
of
renewed
beauty
(
she
was
but
twenty
-
five
)
was
ever
stimulating
her
to
try
what
at
any
rate
could
hardly
do
her
any
harm
what
came
by
a
spell
will
go
by
a
spell
surely
she
would
say
whenever
her
imagination
pictured
the
act
she
shrank
in
terror
from
the
possibility
of
it
then
the
words
of
the
conjuror
it
will
turn
your
blood
were
seen
to
be
capable
of
a
scientific
no
less
than
a
ghastly
interpretation
the
mastering
desire
returned
and
urged
her
on
again
there
was
at
this
time
but
one
county
paper
and
that
her
husband
only
occasionally
borrowed
but
old
-
fashioned
days
had
old
-
fashioned
means
and
news
was
extensively
conveyed
by
word
of
mouth
from
market
to
market
or
from
fair
to
fair
so
that
whenever
such
an
event
as
an
execution
was
about
to
take
place
few
within
a
radius
of
twenty
miles
were
ignorant
of
the
coming
sight
and
so
far
as
holmstoke
was
concerned
some
enthusiasts
had
been
known
to
walk
all
the
way
to
casterbridge
and
back
in
one
day
solely
to
witness
the
spectacle
the
next
assizes
were
in
march
and
when
gertrude
lodge
heard
that
they
had
been
held
she
inquired
stealthily
at
the
inn
as
to
the
result
as
soon
as
she
could
find
opportunity
she
was
however
too
late
the
time
at
which
the
sentences
were
to
be
carried
out
had
arrived
and
to
make
the
journey
and
obtain
admission
at
such
short
notice
required
at
least
her
husband
'
s
assistance
she
dared
not
tell
him
for
she
had
found
by
delicate
experiment
that
these
smouldering
village
beliefs
made
him
furious
if
mentioned
partly
because
he
half
entertained
them
himself
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
wait
for
another
opportunity
her
determination
received
a
fillip
from
learning
that
two
epileptic
children
had
attended
from
this
very
village
of
holmstoke
many
years
before
with
beneficial
results
though
the
experiment
had
been
strongly
condemned
by
the
neighbouring
clergy
april
may
june
passed
and
it
is
no
overstatement
to
say
that
by
the
end
of
the
last
-
named
month
gertrude
well
-
nigh
longed
for
the
death
of
a
fellow
-
creature
instead
of
her
formal
prayers
each
night
her
unconscious
prayer
was
o
lord
hang
some
guilty
or
innocent
person
soon
this
time
she
made
earlier
inquiries
and
was
altogether
more
systematic
in
her
proceedings
moreover
the
season
was
summer
between
the
haymaking
and
the
harvest
and
in
the
leisure
thus
afforded
him
her
husband
had
been
holiday
-
taking
away
from
home
the
assizes
were
in
july
and
she
went
to
the
inn
as
before
there
was
to
be
one
execution
only
one
for
arson
her
greatest
problem
was
not
how
to
get
to
casterbridge
but
what
means
she
should
adopt
for
obtaining
admission
to
the
jail
though
access
for
such
purposes
had
formerly
never
been
denied
the
custom
had
fallen
into
desuetude
and
in
contemplating
her
possible
difficulties
she
was
again
almost
driven
to
fall
back
upon
her
husband
but
on
sounding
him
about
the
assizes
he
was
so
uncommunicative
so
more
than
usually
cold
that
she
did
not
proceed
and
decided
that
whatever
she
did
she
would
do
alone
fortune
obdurate
hitherto
showed
her
unexpected
favour
on
the
thursday
before
the
saturday
fixed
for
the
execution
lodge
remarked
to
her
that
he
was
going
away
from
home
for
another
day
or
two
on
business
at
a
fair
and
that
he
was
sorry
he
could
not
take
her
with
him
she
exhibited
on
this
occasion
so
much
readiness
to
stay
at
home
that
he
looked
at
her
in
surprise
time
had
been
when
she
would
have
shown
deep
disappointment
at
the
loss
of
such
a
jaunt
however
he
lapsed
into
his
usual
taciturnity
and
on
the
day
named
left
holmstoke
it
was
now
her
turn
she
at
first
had
thought
of
driving
but
on
reflection
held
that
driving
would
not
do
since
it
would
necessitate
her
keeping
to
the
turnpike
-
road
and
so
increase
by
tenfold
the
risk
of
her
ghastly
errand
being
found
out
she
decided
to
ride
and
avoid
the
beaten
track
notwithstanding
that
in
her
husband
'
s
stables
there
was
no
animal
just
at
present
which
by
any
stretch
of
imagination
could
be
considered
a
lady
'
s
mount
in
spite
of
his
promise
before
marriage
to
always
keep
a
mare
for
her
he
had
however
many
cart
-
horses
fine
ones
of
their
kind
and
among
the
rest
was
a
serviceable
creature
an
equine
amazon
with
a
back
as
broad
as
a
sofa
on
which
gertrude
had
occasionally
taken
an
airing
when
unwell
this
horse
she
chose
on
friday
afternoon
one
of
the
men
brought
it
round
she
was
dressed
and
before
going
down
looked
at
her
shrivelled
arm
ah
she
said
to
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
this
terrible
ordeal
would
have
been
saved
me
when
strapping
up
the
bundle
in
which
she
carried
a
few
articles
of
clothing
she
took
occasion
to
say
to
the
servant
i
take
these
in
case
i
should
not
get
back
to
-
night
from
the
person
i
am
going
to
visit
do
not
be
alarmed
if
i
am
not
in
by
ten
and
close
up
the
house
as
usual
i
shall
be
at
home
to
-
morrow
for
certain
she
meant
then
to
privately
tell
her
husband
the
deed
accomplished
was
not
like
the
deed
projected
he
would
almost
certainly
forgive
her
and
then
the
pretty
palpitating
gertrude
lodge
went
from
her
husband
'
s
homestead
but
though
her
goal
was
casterbridge
she
did
not
take
the
direct
route
thither
through
stickleford
her
cunning
course
at
first
was
in
precisely
the
opposite
direction
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
sight
however
she
turned
to
the
left
by
a
road
which
led
into
egdon
and
on
entering
the
heath
wheeled
round
and
set
out
in
the
true
course
due
westerly
a
more
private
way
down
the
county
could
not
be
imagined
and
as
to
direction
she
had
merely
to
keep
her
horse
'
s
head
to
a
point
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
sun
she
knew
that
she
would
light
upon
a
furze
-
cutter
or
cottager
of
some
sort
from
time
to
time
from
whom
she
might
correct
her
bearing
though
the
date
was
comparatively
recent
egdon
was
much
less
fragmentary
in
character
than
now
the
attempts
successful
and
otherwise
at
cultivation
on
the
lower
slopes
which
intrude
and
break
up
the
original
heath
into
small
detached
heaths
had
not
been
carried
far
enclosure
acts
had
not
taken
effect
and
the
banks
and
fences
which
now
exclude
the
cattle
of
those
villagers
who
formerly
enjoyed
rights
of
commonage
thereon
and
the
carts
of
those
who
had
turbary
privileges
which
kept
them
in
firing
all
the
year
round
were
not
erected
gertrude
therefore
rode
along
with
no
other
obstacles
than
the
prickly
furze
bushes
the
mats
of
heather
the
white
water
-
courses
and
the
natural
steeps
and
declivities
of
the
ground
her
horse
was
sure
if
heavy
-
footed
and
slow
and
though
a
draught
animal
was
easy
-
paced
had
it
been
otherwise
she
was
not
a
woman
who
could
have
ventured
to
ride
over
such
a
bit
of
country
with
a
half
-
dead
arm
it
was
therefore
nearly
eight
o
'
clock
when
she
drew
rein
to
breathe
the
mare
on
the
last
outlying
high
point
of
heath
-
land
towards
casterbridge
previous
to
leaving
egdon
for
the
cultivated
valleys
she
halted
before
a
pool
called
rushy
-
pond
flanked
by
the
ends
of
two
hedges
a
railing
ran
through
the
centre
of
the
pond
dividing
it
in
half
over
the
railing
she
saw
the
low
green
country
over
the
green
trees
the
roofs
of
the
town
over
the
roofs
a
white
flat
facade
denoting
the
entrance
to
the
county
jail
on
the
roof
of
this
front
specks
were
moving
about
they
seemed
to
be
workmen
erecting
something
her
flesh
crept
she
descended
slowly
and
was
soon
amid
corn
-
fields
and
pastures
in
another
half
-
hour
when
it
was
almost
dusk
gertrude
reached
the
white
hart
the
first
inn
of
the
town
on
that
side
little
surprise
was
excited
by
her
arrival
farmers
'
wives
rode
on
horseback
then
more
than
they
do
now
though
for
that
matter
mrs
lodge
was
not
imagined
to
be
a
wife
at
all
the
innkeeper
supposed
her
some
harum
-
skarum
young
woman
who
had
come
to
attend
hang
-
fair
'
next
day
neither
her
husband
nor
herself
ever
dealt
in
casterbridge
market
so
that
she
was
unknown
while
dismounting
she
beheld
a
crowd
of
boys
standing
at
the
door
of
a
harness
-
maker
'
s
shop
just
above
the
inn
looking
inside
it
with
deep
interest
'
what
is
going
on
there
she
asked
of
the
ostler
'
making
the
rope
for
to
-
morrow
she
throbbed
responsively
and
contracted
her
arm
'
'
tis
sold
by
the
inch
afterwards
the
man
continued
i
could
get
you
a
bit
miss
for
nothing
if
you
'
d
like
she
hastily
repudiated
any
such
wish
all
the
more
from
a
curious
creeping
feeling
that
the
condemned
wretch
'
s
destiny
was
becoming
interwoven
with
her
own
and
having
engaged
a
room
for
the
night
sat
down
to
think
up
to
this
time
she
had
formed
but
the
vaguest
notions
about
her
means
of
obtaining
access
to
the
prison
the
words
of
the
cunning
-
man
returned
to
her
mind
he
had
implied
that
she
should
use
her
beauty
impaired
though
it
was
as
a
pass
-
key
in
her
inexperience
she
knew
little
about
jail
functionaries
she
had
heard
of
a
high
-
sheriff
and
an
under
-
sheriff
but
dimly
only
she
knew
however
that
there
must
be
a
hangman
and
to
the
hangman
she
determined
to
apply
at
this
date
and
for
several
years
after
there
was
a
hangman
to
almost
every
jail
gertrude
found
on
inquiry
that
the
casterbridge
official
dwelt
in
a
lonely
cottage
by
a
deep
slow
river
flowing
under
the
cliff
on
which
the
prison
buildings
were
situate
the
stream
being
the
self
-
same
one
though
she
did
not
know
it
which
watered
the
stickleford
and
holmstoke
meads
lower
down
in
its
course
having
changed
her
dress
and
before
she
had
eaten
or
drunk
for
she
could
not
take
her
ease
till
she
had
ascertained
some
particulars
gertrude
pursued
her
way
by
a
path
along
the
water
-
side
to
the
cottage
indicated
passing
thus
the
outskirts
of
the
jail
she
discerned
on
the
level
roof
over
the
gateway
three
rectangular
lines
against
the
sky
where
the
specks
had
been
moving
in
her
distant
view
she
recognized
what
the
erection
was
and
passed
quickly
on
another
hundred
yards
brought
her
to
the
executioner
'
s
house
which
a
boy
pointed
out
it
stood
close
to
the
same
stream
and
was
hard
by
a
weir
the
waters
of
which
emitted
a
steady
roar
while
she
stood
hesitating
the
door
opened
and
an
old
man
came
forth
shading
a
candle
with
one
hand
locking
the
door
on
the
outside
he
turned
to
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
fixed
against
the
end
of
the
cottage
and
began
to
ascend
them
this
being
evidently
the
staircase
to
his
bedroom
gertrude
hastened
forward
but
by
the
time
she
reached
the
foot
of
the
ladder
he
was
at
the
top
she
called
to
him
loudly
enough
to
be
heard
above
the
roar
of
the
weir
he
looked
down
and
said
what
d
'
ye
want
here
'
to
speak
to
you
a
minute
the
candle
-
light
such
as
it
was
fell
upon
her
imploring
pale
upturned
face
and
davies
(
as
the
hangman
was
called
)
backed
down
the
ladder
i
was
just
going
to
bed
he
said
early
to
bed
and
early
to
rise
but
i
do
not
mind
stopping
a
minute
for
such
a
one
as
you
come
into
house
he
reopened
the
door
and
preceded
her
to
the
room
within
the
implements
of
his
daily
work
which
was
that
of
a
jobbing
gardener
stood
in
a
corner
and
seeing
probably
that
she
looked
rural
he
said
if
you
want
me
to
undertake
country
work
i
ca
not
come
for
i
never
leave
casterbridge
for
gentle
nor
simple
not
i
my
real
calling
is
officer
of
justice
he
added
formally
'
yes
yes
that
'
s
it
to
-
morrow
'
ah
i
thought
so
well
what
'
s
the
matter
about
that
tis
no
use
to
come
here
about
the
knot
folks
do
come
continually
but
i
tell
em
one
knot
is
as
merciful
as
another
if
ye
keep
it
under
the
ear
is
the
unfortunate
man
a
relation
or
i
should
say
perhaps
'
(
looking
at
her
dress
)
a
person
who
'
s
been
in
your
employ
'
no
what
time
is
the
execution
'
the
same
as
usual
twelve
o
'
clock
or
as
soon
after
as
the
london
mail
-
coach
gets
in
we
always
wait
for
that
in
case
of
a
reprieve
'
o
a
reprieve
i
hope
not
she
said
involuntarily
'
well
hee
hee
as
a
matter
of
business
so
do
i
but
still
if
ever
a
young
fellow
deserved
to
be
let
off
this
one
does
only
just
turned
eighteen
and
only
present
by
chance
when
the
rick
was
fired
howsomever
there
'
s
not
much
risk
of
it
as
they
are
obliged
to
make
an
example
of
him
there
having
been
so
much
destruction
of
property
that
way
lately
'
i
mean
she
explained
that
i
want
to
touch
him
for
a
charm
a
cure
of
an
affliction
by
the
advice
of
a
man
who
has
proved
the
virtue
of
the
remedy
'
o
yes
miss
now
i
understand
i
'
ve
had
such
people
come
in
past
years
but
it
did
not
strike
me
that
you
looked
of
a
sort
to
require
blood
-
turning
what
'
s
the
complaint
the
wrong
kind
for
this
i
will
be
bound
'
my
arm
she
reluctantly
showed
the
withered
skin
'
ah
tis
all
a
-
scram
said
the
hangman
examining
it
'
yes
said
she
'
well
he
continued
with
interest
that
is
the
class
o
'
subject
i
am
bound
to
admit
i
like
the
look
of
the
place
it
is
truly
as
suitable
for
the
cure
as
any
i
ever
saw
twas
a
knowing
-
man
that
sent
ee
whoever
he
was
'
you
can
contrive
for
me
all
that
'
s
necessary
she
said
breathlessly
'
you
should
really
have
gone
to
the
governor
of
the
jail
and
your
doctor
with
ee
and
given
your
name
and
address
that
'
s
how
it
used
to
be
done
if
i
recollect
still
perhaps
i
can
manage
it
for
a
trifling
fee
'
o
thank
you
i
would
rather
do
it
this
way
as
i
should
like
it
kept
private
'
lover
not
to
know
eh
'
no
husband
'
aha
very
well
i
will
get
ee
'
a
touch
of
the
corpse
'
where
is
it
now
she
said
shuddering
'
it
he
you
mean
he
is
living
yet
just
inside
that
little
small
winder
up
there
in
the
glum
he
signified
the
jail
on
the
cliff
above
she
thought
of
her
husband
and
her
friends
yes
of
course
she
said
and
how
am
i
to
proceed
he
took
her
to
the
door
now
do
you
be
waiting
at
the
little
wicket
in
the
wall
that
you
will
find
up
there
in
the
lane
not
later
than
one
o
'
clock
i
will
open
it
from
the
inside
as
i
sha
not
come
home
to
dinner
till
he
is
cut
down
good
-
night
be
punctual
and
if
you
do
not
want
anybody
to
know
ee
wear
a
veil
ah
once
i
had
such
a
daughter
as
you
she
went
away
and
climbed
the
path
above
to
assure
herself
that
she
would
be
able
to
find
the
wicket
next
day
its
outline
was
soon
visible
to
her
a
narrow
opening
in
the
outer
wall
of
the
prison
precincts
the
steep
was
so
great
that
having
reached
the
wicket
she
stopped
a
moment
to
breathe
and
looking
back
upon
the
water
-
side
cot
saw
the
hangman
again
ascending
his
outdoor
staircase
he
entered
the
loft
or
chamber
to
which
it
led
and
in
a
few
minutes
extinguished
his
light
the
town
clock
struck
ten
and
she
returned
to
the
white
hart
as
she
had
come
it
was
one
o
'
clock
on
saturday
gertrude
lodge
having
been
admitted
to
the
jail
as
above
described
was
sitting
in
a
waiting
-
room
within
the
second
gate
which
stood
under
a
classic
archway
of
ashlar
then
comparatively
modern
and
bearing
the
inscription
covnty
jail
1793
this
had
been
the
facade
she
saw
from
the
heath
the
day
before
near
at
hand
was
a
passage
to
the
roof
on
which
the
gallows
stood
the
town
was
thronged
and
the
market
suspended
but
gertrude
had
seen
scarcely
a
soul
having
kept
her
room
till
the
hour
of
the
appointment
she
had
proceeded
to
the
spot
by
a
way
which
avoided
the
open
space
below
the
cliff
where
the
spectators
had
gathered
but
she
could
even
now
hear
the
multitudinous
babble
of
their
voices
out
of
which
rose
at
intervals
the
hoarse
croak
of
a
single
voice
uttering
the
words
last
dying
speech
and
confession
there
had
been
no
reprieve
and
the
execution
was
over
but
the
crowd
still
waited
to
see
the
body
taken
down
soon
the
persistent
girl
heard
a
trampling
overhead
then
a
hand
beckoned
to
her
and
following
directions
she
went
out
and
crossed
the
inner
paved
court
beyond
the
gatehouse
her
knees
trembling
so
that
she
could
scarcely
walk
one
of
her
arms
was
out
of
its
sleeve
and
only
covered
by
her
shawl
on
the
spot
at
which
she
had
now
arrived
were
two
trestles
and
before
she
could
think
of
their
purpose
she
heard
heavy
feet
descending
stairs
somewhere
at
her
back
turn
her
head
she
would
not
or
could
not
and
rigid
in
this
position
she
was
conscious
of
a
rough
coffin
passing
her
shoulder
borne
by
four
men
it
was
open
and
in
it
lay
the
body
of
a
young
man
wearing
the
smockfrock
of
a
rustic
and
fustian
breeches
the
corpse
had
been
thrown
into
the
coffin
so
hastily
that
the
skirt
of
the
smockfrock
was
hanging
over
the
burden
was
temporarily
deposited
on
the
trestles
by
this
time
the
young
woman
'
s
state
was
such
that
a
gray
mist
seemed
to
float
before
her
eyes
on
account
of
which
and
the
veil
she
wore
she
could
scarcely
discern
anything
it
was
as
though
she
had
nearly
died
but
was
held
up
by
a
sort
of
galvanism
'
now
said
a
voice
close
at
hand
and
she
was
just
conscious
that
the
word
had
been
addressed
to
her
by
a
last
strenuous
effort
she
advanced
at
the
same
time
hearing
persons
approaching
behind
her
she
bared
her
poor
curst
arm
and
davies
uncovering
the
face
of
the
corpse
took
gertrude
'
s
hand
and
held
it
so
that
her
arm
lay
across
the
dead
man
'
s
neck
upon
a
line
the
colour
of
an
unripe
blackberry
which
surrounded
it
gertrude
shrieked
the
turn
o
'
the
blood
predicted
by
the
conjuror
had
taken
place
but
at
that
moment
a
second
shriek
rent
the
air
of
the
enclosure
it
was
not
gertrude
'
s
and
its
effect
upon
her
was
to
make
her
start
round
immediately
behind
her
stood
rhoda
brook
her
face
drawn
and
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
behind
rhoda
stood
gertrude
'
s
own
husband
his
countenance
lined
his
eyes
dim
but
without
a
tear
'
d
-
n
you
what
are
you
doing
here
he
said
hoarsely
'
hussy
to
come
between
us
and
our
child
now
cried
rhoda
this
is
the
meaning
of
what
satan
showed
me
in
the
vision
you
are
like
her
at
last
and
clutching
the
bare
arm
of
the
younger
woman
she
pulled
her
unresistingly
back
against
the
wall
immediately
brook
had
loosened
her
hold
the
fragile
young
gertrude
slid
down
against
the
feet
of
her
husband
when
he
lifted
her
up
she
was
unconscious
