a
person
who
differed
from
the
local
wayfarers
was
climbing
the
steep
road
which
leads
through
the
sea
-
skirted
townlet
definable
as
the
street
of
wells
and
forms
a
pass
into
that
gibraltar
of
wessex
the
singular
peninsula
once
an
island
and
still
called
such
that
stretches
out
like
the
head
of
a
bird
into
the
english
channel
it
is
connected
with
the
mainland
by
a
long
thin
neck
of
pebbles
cast
up
by
rages
of
the
se
and
unparalleled
in
its
kind
in
europe
the
pedestrian
was
what
he
looked
like
a
young
man
from
london
and
the
cities
of
the
continent
nobody
could
see
at
present
that
his
urbanism
sat
upon
him
only
as
a
garment
he
was
just
recollecting
with
something
of
self
-
reproach
that
a
whole
three
years
and
eight
months
had
flown
since
he
paid
his
last
visit
to
his
father
at
this
lonely
rock
of
his
birthplace
the
intervening
time
having
been
spent
amid
many
contrasting
societies
peoples
manners
and
scenes
what
had
seemed
usual
in
the
isle
when
he
lived
there
always
looked
quaint
and
odd
after
his
later
impressions
more
than
ever
the
spot
seemed
what
it
was
said
once
to
have
been
the
ancient
vindilia
island
and
the
home
of
the
slingers
the
towering
rock
the
houses
above
houses
one
man
'
s
doorstep
rising
behind
his
neighbour
'
s
chimney
the
gardens
hung
up
by
one
edge
to
the
sky
the
vegetables
growing
on
apparently
almost
vertical
planes
the
unity
of
the
whole
island
as
a
solid
and
single
block
of
limestone
four
miles
long
were
no
longer
familiar
and
commonplace
ideas
all
now
stood
dazzlingly
unique
and
white
against
the
tinted
sea
and
the
sun
flashed
on
infinitely
stratified
walls
of
oolite
the
melancholy
ruins
of
cancelled
cycles
with
a
distinctiveness
that
called
the
eyes
to
it
as
strongly
as
any
spectacle
he
had
beheld
afar
after
a
laborious
clamber
he
reached
the
top
and
walked
along
the
plateau
towards
the
eastern
village
the
time
being
about
two
o
'
clock
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
season
the
road
was
glaring
and
dusty
and
drawing
near
to
his
father
'
s
house
he
sat
down
in
the
sun
he
stretched
out
his
hand
upon
the
rock
beside
him
it
felt
warm
that
was
the
island
'
s
personal
temperature
when
in
its
afternoon
sleep
as
now
he
listened
and
heard
sounds
whirr
-
whirr
saw
-
saw
-
saw
those
were
the
island
'
s
snores
the
noises
of
the
quarrymen
and
stone
-
sawyers
opposite
to
the
spot
on
which
he
sat
was
a
roomy
cottage
or
homestead
like
the
island
it
was
all
of
stone
not
only
in
walls
but
in
window
-
frames
roof
chimneys
fence
stile
pigsty
and
stable
almost
door
he
remembered
who
had
used
to
live
there
and
probably
lived
there
now
the
caro
family
the
'
roan
-
mare
'
caros
as
they
were
called
to
distinguish
them
from
other
branches
of
the
same
pedigree
there
being
but
half
-
a
-
dozen
christian
and
surnames
in
the
whole
island
he
crossed
the
road
and
looked
in
at
the
open
doorway
yes
there
they
were
still
mrs
caro
who
had
seen
him
from
the
window
met
him
in
the
entry
and
an
old
-
fashioned
greeting
took
place
between
them
a
moment
after
a
door
leading
from
the
back
rooms
was
thrown
open
and
a
young
girl
about
seventeen
or
eighteen
came
bounding
in
'
why
tis
dear
joce
she
burst
out
joyfully
and
running
up
to
the
young
man
she
kissed
him
the
demonstration
was
sweet
enough
from
the
owner
of
such
an
affectionate
pair
of
bright
hazel
eyes
and
brown
tresses
of
hair
but
it
was
so
sudden
so
unexpected
by
a
man
fresh
from
towns
that
he
winced
for
a
moment
quite
involuntarily
and
there
was
some
constraint
in
the
manner
in
which
he
returned
her
kiss
and
said
my
pretty
little
avice
how
do
you
do
after
so
long
for
a
few
seconds
her
impulsive
innocence
hardly
noticed
his
start
of
surprise
but
mrs
caro
the
girl
'
s
mother
had
observed
it
instantly
with
a
pained
flush
she
turned
to
her
daughter
'
avice
my
dear
avice
why
what
are
you
doing
do
not
you
know
that
you
'
ve
grown
up
to
be
a
woman
since
jocelyn
mr
pierston
was
last
down
here
of
course
you
must
not
do
now
as
you
used
to
do
three
or
four
years
ago
the
awkwardness
which
had
arisen
was
hardly
removed
by
pierston
'
s
assurance
that
he
quite
expected
her
to
keep
up
the
practice
of
her
childhood
followed
by
several
minutes
of
conversation
on
general
subjects
he
was
vexed
from
his
soul
that
his
unaware
movement
should
so
have
betrayed
him
at
his
leaving
he
repeated
that
if
avice
regarded
him
otherwise
than
as
she
used
to
do
he
would
never
forgive
her
but
though
they
parted
good
friends
her
regret
at
the
incident
was
visible
in
her
face
jocelyn
passed
out
into
the
road
and
onward
to
his
father
'
s
house
hard
by
the
mother
and
daughter
were
left
alone
'
i
was
quite
amazed
at
'
ee
my
child
exclaimed
the
elder
a
young
man
from
london
and
foreign
cities
used
now
to
the
strictest
company
manners
and
ladies
who
almost
think
it
vulgar
to
smile
broad
how
could
ye
do
it
avice
'
i
i
did
not
think
about
how
i
was
altered
said
the
conscience
-
stricken
girl
i
used
to
kiss
him
and
he
used
to
kiss
me
before
he
went
away
'
but
that
was
years
ago
my
dear
'
o
yes
and
for
the
moment
i
forgot
he
seemed
just
the
same
to
me
as
he
used
to
be
'
well
it
ca
not
be
helped
now
you
must
be
careful
in
the
future
he
is
got
lots
of
young
women
i
will
warrant
and
has
few
thoughts
left
for
you
he
is
what
they
call
a
sculptor
and
he
means
to
be
a
great
genius
in
that
line
some
day
they
do
say
'
well
i
'
ve
done
it
and
it
ca
not
be
mended
moaned
the
girl
meanwhile
jocelyn
pierston
the
sculptor
of
budding
fame
had
gone
onward
to
the
house
of
his
father
an
inartistic
man
of
trade
and
commerce
merely
from
whom
nevertheless
jocelyn
condescended
to
accept
a
yearly
allowance
pending
the
famous
days
to
come
but
the
elder
having
received
no
warning
of
his
son
'
s
intended
visit
was
not
at
home
to
receive
him
jocelyn
looked
round
the
familiar
premises
glanced
across
the
common
at
the
great
yards
within
which
eternal
saws
were
going
to
and
fro
upon
eternal
blocks
of
stone
the
very
same
saws
and
the
very
same
blocks
that
he
had
seen
there
when
last
in
the
island
so
it
seemed
to
him
and
then
passed
through
the
dwelling
into
the
back
garden
like
all
the
gardens
in
the
isle
it
was
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
dry
-
jointed
spawls
and
at
its
further
extremity
it
ran
out
into
a
corner
which
adjoined
the
garden
of
the
caros
he
had
no
sooner
reached
this
spot
than
he
became
aware
of
a
murmuring
and
sobbing
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
the
voice
he
recognized
in
a
moment
as
avice
'
s
and
she
seemed
to
be
confiding
her
trouble
to
some
young
friend
of
her
own
sex
'
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
she
was
saying
bitterly
so
bold
as
it
was
so
shameless
how
could
i
think
of
such
a
thing
he
will
never
forgive
me
never
never
like
me
again
he
will
think
me
a
forward
hussy
and
yet
and
yet
i
quite
forgot
how
much
i
had
grown
but
that
he
will
never
believe
the
accents
were
those
of
one
who
had
for
the
first
time
become
conscious
of
her
womanhood
as
an
unwonted
possession
which
shamed
and
frightened
her
'
did
he
seem
angry
at
it
inquired
the
friend
'
o
no
not
angry
worse
cold
and
haughty
o
he
is
such
a
fashionable
person
now
not
at
all
an
island
man
but
there
'
s
no
use
in
talking
of
it
i
wish
i
was
dead
pierston
retreated
as
quickly
as
he
could
he
grieved
at
the
incident
which
had
brought
such
pain
to
this
innocent
soul
and
yet
it
was
beginning
to
be
a
source
of
vague
pleasure
to
him
he
returned
to
the
house
and
when
his
father
had
come
back
and
welcomed
him
and
they
had
shared
a
meal
together
jocelyn
again
went
out
full
of
an
earnest
desire
to
soothe
his
young
neighbour
'
s
sorrow
in
a
way
she
little
expected
though
to
tell
the
truth
his
affection
for
her
was
rather
that
of
a
friend
than
of
a
lover
and
he
felt
by
no
means
sure
that
the
migratory
elusive
idealization
he
called
his
love
who
ever
since
his
boyhood
had
flitted
from
human
shell
to
human
shell
an
indefinite
number
of
times
was
going
to
take
up
her
abode
in
the
body
of
avice
caro
it
was
difficult
to
meet
her
again
even
though
on
this
lump
of
rock
the
difficulty
lay
as
a
rule
rather
in
avoidance
than
in
meeting
but
avice
had
been
transformed
into
a
very
different
kind
of
young
woman
by
the
self
-
consciousness
engendered
of
her
impulsive
greeting
and
notwithstanding
their
near
neighbourhood
he
could
not
encounter
her
try
as
he
would
no
sooner
did
he
appear
an
inch
beyond
his
father
'
s
door
than
she
was
to
earth
like
a
fox
she
bolted
upstairs
to
her
room
anxious
to
soothe
her
after
his
unintentional
slight
he
could
not
stand
these
evasions
long
the
manners
of
the
isle
were
primitive
and
straightforward
even
among
the
well
-
to
-
do
and
noting
her
disappearance
one
day
he
followed
her
into
the
house
and
onward
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
'
avice
he
called
'
yes
mr
pierston
'
why
do
you
run
upstairs
like
that
'
oh
only
because
i
wanted
to
come
up
for
something
'
well
if
you
'
ve
got
it
ca
not
you
come
down
again
'
no
i
ca
not
very
well
'
come
dear
avice
that
'
s
what
you
are
you
know
there
was
no
response
'
well
if
you
wo
not
you
wo
not
he
continued
i
do
not
want
to
bother
you
and
pierston
went
away
he
was
stopping
to
look
at
the
old
-
fashioned
flowers
under
the
garden
walls
when
he
heard
a
voice
behind
him
'
mr
pierston
i
was
not
angry
with
you
when
you
were
gone
i
thought
you
might
mistake
me
and
i
felt
i
could
do
no
less
than
come
and
assure
you
of
my
friendship
still
turning
he
saw
the
blushing
avice
immediately
behind
him
'
you
are
a
good
dear
girl
said
he
and
seizing
her
hand
set
upon
her
cheek
the
kind
of
kiss
that
should
have
been
the
response
to
hers
on
the
day
of
his
coming
'
darling
avice
forgive
me
for
the
slight
that
day
say
you
do
come
now
and
then
i
will
say
to
you
what
i
have
never
said
to
any
other
woman
living
or
dead
will
you
have
me
as
your
husband
'
ah
mother
says
i
am
only
one
of
many
'
you
are
not
dear
you
knew
me
when
i
was
young
and
others
did
not
somehow
or
other
her
objections
were
got
over
and
though
she
did
not
give
an
immediate
assent
she
agreed
to
meet
him
later
in
the
afternoon
when
she
walked
with
him
to
the
southern
point
of
the
island
called
the
beal
or
by
strangers
the
bill
pausing
over
the
treacherous
cavern
known
as
cave
hole
into
which
the
sea
roared
and
splashed
now
as
it
had
done
when
they
visited
it
together
as
children
to
steady
herself
while
looking
in
he
offered
her
his
arm
and
she
took
it
for
the
first
time
as
a
woman
for
the
hundredth
time
as
his
companion
they
rambled
on
to
the
lighthouse
where
they
would
have
lingered
longer
if
avice
had
not
suddenly
remembered
an
engagement
to
recite
poetry
from
a
platform
that
very
evening
at
the
street
of
wells
the
village
commanding
the
entrance
to
the
island
the
village
that
has
now
advanced
to
be
a
town
'
recite
said
he
who
'
d
have
thought
anybody
or
anything
could
recite
down
here
except
the
reciter
we
hear
away
there
the
never
speechless
sea
'
o
but
we
are
quite
intellectual
now
in
the
winter
particularly
but
jocelyn
do
not
come
to
the
recitation
will
you
it
would
spoil
my
performance
if
you
were
there
and
i
want
to
be
as
good
as
the
rest
'
i
wo
not
if
you
really
wish
me
not
to
but
i
shall
meet
you
at
the
door
and
bring
you
home
'
yes
she
said
looking
up
into
his
face
avice
was
perfectly
happy
now
she
could
never
have
believed
on
that
mortifying
day
of
his
coming
that
she
would
be
so
happy
with
him
when
they
reached
the
east
side
of
the
isle
they
parted
that
she
might
be
soon
enough
to
take
her
place
on
the
platform
pierston
went
home
and
after
dark
when
it
was
about
the
hour
for
accompanying
her
back
he
went
along
the
middle
road
northward
to
the
street
of
wells
he
was
full
of
misgiving
he
had
known
avice
caro
so
well
of
old
that
his
feeling
for
her
now
was
rather
comradeship
than
love
and
what
he
had
said
to
her
in
a
moment
of
impulse
that
morning
rather
appalled
him
in
its
consequences
not
that
any
of
the
more
sophisticated
and
accomplished
women
who
had
attracted
him
successively
would
be
likely
to
rise
inconveniently
between
them
for
he
had
quite
disabused
his
mind
of
the
assumption
that
the
idol
of
his
fancy
was
an
integral
part
of
the
personality
in
which
it
had
sojourned
for
a
long
or
a
short
while
to
his
well
-
beloved
he
had
always
been
faithful
but
she
had
had
many
embodiments
each
individuality
known
as
lucy
jane
flora
evangeline
or
what
-
not
had
been
merely
a
transient
condition
of
her
he
did
not
recognize
this
as
an
excuse
or
as
a
defence
but
as
a
fact
simply
essentially
she
was
perhaps
of
no
tangible
substance
a
spirit
a
dream
a
frenzy
a
conception
an
aroma
an
epitomized
sex
a
light
of
the
eye
a
parting
of
the
lips
god
only
knew
what
she
really
was
pierston
did
not
she
was
indescribable
never
much
considering
that
she
was
a
subjective
phenomenon
vivified
by
the
weird
influences
of
his
descent
and
birthplace
the
discovery
of
her
ghostliness
of
her
independence
of
physical
laws
and
failings
had
occasionally
given
him
a
sense
of
fear
he
never
knew
where
she
next
would
be
whither
she
would
lead
him
having
herself
instant
access
to
all
ranks
and
classes
to
every
abode
of
men
sometimes
at
night
he
dreamt
that
she
was
'
the
wile
-
weaving
daughter
of
high
zeus
'
in
person
bent
on
tormenting
him
for
his
sins
against
her
beauty
in
his
art
the
implacable
aphrodite
herself
indeed
he
knew
that
he
loved
the
masquerading
creature
wherever
he
found
her
whether
with
blue
eyes
black
eyes
or
brown
whether
presenting
herself
as
tall
fragile
or
plump
she
was
never
in
two
places
at
once
but
hitherto
she
had
never
been
in
one
place
long
by
making
this
clear
to
his
mind
some
time
before
to
-
day
he
had
escaped
a
good
deal
of
ugly
self
-
reproach
it
was
simply
that
she
who
always
attracted
him
and
led
him
whither
she
would
as
by
a
silken
thread
had
not
remained
the
occupant
of
the
same
fleshly
tabernacle
in
her
career
so
far
whether
she
would
ultimately
settle
down
to
one
he
could
not
say
had
he
felt
that
she
was
becoming
manifest
in
avice
he
would
have
tried
to
believe
that
this
was
the
terminal
spot
of
her
migrations
and
have
been
content
to
abide
by
his
words
but
did
he
see
the
well
-
beloved
in
avice
at
all
the
question
was
somewhat
disturbing
he
had
reached
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
descended
towards
the
village
where
in
the
long
straight
roman
street
he
soon
found
the
lighted
hall
the
performance
was
not
yet
over
and
by
going
round
to
the
side
of
the
building
and
standing
on
a
mound
he
could
see
the
interior
as
far
down
as
the
platform
level
avice
'
s
turn
or
second
turn
came
on
almost
immediately
her
pretty
embarrassment
on
facing
the
audience
rather
won
him
away
from
his
doubts
she
was
in
truth
what
is
called
a
'
nice
'
girl
attractive
certainly
but
above
all
things
nice
one
of
the
class
with
whom
the
risks
of
matrimony
approximate
most
nearly
to
zero
her
intelligent
eyes
her
broad
forehead
her
thoughtful
carriage
ensured
one
thing
that
of
all
the
girls
he
had
known
he
had
never
met
one
with
more
charming
and
solid
qualities
than
avice
caro
'
s
this
was
not
a
mere
conjecture
he
had
known
her
long
and
thoroughly
her
every
mood
and
temper
a
heavy
wagon
passing
without
drowned
her
small
soft
voice
for
him
but
the
audience
were
pleased
and
she
blushed
at
their
applause
he
now
took
his
station
at
the
door
and
when
the
people
had
done
pouring
out
he
found
her
within
awaiting
him
they
climbed
homeward
slowly
by
the
old
road
pierston
dragging
himself
up
the
steep
by
the
wayside
hand
-
rail
and
pulling
avice
after
him
upon
his
arm
at
the
top
they
turned
and
stood
still
to
the
left
of
them
the
sky
was
streaked
like
a
fan
with
the
lighthouse
rays
and
under
their
front
at
periods
of
a
quarter
of
a
minute
there
arose
a
deep
hollow
stroke
like
the
single
beat
of
a
drum
the
intervals
being
filled
with
a
long
-
drawn
rattling
as
of
bones
between
huge
canine
jaws
it
came
from
the
vast
concave
of
deadman
'
s
bay
rising
and
falling
against
the
pebble
dyke
the
evening
and
night
winds
here
were
to
pierston
'
s
mind
charged
with
a
something
that
did
not
burden
them
elsewhere
they
brought
it
up
from
that
sinister
bay
to
the
west
whose
movement
she
and
he
were
hearing
now
it
was
a
presence
an
imaginary
shape
or
essence
from
the
human
multitude
lying
below
those
who
had
gone
down
in
vessels
of
war
east
indiamen
barges
brigs
and
ships
of
the
armada
select
people
common
and
debased
whose
interests
and
hopes
had
been
as
wide
asunder
as
the
poles
but
who
had
rolled
each
other
to
oneness
on
that
restless
sea
-
bed
there
could
almost
be
felt
the
brush
of
their
huge
composite
ghost
as
it
ran
a
shapeless
figure
over
the
isle
shrieking
for
some
good
god
who
would
disunite
it
again
the
twain
wandered
a
long
way
that
night
amid
these
influences
so
far
as
to
the
old
hope
churchyard
which
lay
in
a
ravine
formed
by
a
landslip
ages
ago
the
church
had
slipped
down
with
the
rest
of
the
cliff
and
had
long
been
a
ruin
it
seemed
to
say
that
in
this
last
local
stronghold
of
the
pagan
divinities
where
pagan
customs
lingered
yet
christianity
had
established
itself
precariously
at
best
in
that
solemn
spot
pierston
kissed
her
the
kiss
was
by
no
means
on
avice
'
s
initiative
this
time
her
former
demonstrativeness
seemed
to
have
increased
her
present
reserve
that
day
was
the
beginning
of
a
pleasant
month
passed
mainly
in
each
other
'
s
society
he
found
that
she
could
not
only
recite
poetry
at
intellectual
gatherings
but
play
the
piano
fairly
and
sing
to
her
own
accompaniment
he
observed
that
every
aim
of
those
who
had
brought
her
up
had
been
to
get
her
away
mentally
as
far
as
possible
from
her
natural
and
individual
life
as
an
inhabitant
of
a
peculiar
island
to
make
her
an
exact
copy
of
tens
of
thousands
of
other
people
in
whose
circumstances
there
was
nothing
special
distinctive
or
picturesque
to
teach
her
to
forget
all
the
experiences
of
her
ancestors
to
drown
the
local
ballads
by
songs
purchased
at
the
budmouth
fashionable
music
-
sellers
'
and
the
local
vocabulary
by
a
governess
-
tongue
of
no
country
at
all
she
lived
in
a
house
that
would
have
been
the
fortune
of
an
artist
and
learnt
to
draw
london
suburban
villas
from
printed
copies
avice
had
seen
all
this
before
he
pointed
it
out
but
with
a
girl
'
s
tractability
had
acquiesced
by
constitution
she
was
local
to
the
bone
but
she
could
not
escape
the
tendency
of
the
age
the
time
for
jocelyn
'
s
departure
drew
near
and
she
looked
forward
to
it
sadly
but
serenely
their
engagement
being
now
a
settled
thing
pierston
thought
of
the
native
custom
on
such
occasions
which
had
prevailed
in
his
and
her
family
for
centuries
both
being
of
the
old
stock
of
the
isle
the
influx
of
'
kimberlins
or
'
foreigners
'
(
as
strangers
from
the
mainland
of
wessex
were
called
)
had
led
in
a
large
measure
to
its
discontinuance
but
underneath
the
veneer
of
avice
'
s
education
many
an
old
-
fashioned
idea
lay
slumbering
and
he
wondered
if
in
her
natural
melancholy
at
his
leaving
she
regretted
the
changing
manners
which
made
unpopular
the
formal
ratification
of
a
betrothal
according
to
the
precedent
of
their
sires
and
grandsires
'
well
said
he
here
we
are
arrived
at
the
fag

end
of
my
holiday
what
a
pleasant
surprise
my
old
home
which
i
have
not
thought
worth
coming
to
see
for
three
or
four
years
had
in
store
for
me
'
you
must
go
to
-
morrow
she
asked
uneasily
'
yes
something
seemed
to
overweigh
them
something
more
than
the
natural
sadness
of
a
parting
which
was
not
to
be
long
and
he
decided
that
instead
of
leaving
in
the
daytime
as
he
had
intended
he
would
defer
his
departure
till
night
and
go
by
the
mail
-
train
from
budmouth
this
would
give
him
time
to
look
into
his
father
'
s
quarries
and
enable
her
if
she
chose
to
walk
with
him
along
the
beach
as
far
as
to
henry
the
eighth
'
s
castle
above
the
sands
where
they
could
linger
and
watch
the
moon
rise
over
the
sea
she
said
she
thought
she
could
come
so
after
spending
the
next
day
with
his
father
in
the
quarries
jocelyn
prepared
to
leave
and
at
the
time
appointed
set
out
from
the
stone
house
of
his
birth
in
this
stone
isle
to
walk
to
budmouth
-
regis
by
the
path
along
the
beach
avice
having
some
time
earlier
gone
down
to
see
some
friends
in
the
street
of
wells
which
was
halfway
towards
the
spot
of
their
tryst
the
descent
soon
brought
him
to
the
pebble
bank
and
leaving
behind
him
the
last
houses
of
the
isle
and
the
ruins
of
the
village
destroyed
by
the
november
gale
of
1824
he
struck
out
along
the
narrow
thread
of
land
when
he
had
walked
a
hundred
yards
he
stopped
turned
aside
to
the
pebble
ridge
which
walled
out
the
sea
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
her
between
him
and
the
lights
of
the
ships

at
anchor
in
the
roadstead

men
passed
slowly
in

direction

intended
to
pursue

meanwhile
the
subject
of
their
remarks
waited
at
the
appointed
place
till
seven
o
'
clock
the
hour
named
between
himself
and
his
affianced
had
struck
almost
at
the
moment
he
saw
a
figure
coming
forward
from
the
last
lamp
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
but
the
figure
speedily
resolved
itself
into
that
of
a
boy
who
advancing
to
jocelyn
inquired
if
he
were
mr
pierston
and
handed
him
a
note
when
the
boy
had
gone
jocelyn
retraced
his
steps
to
the
last
lamp
and
read
in
avice
'
s
hand
'
my
dearest
i
shall
be
sorry
if
i
grieve
you

all
in
what
i
am
going
to
say
about
our
arrangement
to
meet
to
-
night
in
the
sandsfoot
ruin
but
i
have
fancied
that
my
seeing
you
again
and
again
lately
is
inclining
your
father
to
insist
and
you
as
his
heir
to
feel
that
we
ought
to
carry
out
island
custom
in
our
courting
your
people
being
such
old
inhabitants
in
an
unbroken
line
truth
to
say
mother
supposes
that
your
father
for
natural
reasons
may
have
hinted
to
you
that
we
ought
now
the
thing
is
contrary
to
my
feelings
it
is
nearly
left
off
and
i
do
not
think
it
good
even
where
there
is
property
as
in
your
case
to
justify
it
in
a
measure
i
would
rather
trust
in
providence
'
on
the
whole
therefore
it
is
best
that
i
should
not
come
if
only
for
appearances
and
meet
you
at
a
time
and
place
suggesting
the
custom
to
others
than
ourselves
at
least
if
known
'
i
am
sure
that
this
decision
will
not
disturb
you
much
that
you
will
understand
my
modern
feelings
and
think
no
worse
of
me
for
them
and
dear
if
it
were
to
be
done
and
we
were
unfortunate
in
it
we
might
both
have
enough
old
family
feeling
to
think
like
our
forefathers
and
possibly
your
father
that
we
could
not
marry
honourably
and
hence
we
might
be
made
unhappy
'
however
you
will
come
again
shortly
will
you
not
dear
jocelyn
and
then
the
time
will
soon
draw
on
when
no
more
good

byes
will
be
required
always
and
ever
yours
avice
jocelyn
having
read
the
letter
was
surprised
at
the
naivete
it
showed
and
at
avice
and
her
mother
'
s
antiquated
simplicity
in
supposing
that
to
be
still
a
grave
and
operating
principle
which
was
a
bygone
barbarism
to
himself
and
other
absentees
from
the
island
his
father
as
a
money
-
maker
might
have
practical
wishes
on
the
matter
of
descendants
which
lent
plausibility
to
the
conjecture
of
avice
and
her
mother
but
to
jocelyn
he
had
never
expressed
himself
in
favour
of
the
ancient
ways
old
-
fashioned
as
he
was
amused
therefore
at
her
regard
of
herself
as
modern
jocelyn
was
disappointed
and
a
little
vexed
that
such
an
unforeseen
reason
should
have
deprived
him
of
her
company
how
the
old
ideas
survived
under
the
new
education
the
reader
is
asked
to
remember
that
the
date
though
recent
in
the
history
of
the
isle
of
slingers
was
more
than
forty
years
ago
finding
that
the
evening
seemed
louring
yet
indisposed
to
go
back
and
hire
a
vehicle
he
went
on
quickly
alone
in
such
an
exposed
spot
the
night
wind
was
gusty
and
the
sea
behind
the
pebble
barrier
kicked
and
flounced
in
complex
rhythms
which
could
be
translated
equally
well
as
shocks
of
battle
or
shouts
of
thanksgiving
presently
on
the
pale
road
before
him
he
discerned
a
figure
the
figure
of
a
woman
he
remembered
that
a
woman
passed
him
while
he
was
reading
avice
'
s
letter
by
the
last
lamp
and
now
he
was
overtaking
her
he
did
hope
for
a
moment
that
it
might
be
avice
with
a
changed
mind
but
it
was
not
she
nor
anybody
like
her
it
was
a
taller
squarer
form
than
that
of
his
betrothed
and
although
the
season
was
only
autumn
she
was
wrapped
in
furs
or
in
thick
and
heavy
clothing
of
some
kind
he
soon
advanced
abreast
of
her
and
could
get
glimpses
of
her
profile
against
the
roadstead
lights
it
was
dignified
arresting
that
of
a
very
juno
nothing
more
classical
had
he
ever
seen
she
walked
at
a
swinging
pace
yet
with
such
ease
and
power
that
there
was
but
little
difference
in
their
rate
of
speed
for
several
minutes
and
during
this
time
he
regarded
and
conjectured
however
he
was
about
to
pass
her
by
when
she
suddenly
turned
and
addressed
him
'
mr
pierston
i
think
of
east
quarriers
he
assented
and
could
just
discern
what
a
handsome
commanding
imperious
face
it
was
quite
of
a
piece
with
the
proud
tones
of
her
voice
she
was
a
new
type
altogether
in
his
experience
and
her
accent
was
not
so
local
as
avice
'
s
'
can
you
tell
me
the
time
please
he
looked
at
his
watch
by
the
aid
of
a
light
and
in
telling
her
that
it
was
a
quarter
past
seven
observed
by
the
momentary
gleam
of
his
match
that
her
eyes
looked
a
little
red
and
chafed
as
if
with
weeping
'
mr
pierston
will
you
forgive
what
will
appear
very
strange
to
you
i
dare
say
that
is
may
i
ask
you
to
lend
me
some
money
for
a
day
or
two
i
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
leave
my
purse
on
the
dressing
-
table
it
did
appear
strange
and
yet
there
were
features
in
the
young
lady
'
s
personality
which
assured
him
in
a
moment
that
she
was
not
an
impostor
he
yielded
to
her
request
and
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
here
it
remained
for
a
moment
how
much
did
she
mean
by
the
words
'
some
money
'
the
junonian
quality
of
her
form
and
manner
made
him
throw
himself
by
an
impulse
into
harmony
with
her
and
he
responded
regally
he
scented
a
romance
he
handed
her
five
pounds
his
munificence
caused
her
no
apparent
surprise
it
is
quite
enough
thank
you
she
remarked
quietly
as
he
announced
the
sum
lest
she
should
be
unable
to
see
it
for
herself
while
overtaking
and
conversing
with
her
he
had
not
observed
that
the
rising
wind
which
had
proceeded
from
puffing
to
growling
and
from
growling
to
screeching
with
the
accustomed
suddenness
of
its
changes
here
had
at
length
brought
what
it
promised
by
these
vagaries
rain
the
drops
which
had
at
first
hit
their
left
cheeks
like
the
pellets
of
a
popgun
soon
assumed
the
character
of
a
raking
fusillade
from
the
bank
adjoining
one
shot
of
which
was
sufficiently
smart
to
go
through
jocelyn
'
s
sleeve
the
tall
girl
turned
and
seemed
to
be
somewhat
concerned
at
an
onset
which
she
had
plainly
not
foreseen
before
her
starting
'
we
must
take
shelter
said
jocelyn
'
but
where
said
she
to
windward
was
the
long
monotonous
bank
too
obtusely
piled
to
afford
a
screen
over
which
they
could
hear
the
canine
crunching
of
pebbles
by
the
sea
without
on
their
right
stretched
the
inner
bay
or
roadstead
the
distant
riding
-
lights
of
the
ships
now
dim
and
glimmering
behind
them
a
faint
spark
here
and
there
in
the
lower
sky
showed
where
the
island
rose
before
there
was
nothing
definite
and
could
be
nothing
till
they
reached
a
precarious
wood
bridge
a
mile
further
on
henry
the
eighth
'
s
castle
being
a
little
further
still
but
just
within
the
summit
of
the
bank
whither
it
had
apparently
been
hauled
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
waves
was
one
of
the
local
boats
called
lerrets
bottom
upwards
as
soon
as
they
saw
it
the
pair
ran
up
the
pebbly
slope
towards
it
by
a
simultaneous
impulse
they
then
perceived
that
it
had
lain
there
a
long
time
and
were
comforted
to
find
it
capable
of
affording
more
protection
than
anybody
would
have
expected
from
a
distant
view
it
formed
a
shelter
or
store
for
the
fishermen
the
bottom
of
the
lerret
being
tarred
as
a
roof
by
creeping
under
the
bows
which
overhung
the
bank
on
props
to
leeward
they
made
their
way
within
where
upon
some
thwarts
oars
and
other
fragmentary
woodwork
lay
a
mass
of
dry
netting
a
whole
sein
upon
this
they
scrambled
and
sat
down
through
inability
to
stand
upright
the
rain
fell
upon
the
keel
of
the
old
lerret
like
corn
thrown
in
handfuls
by
some
colossal
sower
and
darkness
set
in
to
its
full
shade
they
crouched
so
close
to
each
other
that
he
could
feel
her
furs
against
him
neither
had
spoken
since
they
left
the
roadway
till
she
said
with
attempted
unconcern
this
is
unfortunate
he
admitted
that
it
was
and
found
after
a
few
further
remarks
had
passed
that
she
certainly
had
been
weeping
there
being
a
suppressed
gasp
of
passionateness
in
her
utterance
now
and
then
'
it
is
more
unfortunate
for
you
perhaps
than
for
me
he
said
and
i
am
very
sorry
that
it
should
be
so
she
replied
nothing
to
this
and
he
added
that
it
was
rather
a
desolate
place
for
a
woman
alone
and
afoot
he
hoped
nothing
serious
had
happened
to
drag
her
out
at
such
an
untoward
time
at
first
she
seemed
not
at
all
disposed
to
show
any
candour
on
her
own
affairs
and
he
was
left
to
conjecture
as
to
her
history
and
name
and
how
she
could
possibly
have
known
him
but
as
the
rain
gave
not
the
least
sign
of
cessation
he
observed
i
think
we
shall
have
to
go
back
'
never
said
she
and
the
firmness
with
which
she
closed
her
lips
was
audible
in
the
word
'
why
not
he
inquired
'
there
are
good
reasons
'
i
cannot
understand
how
you
should
know
me
while
i
have
no
knowledge
of
you
'
oh
but
you
know
me
about
me
at
least
'
indeed
i
do
not
how
should
i
you
are
a
kimberlin
'
i
am
not
i
am
a
real
islander
or
was
rather
have
not
you
heard
of
the
best
-
bed
stone
company
'
i
should
think
so
they
tried
to
ruin
my
father
by
getting
away
his
trade
or
at
least
the
founder
of
the
company
did
old
bencomb
'
he
is
my
father
'
indeed
i
am
sorry
i
should
have
spoken
so
disrespectfully
of
him
for
i
never
knew
him
personally
after
making
over
his
large
business
to
the
company
he
retired
i
believe
to
london
'
yes
our
house
or
rather
his
not
mine
is
at
south
kensington
we
have
lived
there
for
years
but
we
have
been
tenants
of
sylvania
castle
on
the
island
here
this
season
we
took
it
for
a
month
or
two
of
the
owner
who
is
away
'
then
i
have
been
staying
quite
near
you
miss
bencomb
my
father
'
s
is
a
comparatively
humble
residence
hard
by
'
but
he
could
afford
a
much
bigger
one
if
he
chose
'
you
have
heard
so
i
do
not
know
he
does
not
tell
me
much
of
his
affairs
'
my
father
she
burst
out
suddenly
is
always
scolding
me
for
my
extravagance
and
he
has
been
doing
it
to
-
day
more
than
ever
he
said
i
go
shopping
in
town
to
simply
a
diabolical
extent
and
exceed
my
allowance
'
was
that
this
evening
'
yes
and
then
it
reached
such
a
storm
of
passion
between
us
that
i
pretended
to
retire
to
my
room
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
but
i
slipped
out
and
i
am
never
going
back
home
again
'
what
will
you
do
'
i
shall
go
first
to
my
aunt
in
london
and
if
she
wo
not
have
me
i
will
work
for
a
living
i
have
left
my
father
for
ever
what
i
should
have
done
if
i
had
not
met
you
i
cannot
tell
i
must
have
walked
all
the
way
to
london
i
suppose
now
i
shall
take
the
train
as
soon
as
i
reach
the
mainland
'
if
you
ever
do
in
this
hurricane
'
i
must
sit
here
till
it
stops
and
there
on
the
nets
they
sat
pierston
knew
of
old
bencomb
as
his
father
'
s
bitterest
enemy
who
had
made
a
great
fortune
by
swallowing
up
the
small
stone
-
merchants
but
had
found
jocelyn
'
s
sire
a
trifle
too
big
to
digest
the
latter
being
in
fact
the
chief
rival
of
the
best
-
bed
company
to
that
day
jocelyn
thought
it
strange
that
he
should
be
thrown
by
fate
into
a
position
to
play
the
son
of
the
montagues
to
this
daughter
of
the
capulets
as
they
talked
there
was
a
mutual
instinct
to
drop
their
voices
and
on
this
account
the
roar
of
the
storm
necessitated
their
drawing
quite
close
together
something
tender
came
into
their
tones
as
quarter
-
hour
after
quarter
-
hour
went
on
and
they
forgot
the
lapse
of
time
it
was
quite
late
when
she
started
up
alarmed
at
her
position
'
rain
or
no
rain
i
can
stay
no
longer
she
said
'
do
come
back
said
he
taking
her
hand
i
will
return
with
you
my
train
has
gone
'
no
i
shall
go
on
and
get
a
lodging
in
budmouth
town
if
ever
i
reach
it
'
it
is
so
late
that
there
will
be
no
house
open
except
a
little
place
near
the
station
where
you
wo
not
care
to
stay
however
if
you
are
determined
i
will
show
you
the
way
i
cannot
leave
you
it
would
be
too
awkward
for
you
to
go
there
alone
she
persisted
and
they
started
through
the
twanging
and
spinning
storm
the
sea
rolled
and
rose
so
high
on
their
left
and
was
so
near
them
on
their
right
that
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
traversing
its
bottom
like
the
children
of
israel
nothing
but
the
frail
bank
of
pebbles
divided
them
from
the
raging
gulf
without
and
at
every
bang
of
the
tide
against
it
the
ground
shook
the
shingle
clashed
the
spray
rose
vertically
and
was
blown
over
their
heads
quantities
of
sea
-
water
trickled
through
the
pebble
wall
and
ran
in
rivulets
across
their
path
to
join
the
sea
within
the
'
island
'
was
an
island
still
they
had
not
realized
the
force
of
the
elements
till
now
pedestrians
had
often
been
blown
into
the
sea
hereabout
and
drowned
owing
to
a
sudden
breach
in
the
bank
which
however
had
something
of
a
supernatural
power
in
being
able
to
close
up
and
join
itself
together
again
after
such
disruption
like
satan
'
s
form
when
cut
in
two
by
the
sword
of
michael
the
ethereal
substance
closed
not
long
divisible
her
clothing
offered
more
resistance
to
the
wind
than
his
and
she
was
consequently
in
the
greater
danger
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
his
proffered
aid
first
he
gave
his
arm
but
the
wind
tore
them
apart
as
easily
as
coupled
cherries
he
steadied
her
bodily
by
encircling
her
waist
with
his
arm
and
she
made
no
objection
somewhere
about
this
time
it
might
have
been
sooner
it
might
have
been
later
he
became
conscious
of
a
sensation
which
in
its
incipient
and
unrecognized
form
had
lurked
within
him
from
some
unnoticed
moment
when
he
was
sitting
close
to
his
new
friend
under
the
lerret
though
a
young
man
he
was
too
old
a
hand
not
to
know
what
this
was
and
felt
alarmed
even
dismayed
it
meant
a
possible
migration
of
the
well
-
beloved
the
thing
had
not
however
taken
place
and
he
went
on
thinking
how
soft
and
warm
the
lady
was
in
her
fur
covering
as
he
held
her
so
tightly
the
only
dry
spots
in
the
clothing
of
either
being
her
left
side
and
his
right
where
they
excluded
the
rain
by
their
mutual
pressure
as
soon
as
they
had
crossed
the
ferry
-
bridge
there
was
a
little
more
shelter
but
he
did
not
relinquish
his
hold
till
she
requested
him
they
passed
the
ruined
castle
and
having
left
the
island
far
behind
them
trod
mile
after
mile
till
they
drew
near
to
the
outskirts
of
the
neighbouring
watering
-
place
into
it
they
plodded
without
pause
crossing
the
harbour
bridge
about
midnight
wet
to
the
skin
he
pitied
her
and
while
he
wondered
at
it
admired
her
determination
the
houses
facing
the
bay
now
sheltered
them
completely
and
they
reached
the
vicinity
of
the
new
railway
terminus
(
which
the
station
was
at
this
date
)
without
difficulty
as
he
had
said
there
was
only
one
house
open
hereabout
a
little
temperance
inn
where
the
people
stayed
up
for
the
arrival
of
the
morning
mail
and
passengers
from
the
channel
boats
their
application
for
admission
led
to
the
withdrawal
of
a
bolt
and
they
stood
within
the
gaslight
of
the
passage
he
could
see
now
that
though
she
was
such
a
fine
figure
quite
as
tall
as
himself
she
was
but
in
the
bloom
of
young
womanhood
her
face
was
certainly
striking
though
rather
by
its
imperiousness
than
its
beauty
and
the
beating
of
the
wind
and
rain
and
spray
had
inflamed
her
cheeks
to
peony
hues
she
persisted
in
the
determination
to
go
on
to
london
by
an
early
morning
train
and
he
therefore
offered
advice
on
lesser
matters
only
in
that
case
he
said
you
must
go
up
to
your
room
and
send
down
your
things
that
they
may
be
dried
by
the
fire
immediately
or
they
will
not
be
ready
i
will
tell
the
servant
to
do
this
and
send
you
up
something
to
eat
she
assented
to
his
proposal
without
however
showing
any
marks
of
gratitude
and
when
she
had
gone
pierston
despatched
her
the
light
supper
promised
by
the
sleepy
girl
who
was
'
night
porter
'
at
this
establishment
he
felt
ravenously
hungry
himself
and
set
about
drying
his
clothes
as
well
as
he
could
and
eating
at
the
same
time
at
first
he
was
in
doubt
what
to
do
but
soon
decided
to
stay
where
he
was
till
the
morrow
by
the
aid
of
some
temporary
wraps
and
some
slippers
from
the
cupboard
he
was
contriving
to
make
himself
comfortable
when
the
maid
-
servant
came
downstairs
with
a
damp
armful
of
woman
'
s
raiment
pierston
withdrew
from
the
fire
the
maid
-
servant
knelt
down
before
the
blaze
and
held
up
with
extended
arms
one
of
the
habiliments
of
the
juno
upstairs
from
which
a
cloud
of
steam
began
to
rise
as
she
knelt
the
girl
nodded
forward
recovered
herself
and
nodded
again
'
you
are
sleepy
my
girl
said
pierston
'
yes
sir
i
have
been
up
a
long
time
when
nobody
comes
i
lie
down
on
the
couch
in
the
other
room
'
then
i
will
relieve
you
of
that
go
and
lie
down
in
the
other
room
just
as
if
we
were
not
here
i
will
dry
the
clothing
and
put
the
articles
here
in
a
heap
which
you
can
take
up
to
the
young
lady
in
the
morning
the
'
night
porter
'
thanked
him
and
left
the
room
and
he
soon
heard
her
snoring
from
the
adjoining
apartment
then
jocelyn
opened
proceedings
overhauling
the
robes
and
extending
them
one
by
one
as
the
steam
went
up
he
fell
into
a
reverie
he
again
became
conscious
of
the
change
which
had
been
initiated
during
the
walk
the
well
-
beloved
was
moving
house
had
gone
over
to
the
wearer
of
this
attire
in
the
course
of
ten
minutes
he
adored
her
and
how
about
little
avice
caro
he
did
not
think
of
her
as
before
he
was
not
sure
that
he
had
ever
seen
the
real
beloved
in
that
friend
of
his
youth
solicitous
as
he
was
for
her
welfare
but
loving
her
or
not
he
perceived
that
the
spirit
emanation
idealism
which
called
itself
his
love
was
flitting
stealthily
from
some
remoter
figure
to
the
near
one
in
the
chamber
overhead
avice
had
not
kept
her
engagement
to
meet
him
in
the
lonely
ruin
fearing
her
own
imaginings
but
he
in
fact
more
than
she
had
been
educated
out
of
the
island
innocence
that
had
upheld
old
manners
and
this
was
the
strange
consequence
of
avice
'
s
misapprehension
miss
bencomb
was
leaving
the
hotel
for
the
railway
which
was
quite
near
at
hand
and
had
only
recently
been
opened
as
if
on
purpose
for
this
event
at
jocelyn
'
s
suggestion
she
wrote
a
message
to
inform
her
father
that
she
had
gone
to
her
aunt
'
s
with
a
view
to
allaying
anxiety
and
deterring
pursuit
they
walked
together
to
the
platform
and
bade
each
other
good
-
bye
each
obtained
a
ticket
independently
and
jocelyn
got
his
luggage
from
the
cloak
-
room
on
the
platform
they
encountered
each
other
again
and
there
was
a
light
in
their
glances
at
each
other
which
said
as
by
a
flash
-
telegraph
we
are
bound
for
the
same
town
why
not
enter
the
same
compartment
they
did
she
took
a
corner
seat
with
her
back
to
the
engine
he
sat
opposite
the
guard
looked
in
thought
they
were
lovers
and
did
not
show
other
travellers
into
that
compartment
they
talked
on
strictly
ordinary
matters
what
she
thought
he
did
not
know
but
at
every
stopping
station
he
dreaded
intrusion
before
they
were
halfway
to
london
the
event
he
had
just
begun
to
realize
was
a
patent
fact
the
beloved
was
again
embodied
she
filled
every
fibre
and
curve
of
this
woman
'
s
form
drawing
near
the
great
london
station
was
like
drawing
near
doomsday
how
should
he
leave
her
in
the
turmoil
of
a
crowded
city
street
she
seemed
quite
unprepared
for
the
rattle
of
the
scene
he
asked
her
where
her
aunt
lived
'
bayswater
said
miss
bencomb
he
called
a
cab
and
proposed
that
she
should
share
it
till
they
arrived
at
her
aunt
'
s
whose
residence
lay
not
much
out
of
the
way
to
his
own
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
ascertain
if
she
understood
his
feelings
but
she
assented
to
his
offer
and
entered
the
vehicle
'
we
are
old
friends
he
said
as
they
drove
onward
'
indeed
we
are
she
answered
without
smiling
'
but
hereditarily
we
are
mortal
enemies
dear
juliet
'
yes
what
did
you
say
'
i
said
juliet
she
laughed
in
a
half
-
proud
way
and
murmured
your
father
is
my
father
'
s
enemy
and
my
father
is
mine
yes
it
is
so
and
then
their
eyes
caught
each
other
'
s

queenly
darling

burst
out
instead
of
going
to
your

will
you
come
and
marry
me
a
flush
covered
her
over
which
seemed
akin
to
a
flush
of
rage
it
was
not
exactly
that
but
she
was
excited
she
did
not
answer
and
he
feared
he
had
mortally
offended
her
dignity
perhaps
she
had
only
made
use
of
him
as
a
convenient
aid
to
her
intentions
however
he
went
on
'
your
father

not

musingly

calmed
down

they
stopped

while
they
held

consultation
pierston
had
rooms
and
a
studio
in
the
neighbourhood
of

hill

it
would
be
hardly
desirable
to
take
her
thither
till
they
were
married
they
decided
to
go
to
an
hotel
changing
their
direction
therefore
they
went
back
to
the
strand
and
soon
ensconced
themselves
in
one
of
the
venerable
old
taverns
of
covent
garden
a
precinct
which
in
those
days
was
frequented
by
west
-
country
people
jocelyn
then
left
her
and
proceeded
on
his
errand
eastward
it
was
about
three
o
'
clock
when
having
arranged
all
preliminaries
necessitated
by
this
sudden
change
of
front
he
began
strolling
slowly
back
he
felt
bewildered
and
to
walk
was
a
relief
gazing
occasionally
into
this
shop
window
and
that
he
called
a
hansom
as
by
an
inspiration
and
directed
the
driver
to
'
mellstock
gardens
arrived
here
he
rang
the
bell
of
a
studio
and
in
a
minute
or
two
it
was
answered
by
a
young
man
in
shirt
-
sleeves
about
his
own
age
with
a
great
smeared
palette
on
his
left
thumb
'
o
you
pierston
i
thought
you
were
in
the
country
come
in
i
am
awfully
glad
of
this
i
am
here
in
town
finishing
off
a
painting
for
an
american
who
wants
to
take
it
back
with
him
pierston
followed
his
friend
into
the
painting
-
room
where
a
pretty
young
woman
was
sitting
sewing
at
a
signal
from
the
painter
she
disappeared
without
speaking
'
i
can
see
from
your
face
you
have
something
to
say
so
we
will
have
it
all
to
ourselves

trouble
what
will
you
drink

oh
it
does
not
matter
what
so
that
it
is
alcohol
in
some
shape

form
now
somers
you
must
just
listen
to
me
for
i
have
something
to
tell
pierston
had
sat
down
in
an
arm

chair
and
somers
had
resumed
his
painting
when
a
servant
had
brought
in
brandy
to
soothe
pierston
'
s
nerves
and
soda
to
take
off
the
injurious
effects
of
the
brandy
and
milk
to
take
off
the
depleting
effects
of
the
soda
jocelyn
began
his
narrative
addressing
it
rather
to
somers
'
s
gothic
chimneypiece
and
somers
'
s
gothic
clock
and
somers
'
s
gothic
rugs
than
to
somers
himself
who
stood
at
his
picture
a
little
behind
his
friend
'
before
i
tell
you
what
has
happened
to
me
pierston
said
i
want
to
let
you
know
the
manner
of
man
i
am
'
lord
i
know
already
'
no
you
do
not
it
is
a
sort
of
thing
one
does
not
like
to
talk
of
i
lie
awake
at
night
thinking
about
it
'
no
said
somers
with
more
sympathy
seeing
that
his
friend
was
really
troubled
'
i
am
under
a
curious
curse
or
influence
i
am
posed
puzzled
and
perplexed
by
the
legerdemain
of
a
creature
a
deity
rather
by
aphrodite
as
a
poet
would
put
it
as
i
should
put
it
myself
in
marble
but
i
forget
this
is
not
to
be
a
deprecatory
wail
but
a
defence
a
sort
of
apologia
pro
vita
mea
'
that
'
s
better
fire
away
'
you
somers
are
not
i
know
one
of
those
who
continue
to
indulge
in
the
world
-
wide
fond
superstition
that
the
beloved
one
of
any
man
always
or
even
usually
cares
to
remain
in
one
corporeal
nook
or
shell
for
any
great
length
of
time
however
much
he
may
wish
her
to
do
so
if
i
am
wrong
and
you
do
still
hold
to
that
ancient
error
well
my
story
will
seem
rather
queer
'
suppose
you
say
the
beloved
of
some
men
not
of
any
man
'
all
right
i
will
say
one
man
this
man
only
if
you
are
so
particular
we
are
a
strange
visionary
race
down
where
i
come
from
and
perhaps
that
accounts
for
it
the
beloved
of
this
one
man
then
has
had
many
incarnations
too
many
to
describe
in
detail
each
shape
or
embodiment
has
been
a
temporary
residence
only
which
she
has
entered
lived
in
awhile
and
made
her
exit
from
leaving
the
substance
so
far
as
i
have
been
concerned
a
corpse
worse
luck
now
there
is
no
spiritualistic
nonsense
in
this
it
is
simple
fact
put
in
the
plain
form
that
the
conventional
public
are
afraid
of
so
much
for
the
principle
'
good
go
on
'
well
the
first
embodiment
of
her
occurred
so
nearly
as
i
can
recollect
when
i
was
about
the
age
of
nine
her
vehicle
was
a
little
blue
-
eyed
girl
of
eight
or
so
one
of
a
family
of
eleven
with
flaxen
hair
about
her
shoulders
which
attempted
to
curl
but
ignominiously
failed
hanging
like
chimney
-
crooks
only
this
defect
used
rather
to
trouble
me
and
was
i
believe
one
of
the
main
reasons
of
my
beloved
'
s
departure
from
that
tenement
i
cannot
remember
with
any
exactness
when
the
departure
occurred
i
know
it
was
after
i
had
kissed
my
little
friend
in
a
garden
-
seat
on
a
hot
noontide
under
a
blue
gingham
umbrella
which
we
had
opened
over
us
as
we
sat
that
passers
through
east
quarriers
might
not
observe
our
marks
of
affection
forgetting
that
our
screen
must
attract
more
attention
than
our
persons
'
when
the
whole
dream
came
to
an
end
through
her
father
leaving
the
island
i
thought
my
well
-
beloved
had
gone
for
ever
(
being
then
in
the
unpractised
condition
of
adam
at
sight
of
the
first
sunset
)
but
she
had
not
laura
had
gone
for
ever
but
not
my
beloved
'
for
some
months
after
i
had
done
crying
for
the
flaxen
-
haired
edition
of
her
my
love
did
not
reappear
then
she
came
suddenly
unexpectedly
in
a
situation
i
should
never
have
predicted
i
was
standing
on
the
kerbstone
of
the
pavement
in
budmouth
-
regis
outside
the
preparatory
school
looking
across
towards
the
sea
when
a
middle
-
aged
gentleman
on
horseback
and
beside
him
a
young
lady
also
mounted
passed
down
the
street
the
girl
turned
her
head
and
possibly
because
i
was
gaping
at
her
in
awkward
admiration
or
smiling
myself
smiled
at
me
having
ridden
a
few
paces
she
looked
round
again
and
smiled
'
it
was
enough
more
than
enough
to
set
me
on
fire
i
understood
in
a
moment
the
information
conveyed
to
me
by
my
emotion
the
well
-
beloved
had
reappeared
this
second
form
in
which
it
had
pleased
her
to
take
up
her
abode
was
quite
a
grown
young
woman
'
s
darker
in
complexion
than
the
first
her
hair
also
worn
in
a
knot
was
of
an
ordinary
brown
and
so
i
think
were
her
eyes
but
the
niceties
of
her
features
were
not
to
be
gathered
so
cursorily
however
there
sat
my
coveted
one
re
-
embodied
and
bidding
my
schoolmates
a
hasty
farewell
as
soon
as
i
could
do
so
without
suspicion
i
hurried
along
the
esplanade
in
the
direction
she
and
her
father
had
ridden
but
they
had
put
their
horses
to
a
canter
and
i
could
not
see
which
way
they
had
gone
in
the
greatest
misery
i
turned
down
a
side
street
but
was
soon
elevated
to
a
state
of
excitement
by
seeing
the
same
pair
galloping
towards
me
flushing
up
to
my
hair
i
stopped
and
heroically
faced
her
as
she
passed
she
smiled
again
but
alas
upon
my
love
'
s
cheek
there
was
no
blush
of
passion
for
me
pierston
paused
and
drank
from
his
glass
as
he
lived
for
a
brief
moment
in
the
scene
he
had
conjured
up
somers
reserved
his
comments
and
jocelyn
continued
'
that
afternoon
i
idled
about
the
streets
looking
for
her
in
vain
when
i
next
saw
one
of
the
boys
who
had
been
with
me
at
her
first
passing
i
stealthily
reminded
him
of
the
incident
and
asked
if
he
knew
the
riders
o
yes
he
said
that
was
colonel
targe
and
his
daughter
elsie
how
old
do
you
think
she
is
said
i
a
sense
of
disparity
in
our
ages
disturbing
my
mind
o
nineteen
i
think
they
say
she
is
going
to
be
married
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
to
captain
popp
of
the
501st
and
they
are
ordered
off
to
india
at
once
'
the
grief
which
i
experienced
at
this
intelligence
was
such
that
at
dusk
i
went
away
to
the
edge
of
the
harbour
intending
to
put
an
end
to
myself
there
and
then
but
i
had
been
told
that
crabs
had
been
found
clinging
to
the
dead
faces
of
persons
who
had
fallen
in
thereabout
leisurely
eating
them
and
the
idea
of
such
an
unpleasant
contingency
deterred
me
i
should
state
that
the
marriage
of
my
beloved
concerned
me
little
it
was
her
departure
that
broke
my
heart
i
never
saw
her
again
'
though
i
had
already
learnt
that
the
absence
of
the
corporeal
matter
did
not
involve
the
absence
of
the
informing
spirit
i
could
scarce
bring
myself
to
believe
that
in
this
case
it
was
possible
for
her
to
return
to
my
view
without
the
form
she
had
last
inhabited
'
but
she
did
'
it
was
not
however
till
after
a
good
space
of
time
during
which
i
passed
through
that
bearish
age
in
boys
their
early
teens
when
girls
are
their
especial
contempt
i
was
about
seventeen
and
was
sitting
one
evening
over
a
cup
of
tea
in
a
confectioner
'
s
at
the
very
same
watering
-
place
when
opposite
me
a
lady
took
her
seat
with
a
little
girl
we
looked
at
each
other
awhile
the
child
made
advances
till
i
said
she
is
a
good
little
thing
'
the
lady
assented
and
made
a
further
remark
she
has
the
soft
fine
eyes
of
her
mother
said
i
do
you
think
her
eyes
are
good
asks
the
lady
as
if
she
had
not
heard
what
she
had
heard
most
the
last
three
words
of
my
opinion
yes
for
copies
said
i
regarding
her
'
after
this
we
got
on
very
well
she
informed
me
that
her
husband
had
gone
out
in
a
yacht
and
i
said
it
was
a
pity
he
did
not
take
her
with
him
for
the
airing
she
gradually
disclosed
herself
in
the
character
of
a
deserted
young
wife
and
later
on
i
met
her
in
the
street
without
the
child
she
was
going
to
the
landing
-
stage
to
meet
her
husband
so
she
told
me
but
she
did
not
know
the
way
'
i
offered
to
show
her
and
did
so
i
will
not
go
into
particulars
but
i
afterwards
saw
her
several
times
and
soon
discovered
that
the
beloved
(
as
to
whose
whereabouts
i
had
been
at
fault
so
long
)
lurked
here
though
why
she
had
chosen
this
tantalizing
situation
of
an
inaccessible
matron
'
s
form
when
so
many
others
offered
it
was
beyond
me
to
discover
the
whole
affair
ended
innocently
enough
when
the
lady
left
the
town
with
her
husband
and
child
she
seemed
to
regard
our
acquaintance
as
a
flirtation
yet
it
was
anything
but
a
flirtation
for
me
'
why
should
i
tell
the
rest
of
the
tantalizing
tale
after
this
the
well
-
beloved
put
herself
in
evidence
with
greater
and
greater
frequency
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
give
you
details
of
her
various
incarnations
she
came
nine
times
in
the
course
of
the
two
or
three
ensuing
years
four
times
she
masqueraded
as
a
brunette
twice
as
a
pale
-
haired
creature
and
two
or
three
times
under
a
complexion
neither
light
nor
dark
sometimes
she
was
a
tall
fine
girl
but
more
often
i
think
she
preferred
to
slip
into
the
skin
of
a
lithe
airy
being
of
no
great
stature
i
grew
so
accustomed
to
these
exits
and
entrances
that
i
resigned
myself
to
them
quite
passively
talked
to
her
kissed
her
corresponded
with
her
ached
for
her
in
each
of
her
several
guises
so
it
went
on
until
a
month
ago
and
then
for
the
first
time
i
was
puzzled
she
either
had
or
she
had
not
entered
the
person
of
avice
caro
a
young
girl
i
had
known
from
infancy
upon
the
whole
i
have
decided
that
after
all
she
did
not
enter
the
form
of
avice
caro
because
i
retain
so
great
a
respect
for
her
still
pierston
here
gave
in
brief
the
history
of
his
revived
comradeship
with
avice
the
verge
of
the
engagement
to
which
they
had
reached
and
its
unexpected
rupture
by
him
merely
through
his
meeting
with
a
woman
into
whom
the
well
-
beloved
unmistakably
moved
under
his
very
eyes
by
name
miss
marcia
bencomb
he
described
their
spontaneous
decision
to
marry
offhand
and
then
he
put
it
to
somers
whether
he
ought
to
marry
or
not
-
-
her
or
anybody
else
in
such
circumstances
'
certainly
not
said
somers
though
if
anybody
little
avice
but
not
even
her
you
are
like
other
men
only
rather
worse
essentially
all
men
are
fickle
like
you
but
not
with
such
perceptiveness
'
surely
fickle
is
not
the
word
fickleness
means
getting
weary
of
a
thing
while
the
thing
remains
the
same
but
i
have
always
been
faithful
to
the
elusive
creature
whom
i
have
never
been
able
to
get
