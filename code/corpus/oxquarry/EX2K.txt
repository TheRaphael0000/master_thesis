dain
was
not
long
in
crossing
the
river
after
leaving
almayer
he
landed
at
the
water
-
gate
of
the
stockade
enclosing
the
group
of
houses
which
composed
the
residence
of
the
rajah
of
sambir
evidently
somebody
was
expected
there
for
the
gate
was
open
and
men
with
torches
were
ready
to
precede
the
visitor
up
the
inclined
plane
of
planks
leading
to
the
largest
house
where
lakamba
actually
resided
and
where
all
the
business
of
state
was
invariably
transacted
the
other
buildings
within
the
enclosure
served
only
to
accommodate
the
numerous
household
and
the
wives
of
the
ruler
lakamba
'
s
own
house
was
a
strong
structure
of
solid
planks
raised
on
high
piles
with
a
verandah
of
split
bamboos
surrounding
it
on
all
sides
the
whole
was
covered
in
by
an
immensely
high
-
pitched
roof
of
palm
-
leaves
resting
on
beams
blackened
by
the
smoke
of
many
torches
the
building
stood
parallel
to
the
river
one
of
its
long
sides
facing
the
water
-
gate
of
the
stockade
there
was
a
door
in
the
short
side
looking
up
the
river
and
the
inclined
plank
-
way
led
straight
from
the
gate
to
that
door
by
the
uncertain
light
of
smoky
torches
dain
noticed
the
vague
outlines
of
a
group
of
armed
men
in
the
dark
shadows
to
his
right
from
that
group
babalatchi
stepped
forward
to
open
the
door
and
dain
entered
the
audience
chamber
of
the
rajah
'
s
residence
about
one
-
third
of
the
house
was
curtained
off
by
heavy
stuff
of
european
manufacture
for
that
purpose
close
to
the
curtain
there
was
a
big
arm
-
chair
of
some
black
wood
much
carved
and
before
it
a
rough
deal
table
otherwise
the
room
was
only
furnished
with
mats
in
great
profusion
to
the
left
of
the
entrance
stood
a
rude
arm
-
rack
with
three
rifles
with
fixed
bayonets
in
it
by
the
wall
in
the
shadow
the
body
-
guard
of
lakamba
all
friends
or
relations
slept
in
a
confused
heap
of
brown
arms
legs
and
multi
-
coloured
garments
from
whence
issued
an
occasional
snore
or
a
subdued
groan
of
some
uneasy
sleeper
an
european
lamp
with
a
green
shade
standing
on
the
table
made
all
this
indistinctly
visible
to
dain
you
are
welcome
to
your
rest
here
said
babalatchi
looking
at
dain
interrogatively
i
must
speak
to
the
rajah
at
once
answered
dain
babalatchi
made
a
gesture
of
assent
and
turning
to
the
brass
gong
suspended
under
the
arm
-
rack
struck
two
sharp
blows
the
ear
-
splitting
din
woke
up
the
guard
the
snores
ceased
outstretched
legs
were
drawn
in
the
whole
heap
moved
and
slowly
resolved
itself
into
individual
forms
with
much
yawning
and
rubbing
of
sleepy
eyes
behind
the
curtains
there
was
a
burst
of
feminine
chatter
then
the
bass
voice
of
lakamba
was
heard
is
that
the
arab
trader
no
tuan
answered
babalatchi
dain
has
returned
at
last
he
is
here
for
an
important
talk
bitcharra
if
you
mercifully
consent
evidently
lakamba
'
s
mercy
went
so
far
for
in
a
short
while
he
came
out
from
behind
the
curtain
but
it
did
not
go
to
the
length
of
inducing
him
to
make
an
extensive
toilet
a
short
red
sarong
tightened
hastily
round
his
hips
was
his
only
garment
the
merciful
ruler
of
sambir
looked
sleepy
and
rather
sulky
he
sat
in
the
arm
-
chair
his
knees
well
apart
his
elbows
on
the
arm
-
rests
his
chin
on
his
breast
breathing
heavily
and
waiting
malevolently
for
dain
to
open
the
important
talk
but
dain
did
not
seem
anxious
to
begin
he
directed
his
gaze
towards
babalatchi
squatting
comfortably
at
the
feet
of
his
master
and
remained
silent
with
a
slightly
bent
head
as
if
in
attentive
expectation
of
coming
words
of
wisdom
babalatchi
coughed
discreetly
and
leaning
forward
pushed
over
a
few
mats
for
dain
to
sit
upon
then
lifting
up
his
squeaky
voice
he
assured
him
with
eager
volubility
of
everybody
'
s
delight
at
this
long
-
looked
-
for
return
his
heart
had
hungered
for
the
sight
of
dain
'
s
face
and
his
ears
were
withering
for
the
want
of
the
refreshing
sound
of
his
voice
everybody
'
s
hearts
and
ears
were
in
the
same
sad
predicament
according
to
babalatchi
as
he
indicated
with
a
sweeping
gesture
the
other
bank
of
the
river
where
the
settlement
slumbered
peacefully
unconscious
of
the
great
joy
awaiting
it
on
the
morrow
when
dain
'
s
presence
amongst
them
would
be
disclosed
for
went
on
babalatchi
what
is
the
joy
of
a
poor
man
if
not
the
open
hand
of
a
generous
trader
or
of
a
great
here
he
checked
himself
abruptly
with
a
calculated
embarrassment
of
manner
and
his
roving
eye
sought
the
floor
while
an
apologetic
smile
dwelt
for
a
moment
on
his
misshapen
lips
once
or
twice
during
this
opening
speech
an
amused
expression
flitted
across
dain
'
s
face
soon
to
give
way
however
to
an
appearance
of
grave
concern
on
lakamba
'
s
brow
a
heavy
frown
had
settled
and
his
lips
moved
angrily
as
he
listened
to
his
prime
minister
'
s
oratory
in
the
silence
that
fell
upon
the
room
when
babalatchi
ceased
speaking
arose
a
chorus
of
varied
snores
from
the
corner
where
the
body
-
guard
had
resumed
their
interrupted
slumbers
but
the
distant
rumble
of
thunder
filling
then
nina
'
s
heart
with
apprehension
for
the
safety
of
her
lover
passed
unheeded
by
those
three
men
intent
each
on
their
own
purposes
for
life
or
death
after
a
short
silence
babalatchi
discarding
now
the
flowers
of
polite
eloquence
spoke
again
but
in
short
and
hurried
sentences
and
in
a
low
voice
they
had
been
very
uneasy
why
did
dain
remain
so
long
absent
the
men
dwelling
on
the
lower
reaches
of
the
river
heard
the
reports
of
big
guns
and
saw
a
fire
-
ship
of
the
dutch
amongst
the
islands
of
the
estuary
so
they
were
anxious
rumours
of
a
disaster
had
reached
abdulla
a
few
days
ago
and
since
then
they
had
been
waiting
for
dain
'
s
return
under
the
apprehension
of
some
misfortune
for
days
they
had
closed
their
eyes
in
fear
and
woke
up
alarmed
and
walked
abroad
trembling
like
men
before
an
enemy
and
all
on
account
of
dain
would
he
not
allay
their
fears
for
his
safety
not
for
themselves
they
were
quiet
and
faithful
and
devoted
to
the
great
rajah
in
batavia
may
his
fate
lead
him
ever
to
victory
for
the
joy
and
profit
of
his
servants
and
here
went
on
babalatchi
lakamba
my
master
was
getting
thin
in
his
anxiety
for
the
trader
he
had
taken
under
his
protection
and
so
was
abdulla
for
what
would
wicked
men
not
say
if
perchance
be
silent
fool
growled
lakamba
angrily
babalatchi
subsided
into
silence
with
a
satisfied
smile
while
dain
who
had
been
watching
him
as
if
fascinated
turned
with
a
sigh
of
relief
towards
the
ruler
of
sambir
lakamba
did
not
move
and
without
raising
his
head
looked
at
dain
from
under
his
eyebrows
breathing
audibly
with
pouted
lips
in
an
air
of
general
discontent
speak
o
dain
he
said
at
last
we
have
heard
many
rumours
many
nights
in
succession
has
my
friend
reshid
come
here
with
bad
tidings
news
travels
fast
along
the
coast
but
they
may
be
untrue
there
are
more
lies
in
men
'
s
mouths
in
these
days
than
when
i
was
young
but
i
am
not
easier
to
deceive
now
all
my
words
are
true
said
dain
carelessly
if
you
want
to
know
what
befell
my
brig
then
learn
that
it
is
in
the
hands
of
the
dutch
believe
me
rajah
he
went
on
with
sudden
energy
the
orang
blanda
have
good
friends
in
sambir
or
else
how
did
they
know
i
was
coming
thence
lakamba
gave
dain
a
short
and
hostile
glance
babalatchi
rose
quietly
and
going
to
the
arm
-
rack
struck
the
gong
violently
outside
the
door
there
was
a
shuffle
of
bare
feet
inside
the
guard
woke
up
and
sat
staring
in
sleepy
surprise
yes
you
faithful
friend
of
the
white
rajah
went
on
dain
scornfully
turning
to
babalatchi
who
had
returned
to
his
place
i
have
escaped
and
i
am
here
to
gladden
your
heart
when
i
saw
the
dutch
ship
i
ran
the
brig
inside
the
reefs
and
put
her
ashore
they
did
not
dare
to
follow
with
the
ship
so
they
sent
the
boats
we
took
to
ours
and
tried
to
get
away
but
the
ship
dropped
fireballs
at
us
and
killed
many
of
my
men
but
i
am
left
o
babalatchi
the
dutch
are
coming
here
they
are
seeking
for
me
they
are
coming
to
ask
their
faithful
friend
lakamba
and
his
slave
babalatchi
rejoice
but
neither
of
his
hearers
appeared
to
be
in
a
joyful
mood
lakamba
had
put
one
leg
over
his
knee
and
went
on
gently
scratching
it
with
a
meditative
air
while
babalatchi
sitting
cross
-
legged
seemed
suddenly
to
become
smaller
and
very
limp
staring
straight
before
him
vacantly
the
guard
evinced
some
interest
in
the
proceedings
stretching
themselves
full
length
on
the
mats
to
be
nearer
the
speaker
one
of
them
got
up
and
now
stood
leaning
against
the
arm
-
rack
playing
absently
with
the
fringes
of
his
sword
-
hilt
dain
waited
till
the
crash
of
thunder
had
died
away
in
distant
mutterings
before
he
spoke
again
are
you
dumb
o
ruler
of
sambir
or
is
the
son
of
a
great
rajah
unworthy
of
your
notice
i
am
come
here
to
seek
refuge
and
to
warn
you
and
want
to
know
what
you
intend
doing
you
came
here
because
of
the
white
man
'
s
daughter
retorted
lakamba
quickly
your
refuge
was
with
your
father
the
rajah
of
bali
the
son
of
heaven
the
'
anak
agong
'
himself
what
am
i
to
protect
great
princes
only
yesterday
i
planted
rice
in
a
burnt
clearing
to
-
day
you
say
i
hold
your
life
in
my
hand
babalatchi
glanced
at
his
master
no
man
can
escape
his
fate
he
murmured
piously
when
love
enters
a
man
'
s
heart
he
is
like
a
child
without
any
understanding
be
merciful
lakamba
he
added
twitching
the
corner
of
the
rajah
'
s
sarong
warningly
lakamba
snatched
away
the
skirt
of
the
sarong
angrily
under
the
dawning
comprehension
of
intolerable
embarrassments
caused
by
dain
'
s
return
to
sambir
he
began
to
lose
such
composure
as
he
had
been
till
then
able
to
maintain
and
now
he
raised
his
voice
loudly
above
the
whistling
of
the
wind
and
the
patter
of
rain
on
the
roof
in
the
hard
squall
passing
over
the
house
you
came
here
first
as
a
trader
with
sweet
words
and
great
promises
asking
me
to
look
the
other
way
while
you
worked
your
will
on
the
white
man
there
and
i
did
what
do
you
want
now
when
i
was
young
i
fought
now
i
am
old
and
want
peace
it
is
easier
for
me
to
have
you
killed
than
to
fight
the
dutch
it
is
better
for
me
the
squall
had
now
passed
and
in
the
short
stillness
of
the
lull
in
the
storm
lakamba
repeated
softly
as
if
to
himself
much
easier
much
better
dain
did
not
seem
greatly
discomposed
by
the
rajah
'
s
threatening
words
while
lakamba
was
speaking
he
had
glanced
once
rapidly
over
his
shoulder
just
to
make
sure
that
there
was
nobody
behind
him
and
tranquillised
in
that
respect
he
had
extracted
a
siri
-
box
out
of
the
folds
of
his
waist
-
cloth
and
was
wrapping
carefully
the
little
bit
of
betel
-
nut
and
a
small
pinch
of
lime
in
the
green
leaf
tendered
him
politely
by
the
watchful
babalatchi
he
accepted
this
as
a
peace
-
offering
from
the
silent
statesman
a
kind
of
mute
protest
against
his
master
'
s
undiplomatic
violence
and
as
an
omen
of
a
possible
understanding
to
be
arrived
at
yet
otherwise
dain
was
not
uneasy
although
recognising
the
justice
of
lakamba
'
s
surmise
that
he
had
come
back
to
sambir
only
for
the
sake
of
the
white
man
'
s
daughter
yet
he
was
not
conscious
of
any
childish
lack
of
understanding
as
suggested
by
babalatchi
in
fact
dain
knew
very
well
that
lakamba
was
too
deeply
implicated
in
the
gunpowder
smuggling
to
care
for
an
investigation
the
dutch
authorities
into
that
matter
when
sent
off
by
his
father
the
independent
rajah
of
bali
at
the
time
when
the
hostilities
between
dutch
and
malays
threatened
to
spread
from
sumatra
over
the
whole
archipelago
dain
had
found
all
the
big
traders
deaf
to
his
guarded
proposals
and
above
the
temptation
of
the
great
prices
he
was
ready
to
give
for
gunpowder
he
went
to
sambir
as
a
last
and
almost
hopeless
resort
having
heard
in
macassar
of
the
white
man
there
and
of
the
regular
steamer
trading
from
singapore
allured
also
by
the
fact
that
there
was
no
dutch
resident
on
the
river
which
would
make
things
easier
no
doubt
his
hopes
got
nearly
wrecked
against
the
stubborn
loyalty
of
lakamba
arising
from
well
-
understood
self
-
interest
but
at
last
the
young
man
'
s
generosity
his
persuasive
enthusiasm
the
prestige
of
his
father
'
s
great
name
overpowered
the
prudent
hesitation
of
the
ruler
of
sambir
lakamba
would
have
nothing
to
do
himself
with
any
illegal
traffic
he
also
objected
to
the
arabs
being
made
use
of
in
that
matter
but
he
suggested
almayer
saying
that
he
was
a
weak
man
easily
persuaded
and
that
his
friend
the
english
captain
of
the
steamer
could
be
made
very
useful
very
likely
even
would
join
in
the
business
smuggling
the
powder
in
the
steamer
without
abdulla
'
s
knowledge
there
again
dain
met
in
almayer
with
unexpected
resistance
lakamba
had
to
send
babalatchi
over
with
the
solemn
promise
that
his
eyes
would
be
shut
in
friendship
for
the
white
man
dain
paying
for
the
promise
and
the
friendship
in
good
silver
guilders
of
the
hated
orang
blanda
almayer
at
last
consenting
said
the
powder
would
be
obtained
but
dain
must
trust
him
with
dollars
to
send
to
singapore
in
payment
for
it
he
would
induce
ford
to
buy
and
smuggle
it
in
the
steamer
on
board
the
brig
he
did
not
want
any
money
for
himself
out
of
the
transaction
but
dain
must
help
him
in
his
great
enterprise
after
sending
off
the
brig
almayer
had
explained
to
dain
that
he
could
not
trust
lakamba
alone
in
that
matter
he
would
be
afraid
of
losing
his
treasure
and
his
life
through
the
cupidity
of
the
rajah
yet
the
rajah
had
to
be
told
and
insisted
on
taking
a
share
in
that
operation
or
else
his
eyes
would
remain
shut
no
longer
to
this
almayer
had
to
submit
had
dain
not
seen
nina
he
would
have
probably
refused
to
engage
himself
and
his
men
in
the
projected
expedition
to
gunong
mas
the
mountain
of
gold
as
it
was
he
intended
to
return
with
half
of
his
men
as
soon
as
the
brig
was
clear
of
the
reefs
but
the
persistent
chase
given
him
by
the
dutch
frigate
had
forced
him
to
run
south
and
ultimately
to
wreck
and
destroy
his
vessel
in
order
to
preserve
his
liberty
or
perhaps
even
his
life
yes
he
had
come
back
to
sambir
for
nina
although
aware
that
the
dutch
would
look
for
him
there
but
he
had
also
calculated
his
chances
of
safety
in
lakamba
'
s
hands
for
all
his
ferocious
talk
the
merciful
ruler
would
not
kill
him
for
he
had
long
ago
been
impressed
with
the
notion
that
dain
possessed
the
secret
of
the
white
man
'
s
treasure
neither
would
he
give
him
up
to
the
dutch
for
fear
of
some
fatal
disclosure
of
complicity
in
the
treasonable
trade
so
dain
felt
tolerably
secure
as
he
sat
meditating
quietly
his
answer
to
the
rajah
'
s
bloodthirsty
speech
yes
he
would
point
out
to
him
the
aspect
of
his
position
should
he
dain
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
dutch
and
should
he
speak
the
truth
he
would
have
nothing
more
to
lose
then
and
he
would
speak
the
truth
and
if
he
did
return
to
sambir
disturbing
thereby
lakamba
'
s
peace
of
mind
what
then
he
came
to
look
after
his
property
did
he
not
pour
a
stream
of
silver
into
mrs
almayer
'
s
greedy
lap
he
had
paid
for
the
girl
a
price
worthy
of
a
great
prince
although
unworthy
of
that
delightfully
maddening
creature
for
whom
his
untamed
soul
longed
in
an
intensity
of
desire
far
more
tormenting
than
the
sharpest
pain
he
wanted
his
happiness
he
had
the
right
to
be
in
sambir
he
rose
and
approaching
the
table
leaned
both
his
elbows
on
it
lakamba
responsively
edged
his
seat
a
little
closer
while
babalatchi
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
thrust
his
inquisitive
head
between
his
master
'
s
and
dain
'
s
they
interchanged
their
ideas
rapidly
speaking
in
whispers
into
each
other
'
s
faces
very
close
now
dain
suggesting
lakamba
contradicting
babalatchi
conciliating
and
anxious
in
his
vivid
apprehension
of
coming
difficulties
he
spoke
most
whispering
earnestly
turning
his
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
so
as
to
bring
his
solitary
eye
to
bear
upon
each
of
his
interlocutors
in
turn
why
should
there
be
strife
said
he
let
tuan
dain
whom
he
loved
only
less
than
his
master
go
trustfully
into
hiding
there
were
many
places
for
that
bulangi
'
s
house
away
in
the
clearing
was
best
bulangi
was
a
safe
man
in
the
network
of
crooked
channels
no
white
man
could
find
his
way
white
men
were
strong
but
very
foolish
it
was
undesirable
to
fight
them
but
deception
was
easy
they
were
like
silly
women
they
did
not
know
the
use
of
reason
and
he
was
a
match
for
any
of
them
went
on
babalatchi
with
all
the
confidence
of
deficient
experience
probably
the
dutch
would
seek
almayer
maybe
they
would
take
away
their
countryman
if
they
were
suspicious
of
him
that
would
be
good
after
the
dutch
went
away
lakamba
and
dain
would
get
the
treasure
without
any
trouble
and
there
would
be
one
person
less
to
share
it
did
he
not
speak
wisdom
will
tuan
dain
go
to
bulangi
'
s
house
till
the
danger
is
over
go
at
once
dain
accepted
this
suggestion
of
going
into
hiding
with
a
certain
sense
of
conferring
a
favour
upon
lakamba
and
the
anxious
statesman
but
he
met
the
proposal
of
going
at
once
with
a
decided
no
looking
babalatchi
meaningly
in
the
eye
the
statesman
sighed
as
a
man
accepting
the
inevitable
would
do
and
pointed
silently
towards
the
other
bank
of
the
river
dain
bent
his
head
slowly
yes
i
am
going
there
he
said
before
the
day
comes
asked
babalatchi
i
am
going
there
now
answered
dain
decisively
the
orang
blanda
will
not
be
here
before
to
-
morrow
night
perhaps
and
i
must
tell
almayer
of
our
arrangements
no
tuan
no
say
nothing
protested
babalatchi
i
will
go
over
myself
at
sunrise
and
let
him
know
i
will
see
said
dain
preparing
to
go
the
thunderstorm
was
recommencing
outside
the
heavy
clouds
hanging
low
overhead
now
there
was
a
constant
rumble
of
distant
thunder
punctuated
by
the
nearer
sharp
crashes
and
in
the
continuous
play
of
blue
lightning
the
woods
and
the
river
showed
fitfully
with
all
the
elusive
distinctness
of
detail
characteristic
of
such
a
scene
outside
the
door
of
the
rajah
'
s
house
dain
and
babalatchi
stood
on
the
shaking
verandah
as
if
dazed
and
stunned
by
the
violence
of
the
storm
they
stood
there
amongst
the
cowering
forms
of
the
rajah
'
s
slaves
and
retainers
seeking
shelter
from
the
rain
and
dain
called
aloud
to
his
boatmen
who
responded
with
an
unanimous
ada
tuan
while
they
looked
uneasily
at
the
river
this
is
a
great
flood
shouted
babalatchi
into
dain
'
s
ear
the
river
is
very
angry
look
look
at
the
drifting
logs
can
you
go
dain
glanced
doubtfully
on
the
livid
expanse
of
seething
water
bounded
far
away
on
the
other
side
by
the
narrow
black
line
of
the
forests
suddenly
in
a
vivid
white
flash
the
low
point
of
land
with
the
bending
trees
on
it
and
almayer
'
s
house
leaped
into
view
flickered
and
disappeared
dain
pushed
babalatchi
aside
and
ran
down
to
the
water
-
gate
followed
by
his
shivering
boatmen
babalatchi
backed
slowly
in
and
closed
the
door
then
turned
round
and
looked
silently
upon
lakamba
the
rajah
sat
still
glaring
stonily
upon
the
table
and
babalatchi
gazed
curiously
at
the
perplexed
mood
of
the
man
he
had
served
so
many
years
through
good
and
evil
fortune
no
doubt
the
one
-
eyed
statesman
felt
within
his
savage
and
much
sophisticated
breast
the
unwonted
feelings
of
sympathy
with
and
perhaps
even
pity
for
the
man
he
called
his
master
from
the
safe
position
of
a
confidential
adviser
he
could
in
the
dim
vista
of
past
years
see
himself
a
casual
cut
-
throat
finding
shelter
under
that
man
'
s
roof
in
the
modest
rice
-
clearing
of
early
beginnings
then
came
a
long
period
of
unbroken
success
of
wise
counsels
and
deep
plottings
resolutely
carried
out
by
the
fearless
lakamba
till
the
whole
east
coast
from
poulo
laut
to
tanjong
batu
listened
to
babalatchi
'
s
wisdom
speaking
through
the
mouth
of
the
ruler
of
sambir
in
those
long
years
how
many
dangers
escaped
how
many
enemies
bravely
faced
how
many
white
men
successfully
circumvented
and
now
he
looked
upon
the
result
of
so
many
years
of
patient
toil
the
fearless
lakamba
cowed
by
the
shadow
of
an
impending
trouble
the
ruler
was
growing
old
and
babalatchi
aware
of
an
uneasy
feeling
at
the
pit
of
his
stomach
put
both
his
hands
there
with
a
suddenly
vivid
and
sad
perception
of
the
fact
that
he
himself
was
growing
old
too
that
the
time
of
reckless
daring
was
past
for
both
of
them
and
that
they
had
to
seek
refuge
in
prudent
cunning
they
wanted
peace
they
were
disposed
to
reform
they
were
ready
even
to
retrench
so
as
to
have
the
wherewithal
to
bribe
the
evil
days
away
if
bribed
away
they
could
be
babalatchi
sighed
for
the
second
time
that
night
as
he
squatted
again
at
his
master
'
s
feet
and
tendered
him
his
betel
-
nut
box
in
mute
sympathy
and
they
sat
there
in
close
yet
silent
communion
of
betel
-
nut
chewers
moving
their
jaws
slowly
expectorating
decorously
into
the
wide
-
mouthed
brass
vessel
they
passed
to
one
another
and
listening
to
the
awful
din
of
the
battling
elements
outside
there
is
a
very
great
flood
remarked
babalatchi
sadly
yes
said
lakamba
did
dain
go
he
went
tuan
he
ran
down
to
the
river
like
a
man
possessed
of
the
sheitan
himself
there
was
another
long
pause
he
may
get
drowned
suggested
lakamba
at
last
with
some
show
of
interest
the
floating
logs
are
many
answered
babalatchi
but
he
is
a
good
swimmer
he
added
languidly
he
ought
to
live
said
lakamba
he
knows
where
the
treasure
is
babalatchi
assented
with
an
ill
-
humoured
grunt
his
want
of
success
in
penetrating
the
white
man
'
s
secret
as
to
the
locality
where
the
gold
was
to
be
found
was
a
sore
point
with
the
statesman
of
sambir
as
the
only
conspicuous
failure
in
an
otherwise
brilliant
career
a
great
peace
had
now
succeeded
the
turmoil
of
the
storm
only
the
little
belated
clouds
which
hurried
past
overhead
to
catch
up
the
main
body
flashing
silently
in
the
distance
sent
down
short
showers
that
pattered
softly
with
a
soothing
hiss
over
the
palm
-
leaf
roof
lakamba
roused
himself
from
his
apathy
with
an
appearance
of
having
grasped
the
situation
at
last
babalatchi
he
called
briskly
giving
him
a
slight
kick
ada
tuan
i
am
listening
if
the
orang
blanda
come
here
babalatchi
and
take
almayer
to
batavia
to
punish
him
for
smuggling
gunpowder
what
will
he
do
you
think
i
do
not
know
tuan
you
are
a
fool
commented
lakamba
exultingly
he
will
tell
them
where
the
treasure
is
so
as
to
find
mercy
he
will
babalatchi
looked
up
at
his
master
and
nodded
his
head
with
by
no
means
a
joyful
surprise
he
had
not
thought
of
this
there
was
a
new
complication
almayer
must
die
said
lakamba
decisively
to
make
our
secret
safe
he
must
die
quietly
babalatchi
you
must
do
it
babalatchi
assented
and
rose
wearily
to
his
feet
to
-
morrow
he
asked
yes
before
the
dutch
come
he
drinks
much
coffee
answered
lakamba
with
seeming
irrelevancy
babalatchi
stretched
himself
yawning
but
lakamba
in
the
flattering
consciousness
of
a
knotty
problem
solved
by
his
own
unaided
intellectual
efforts
grew
suddenly
very
wakeful
babalatchi
he
said
to
the
exhausted
statesman
fetch
the
box
of
music
the
white
captain
gave
me
i
cannot
sleep
at
this
order
a
deep
shade
of
melancholy
settled
upon
babalatchi
'
s
features
he
went
reluctantly
behind
the
curtain
and
soon
reappeared
carrying
in
his
arms
a
small
hand
-
organ
which
he
put
down
on
the
table
with
an
air
of
deep
dejection
lakamba
settled
himself
comfortably
in
his
arm
-
chair
turn
babalatchi
turn
he
murmured
with
closed
eyes
babalatchi
'
s
hand
grasped
the
handle
with
the
energy
of
despair
and
as
he
turned
the
deep
gloom
on
his
countenance
changed
into
an
expression
of
hopeless
resignation
through
the
open
shutter
the
notes
of
verdi
'
s
music
floated
out
on
the
great
silence
over
the
river
and
forest
lakamba
listened
with
closed
eyes
and
a
delighted
smile
babalatchi
turned
at
times
dozing
off
and
swaying
over
then
catching
himself
up
in
a
great
fright
with
a
few
quick
turns
of
the
handle
nature
slept
in
an
exhausted
repose
after
the
fierce
turmoil
while
under
the
unsteady
hand
of
the
statesman
of
sambir
the
trovatore
fitfully
wept
wailed
and
bade
good
-
bye
to
his
leonore
again
and
again
in
a
mournful
round
of
tearful
and
endless
iteration
the
bright
sunshine
of
the
clear
mistless
morning
after
the
stormy
night
flooded
the
main
path
of
the
settlement
leading
from
the
low
shore
of
the
pantai
branch
of
the
river
to
the
gate
of
abdulla
'
s
compound
the
path
was
deserted
this
morning
it
stretched
its
dark
yellow
surface
hard
beaten
by
the
tramp
of
many
bare
feet
between
the
clusters
of
palm
trees
whose
tall
trunks
barred
it
with
strong
black
lines
at
irregular
intervals
while
the
newly
risen
sun
threw
the
shadows
of
their
leafy
heads
far
away
over
the
roofs
of
the
buildings
lining
the
river
even
over
the
river
itself
as
it
flowed
swiftly
and
silently
past
the
deserted
houses
for
the
houses
were
deserted
too
on
the
narrow
strip
of
trodden
grass
intervening
between
their
open
doors
and
the
road
the
morning
fires
smouldered
untended
sending
thin
fluted
columns
of
smoke
into
the
cool
air
and
spreading
the
thinnest
veil
of
mysterious
blue
haze
over
the
sunlit
solitude
of
the
settlement
almayer
just
out
of
his
hammock
gazed
sleepily
at
the
unwonted
appearance
of
sambir
wondering
vaguely
at
the
absence
of
life
his
own
house
was
very
quiet
he
could
not
hear
his
wife
'
s
voice
nor
the
sound
of
nina
'
s
footsteps
in
the
big
room
opening
on
the
verandah
which
he
called
his
sitting
-
room
whenever
in
the
company
of
white
men
he
wished
to
assert
his
claims
to
the
commonplace
decencies
of
civilisation
nobody
ever
sat
there
there
was
nothing
there
to
sit
upon
for
mrs
almayer
in
her
savage
moods
when
excited
by
the
reminiscences
of
the
piratical
period
of
her
life
had
torn
off
the
curtains
to
make
sarongs
for
the
slave
-
girls
and
had
burnt
the
showy
furniture
piecemeal
to
cook
the
family
rice
but
almayer
was
not
thinking
of
his
furniture
now
he
was
thinking
of
dain
'
s
return
of
dain
'
s
nocturnal
interview
with
lakamba
of
its
possible
influence
on
his
long
-
matured
plans
now
nearing
the
period
of
their
execution
he
was
also
uneasy
at
the
non
-
appearance
of
dain
who
had
promised
him
an
early
visit
the
fellow
had
plenty
of
time
to
cross
the
river
he
mused
and
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
to
-
day
the
settling
of
details
for
the
early
start
on
the
morrow
the
launching
of
the
boats
the
thousand
and
one
finishing
touches
for
the
expedition
must
start
complete
nothing
should
be
forgotten
nothing
should
the
sense
of
the
unwonted
solitude
grew
upon
him
suddenly
and
in
the
unusual
silence
he
caught
himself
longing
even
for
the
usually
unwelcome
sound
of
his
wife
'
s
voice
to
break
the
oppressive
stillness
which
seemed
to
his
frightened
fancy
to
portend
the
advent
of
some
new
misfortune
what
has
happened
he
muttered
half
aloud
as
he
shuffled
in
his
imperfectly
adjusted
slippers
towards
the
balustrade
of
the
verandah
is
everybody
asleep
or
dead
the
settlement
was
alive
and
very
much
awake
it
was
awake
ever
since
the
early
break
of
day
when
mahmat
banjer
in
a
fit
of
unheard
-
of
energy
arose
and
taking
up
his
hatchet
stepped
over
the
sleeping
forms
of
his
two
wives
and
walked
shivering
to
the
water
'
s
edge
to
make
sure
that
the
new
house
he
was
building
had
not
floated
away
during
the
night
the
house
was
being
built
by
the
enterprising
mahmat
on
a
large
raft
and
he
had
securely
moored
it
just
inside
the
muddy
point
of
land
at
the
junction
of
the
two
branches
of
the
pantai
so
as
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
drifting
logs
that
would
no
doubt
strand
on
the
point
during
the
freshet
mahmat
walked
through
the
wet
grass
saying
bourrouh
and
cursing
softly
to
himself
the
hard
necessities
of
active
life
that
drove
him
from
his
warm
couch
into
the
cold
of
the
morning
a
glance
showed
him
that
his
house
was
still
there
and
he
congratulated
himself
on
his
foresight
in
hauling
it
out
of
harm
'
s
way
for
the
increasing
light
showed
him
a
confused
wrack
of
drift
-
logs
half
-
stranded
on
the
muddy
flat
interlocked
into
a
shapeless
raft
by
their
branches
tossing
to
and
fro
and
grinding
together
in
the
eddy
caused
by
the
meeting
currents
of
the
two
branches
of
the
river
mahmat
walked
down
to
the
water
'
s
edge
to
examine
the
rattan
moorings
of
his
house
just
as
the
sun
cleared
the
trees
of
the
forest
on
the
opposite
shore
as
he
bent
over
the
fastenings
he
glanced
again
carelessly
at
the
unquiet
jumble
of
logs
and
saw
there
something
that
caused
him
to
drop
his
hatchet
and
stand
up
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
from
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
it
was
something
red
and
the
logs
rolled
over
it
at
times
closing
round
it
sometimes
hiding
it
it
looked
to
him
at
first
like
a
strip
of
red
cloth
the
next
moment
mahmat
had
made
it
out
and
raised
a
great
shout
ah
ya
there
yelled
mahmat
there
'
s
a
man
amongst
the
logs
he
put
the
palms
of
his
hand
to
his
lips
and
shouted
enunciating
distinctly
his
face
turned
towards
the
settlement
there
'
s
a
body
of
a
man
in
the
river
come
and
see
a
dead
stranger
the
women
of
the
nearest
house
were
already
outside
kindling
the
fires
and
husking
the
morning
rice
they
took
up
the
cry
shrilly
and
it
travelled
so
from
house
to
house
dying
away
in
the
distance
the
men
rushed
out
excited
but
silent
and
ran
towards
the
muddy
point
where
the
unconscious
logs
tossed
and
ground
and
bumped
and
rolled
over
the
dead
stranger
with
the
stupid
persistency
of
inanimate
things
the
women
followed
neglecting
their
domestic
duties
and
disregarding
the
possibilities
of
domestic
discontent
while
groups
of
children
brought
up
the
rear
warbling
joyously
in
the
delight
of
unexpected
excitement
almayer
called
aloud
for
his
wife
and
daughter
but
receiving
no
response
stood
listening
intently
the
murmur
of
the
crowd
reached
him
faintly
bringing
with
it
the
assurance
of
some
unusual
event
he
glanced
at
the
river
just
as
he
was
going
to
leave
the
verandah
and
checked
himself
at
the
sight
of
a
small
canoe
crossing
over
from
the
rajah
'
s
landing
-
place
the
solitary
occupant
(
in
whom
almayer
soon
recognised
babalatchi
)
effected
the
crossing
a
little
below
the
house
and
paddled
up
to
the
lingard
jetty
in
the
dead
water
under
the
bank
babalatchi
clambered
out
slowly
and
went
on
fastening
his
canoe
with
fastidious
care
as
if
not
in
a
hurry
to
meet
almayer
whom
he
saw
looking
at
him
from
the
verandah
this
delay
gave
almayer
time
to
notice
and
greatly
wonder
at
babalatchi
'
s
official
get
-
up
the
statesman
of
sambir
was
clad
in
a
costume
befitting
his
high
rank
a
loudly
checkered
sarong
encircled
his
waist
and
from
its
many
folds
peeped
out
the
silver
hilt
of
the
kriss
that
saw
the
light
only
on
great
festivals
or
during
official
receptions
over
the
left
shoulder
and
across
the
otherwise
unclad
breast
of
the
aged
diplomatist
glistened
a
patent
leather
belt
bearing
a
brass
plate
with
the
arms
of
netherlands
under
the
inscription
sultan
of
sambir
babalatchi
'
s
head
was
covered
by
a
red
turban
whose
fringed
ends
falling
over
the
left
cheek
and
shoulder
gave
to
his
aged
face
a
ludicrous
expression
of
joyous
recklessness
when
the
canoe
was
at
last
fastened
to
his
satisfaction
he
straightened
himself
up
shaking
down
the
folds
of
his
sarong
and
moved
with
long
strides
towards
almayer
'
s
house
swinging
regularly
his
long
ebony
staff
whose
gold
head
ornamented
with
precious
stones
flashed
in
the
morning
sun
almayer
waved
his
hand
to
the
right
towards
the
point
of
land
to
him
invisible
but
in
full
view
from
the
jetty
oh
babalatchi
oh
he
called
out
what
is
the
matter
there
can
you
see
babalatchi
stopped
and
gazed
intently
at
the
crowd
on
the
river
bank
and
after
a
little
while
the
astonished
almayer
saw
him
leave
the
path
gather
up
his
sarong
in
one
hand
and
break
into
a
trot
through
the
grass
towards
the
muddy
point
almayer
now
greatly
interested
ran
down
the
steps
of
the
verandah
the
murmur
of
men
'
s
voices
and
the
shrill
cries
of
women
reached
him
quite
distinctly
now
and
as
soon
as
he
turned
the
corner
of
his
house
he
could
see
the
crowd
on
the
low
promontory
swaying
and
pushing
round
some
object
of
interest
he
could
indistinctly
hear
babalatchi
'
s
voice
then
the
crowd
opened
before
the
aged
statesman
and
closed
after
him
with
an
excited
hum
ending
in
a
loud
shout
as
almayer
approached
the
throng
a
man
ran
out
and
rushed
past
him
towards
the
settlement
unheeding
his
call
to
stop
and
explain
the
cause
of
this
excitement
on
the
very
outskirts
of
the
crowd
almayer
found
himself
arrested
by
an
unyielding
mass
of
humanity
regardless
of
his
entreaties
for
a
passage
insensible
to
his
gentle
pushes
as
he
tried
to
work
his
way
through
it
towards
the
riverside
in
the
midst
of
his
gentle
and
slow
progress
he
fancied
suddenly
he
had
heard
his
wife
'
s
voice
in
the
thickest
of
the
throng
he
could
not
mistake
very
well
mrs
almayer
'
s
high
-
pitched
tones
yet
the
words
were
too
indistinct
for
him
to
understand
their
purport
he
paused
in
his
endeavours
to
make
a
passage
for
himself
intending
to
get
some
intelligence
from
those
around
him
when
a
long
and
piercing
shriek
rent
the
air
silencing
the
murmurs
of
the
crowd
and
the
voices
of
his
informants
for
a
moment
almayer
remained
as
if
turned
into
stone
with
astonishment
and
horror
for
he
was
certain
now
that
he
had
heard
his
wife
wailing
for
the
dead
he
remembered
nina
'
s
unusual
absence
and
maddened
by
his
apprehensions
as
to
her
safety
he
pushed
blindly
and
violently
forward
the
crowd
falling
back
with
cries
of
surprise
and
pain
before
his
frantic
advance
on
the
point
of
land
in
a
little
clear
space
lay
the
body
of
the
stranger
just
hauled
out
from
amongst
the
logs
on
one
side
stood
babalatchi
his
chin
resting
on
the
head
of
his
staff
and
his
one
eye
gazing
steadily
at
the
shapeless
mass
of
broken
limbs
torn
flesh
and
bloodstained
rags
as
almayer
burst
through
the
ring
of
horrified
spectators
mrs
almayer
threw
her
own
head
-
veil
over
the
upturned
face
of
the
drowned
man
and
squatting
by
it
with
another
mournful
howl
sent
a
shiver
through
the
now
silent
crowd
mahmat
dripping
wet
turned
to
almayer
eager
to
tell
his
tale
in
the
first
moment
of
reaction
from
the
anguish
of
his
fear
the
sunshine
seemed
to
waver
before
almayer
'
s
eyes
and
he
listened
to
words
spoken
around
him
without
comprehending
their
meaning
when
by
a
strong
effort
of
will
he
regained
the
possession
of
his
senses
mahmat
was
saying
that
is
the
way
tuan
his
sarong
was
caught
in
the
broken
branch
and
he
hung
with
his
head
under
water
when
i
saw
what
it
was
i
did
not
want
it
here
i
wanted
it
to
get
clear
and
drift
away
why
should
we
bury
a
stranger
in
the
midst
of
our
houses
for
his
ghost
to
frighten
our
women
and
children
have
we
not
enough
ghosts
about
this
place
a
murmur
of
approval
interrupted
him
here
mahmat
looked
reproachfully
at
babalatchi
but
the
tuan
babalatchi
ordered
me
to
drag
the
body
ashore
he
went
on
looking
round
at
his
audience
but
addressing
himself
only
to
almayer
and
i
dragged
him
by
the
feet
in
through
the
mud
i
have
dragged
him
although
my
heart
longed
to
see
him
float
down
the
river
to
strand
perchance
on
bulangi
'
s
clearing
may
his
father
'
s
grave
be
defiled
there
was
subdued
laughter
at
this
for
the
enmity
of
mahmat
and
bulangi
was
a
matter
of
common
notoriety
and
of
undying
interest
to
the
inhabitants
of
sambir
in
the
midst
of
that
mirth
mrs
almayer
wailed
suddenly
again
allah
what
ails
the
woman
exclaimed
mahmat
angrily
here
i
have
touched
this
carcass
which
came
from
nobody
knows
where
and
have
most
likely
defiled
myself
before
eating
rice
by
orders
of
tuan
babalatchi
i
did
this
thing
to
please
the
white
man
are
you
pleased
o
tuan
almayer
and
what
will
be
my
recompense
tuan
babalatchi
said
a
recompense
there
will
be
and
from
you
now
consider
i
have
been
defiled
and
if
not
defiled
i
may
be
under
the
spell
look
at
his
anklets
who
ever
heard
of
a
corpse
appearing
during
the
night
amongst
the
logs
with
gold
anklets
on
its
legs
there
is
witchcraft
there
however
added
mahmat
after
a
reflective
pause
i
will
have
the
anklet
if
there
is
permission
for
i
have
a
charm
against
the
ghosts
and
am
not
afraid
god
is
great
a
fresh
outburst
of
noisy
grief
from
mrs
almayer
checked
the
flow
of
mahmat
'
s
eloquence
almayer
bewildered
looked
in
turn
at
his
wife
at
mahmat
at
babalatchi
and
at
last
arrested
his
fascinated
gaze
on
the
body
lying
on
the
mud
with
covered
face
in
a
grotesquely
unnatural
contortion
of
mangled
and
broken
limbs
one
twisted
and
lacerated
arm
with
white
bones
protruding
in
many
places
through
the
torn
flesh
stretched
out
the
hand
with
outspread
fingers
nearly
touching
his
foot
do
you
know
who
this
is
he
asked
of
babalatchi
in
a
low
voice
babalatchi
staring
straight
before
him
hardly
moved
his
lips
while
mrs
almayer
'
s
persistent
lamentations
drowned
the
whisper
of
his
murmured
reply
intended
only
for
almayer
'
s
ear
it
was
fate
look
at
your
feet
white
man
i
can
see
a
ring
on
those
torn
fingers
which
i
know
well
saying
this
babalatchi
stepped
carelessly
forward
putting
his
foot
as
if
accidentally
on
the
hand
of
the
corpse
and
pressing
it
into
the
soft
mud
he
swung
his
staff
menacingly
towards
the
crowd
which
fell
back
a
little
go
away
he
said
sternly
and
send
your
women
to
their
cooking
fires
which
they
ought
not
to
have
left
to
run
after
a
dead
stranger
this
is
men
'
s
work
here
i
take
him
now
in
the
name
of
the
rajah
let
no
man
remain
here
but
tuan
almayer
'
s
slaves
now
go
the
crowd
reluctantly
began
to
disperse
the
women
went
first
dragging
away
the
children
that
hung
back
with
all
their
weight
on
the
maternal
hand
the
men
strolled
slowly
after
them
in
ever
forming
and
changing
groups
that
gradually
dissolved
as
they
neared
the
settlement
and
every
man
regained
his
own
house
with
steps
quickened
by
the
hungry
anticipation
of
the
morning
rice
only
on
the
slight
elevation
where
the
land
sloped
down
towards
the
muddy
point
a
few
men
either
friends
or
enemies
of
mahmat
remained
gazing
curiously
for
some
time
longer
at
the
small
group
standing
around
the
body
on
the
river
bank
i
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
babalatchi
said
almayer
what
is
the
ring
you
are
talking
about
whoever
he
is
you
have
trodden
the
poor
fellow
'
s
hand
right
into
the
mud
uncover
his
face
he
went
on
addressing
mrs
almayer
who
squatting
by
the
head
of
the
corpse
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
shaking
from
time
to
time
her
dishevelled
grey
locks
and
muttering
mournfully
hai
'
exclaimed
mahmat
who
had
lingered
close
by
look
tuan
the
logs
came
together
so
and
here
he
pressed
the
palms
of
his
hands
together
and
his
head
must
have
been
between
them
and
now
there
is
no
face
for
you
to
look
at
there
are
his
flesh
and
his
bones
the
nose
and
the
lips
and
maybe
his
eyes
but
nobody
could
tell
the
one
from
the
other
it
was
written
the
day
he
was
born
that
no
man
could
look
at
him
in
death
and
be
able
to
say
'
this
is
my
friend
'
s
face
'
silence
mahmat
enough
said
babalatchi
and
take
thy
eyes
off
his
anklet
thou
eater
of
pigs
flesh
tuan
almayer
he
went
on
lowering
his
voice
have
you
seen
dain
this
morning
almayer
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
looked
alarmed
no
he
said
quickly
have
not
you
seen
him
is
he
not
with
the
rajah
i
am
waiting
why
does
he
not
come
babalatchi
nodded
his
head
sadly
he
is
come
tuan
he
left
last
night
when
the
storm
was
great
and
the
river
spoke
angrily
the
night
was
very
black
but
he
had
within
him
a
light
that
showed
the
way
to
your
house
as
smooth
as
a
narrow
backwater
and
the
many
logs
no
bigger
than
wisps
of
dried
grass
therefore
he
went
and
now
he
lies
here
and
babalatchi
nodded
his
head
towards
the
body
how
can
you
tell
said
almayer
excitedly
pushing
his
wife
aside
he
snatched
the
cover
off
and
looked
at
the
formless
mass
of
flesh
hair
and
drying
mud
where
the
face
of
the
drowned
man
should
have
been
nobody
can
tell
he
added
turning
away
with
a
shudder
babalatchi
was
on
his
knees
wiping
the
mud
from
the
stiffened
fingers
of
the
outstretched
hand
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
flashed
before
almayer
'
s
eyes
a
gold
ring
set
with
a
large
green
stone
you
know
this
well
he
said
this
never
left
dain
'
s
hand
i
had
to
tear
the
flesh
now
to
get
it
off
do
you
believe
now
almayer
raised
his
hands
to
his
head
and
let
them
fall
listlessly
by
his
side
in
the
utter
abandonment
of
despair
babalatchi
looking
at
him
curiously
was
astonished
to
see
him
smile
a
strange
fancy
had
taken
possession
of
almayer
'
s
brain
distracted
by
this
new
misfortune
it
seemed
to
him
that
for
many
years
he
had
been
falling
into
a
deep
precipice
day
after
day
month
after
month
year
after
year
he
had
been
falling
falling
falling
it
was
a
smooth
round
black
thing
and
the
black
walls
had
been
rushing
upwards
with
wearisome
rapidity
a
great
rush
the
noise
of
which
he
fancied
he
could
hear
yet
and
now
with
an
awful
shock
he
had
reached
the
bottom
and
behold
he
was
alive
and
whole
and
dain
was
dead
with
all
his
bones
broken
it
struck
him
as
funny
a
dead
malay
he
had
seen
many
dead
malays
without
any
emotion
and
now
he
felt
inclined
to
weep
but
it
was
over
the
fate
of
a
white
man
he
knew
a
man
that
fell
over
a
deep
precipice
and
did
not
die
he
seemed
somehow
to
himself
to
be
standing
on
one
side
a
little
way
off
looking
at
a
certain
almayer
who
was
in
great
trouble
poor
poor
fellow
why
does
not
he
cut
his
throat
he
wished
to
encourage
him
he
was
very
anxious
to
see
him
lying
dead
over
that
other
corpse
why
does
he
not
die
and
end
this
suffering
he
groaned
aloud
unconsciously
and
started
with
affright
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
was
he
going
mad
terrified
by
the
thought
he
turned
away
and
ran
towards
his
house
repeating
to
himself
i
am
not
going
mad
of
course
not
no
no
no
he
tried
to
keep
a
firm
hold
of
the
idea
not
mad
not
mad
he
stumbled
as
he
ran
blindly
up
the
steps
repeating
fast
and
ever
faster
those
words
wherein
seemed
to
lie
his
salvation
he
saw
nina
standing
there
and
wished
to
say
something
to
her
but
could
not
remember
what
in
his
extreme
anxiety
not
to
forget
that
he
was
not
going
mad
which
he
still
kept
repeating
mentally
as
he
ran
round
the
table
till
he
stumbled
against
one
of
the
arm
-
chairs
and
dropped
into
it
exhausted
he
sat
staring
wildly
at
nina
still
assuring
himself
mentally
of
his
own
sanity
and
wondering
why
the
girl
shrank
from
him
in
open
-
eyed
alarm
what
was
the
matter
with
her
this
was
foolish
he
struck
the
table
violently
with
his
clenched
fist
and
shouted
hoarsely
give
me
some
gin
run
then
while
nina
ran
off
he
remained
in
the
chair
very
still
and
quiet
astonished
at
the
noise
he
had
made
nina
returned
with
a
tumbler
half
filled
with
gin
and
found
her
father
staring
absently
before
him
almayer
felt
very
tired
now
as
if
he
had
come
from
a
long
journey
he
felt
as
if
he
had
walked
miles
and
miles
that
morning
and
now
wanted
to
rest
very
much
he
took
the
tumbler
with
a
shaking
hand
and
as
he
drank
his
teeth
chattered
against
the
glass
which
he
drained
and
set
down
heavily
on
the
table
he
turned
his
eyes
slowly
towards
nina
standing
beside
him
and
said
steadily
now
all
is
over
nina
he
is
dead
and
i
may
as
well
burn
all
my
boats
he
felt
very
proud
of
being
able
to
speak
so
calmly
decidedly
he
was
not
going
mad
this
certitude
was
very
comforting
and
he
went
on
talking
about
the
finding
of
the
body
listening
to
his
own
voice
complacently
nina
stood
quietly
her
hand
resting
lightly
on
her
father
'
s
shoulder
her
face
unmoved
but
every
line
of
her
features
the
attitude
of
her
whole
body
expressing
the
most
keen
and
anxious
attention
and
so
dain
is
dead
she
said
coldly
when
her
father
ceased
speaking
almayer
'
s
elaborately
calm
demeanour
gave
way
in
a
moment
to
an
outburst
of
violent
indignation
you
stand
there
as
if
you
were
only
half
alive
and
talk
to
me
he
exclaimed
angrily
as
if
it
was
a
matter
of
no
importance
yes
he
is
dead
do
you
understand
dead
what
do
you
care

cared

and
work
and
strive

and
my
suffering

could
never
see

have
no
heart
and
you
have
no
mind
or

would
have
understood
that

was
for
you
for
your
happiness
i
was
working
i
wanted
to
be
rich
i
wanted
to
get
away
from
here
i
wanted
to
see
white
men
bowing
low
before
the
power
of
your
beauty
and
your
wealth
old
as
i
am
i
wished
to
seek
a
strange
land
a
civilisation
to
which
i
am
a
stranger
so
as
to
find
a
new
life
in
the
contemplation
of
your
high
fortunes
of
your
triumphs
of
your
happiness
for
that
i
bore
patiently
the
burden
of
work
of
disappointment
of
humiliation
amongst
these
savages
here
and
i
had
it
all
nearly
in
my
grasp
he
looked
at
his
daughter
'
s
attentive
face
and
jumped
to
his
feet
upsetting
the
chair
do
you
hear
i
had
it
all
there
so
within
reach
of
my
hand
he
paused
trying
to
keep
down
his
rising
anger
and
failed
have
you
no
feeling
he
went
on
have
you
lived
without
hope
nina
'
s
silence
exasperated
him
his
voice
rose
although
he
tried
to
master
his
feelings
are
you
content
to
live
in
this
misery
and
die
in
this
wretched
hole
say
something
nina
have
you
no
sympathy
have
you
no
word
of
comfort
for
me
i
that
loved
you
so
he
waited
for
a
while
for
an
answer
and
receiving
none
shook
his
fist
in
his
daughter
'
s
face
i
believe
you
are
an
idiot
he
yelled
he
looked
round
for
the
chair
picked
it
up
and
sat
down
stiffly
his
anger
was
dead
within
him
and
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
outburst
yet
relieved
to
think
that
now
he
had
laid
clear
before
his
daughter
the
inner
meaning
of
his
life
he
thought
so
in
perfect
good
faith
deceived
by
the
emotional
estimate
of
his
motives
unable
to
see
the
crookedness
of
his
ways
the
unreality
of
his
aims
the
futility
of
his
regrets
and
now
his
heart
was
filled
only
with
a
great
tenderness
and
love
for
his
daughter
he
wanted
to
see
her
miserable
and
to
share
with
her
his
despair
but
he
wanted
it
only
as
all
weak
natures
long
for
a
companionship
in
misfortune
with
beings
innocent
of
its
cause
if
she
suffered
herself
she
would
understand
and
pity
him
but
now
she
would
not
or
could
not
find
one
word
of
comfort
or
love
for
him
in
his
dire
extremity
the
sense
of
his
absolute
loneliness
came
home
to
his
heart
with
a
force
that
made
him
shudder
he
swayed
and
fell
forward
with
his
face
on
the
table
his
arms
stretched
straight
out
extended
and
rigid
nina
made
a
quick
movement
towards
her
father
and
stood
looking
at
the
grey
head
on
the
broad
shoulders
shaken
convulsively
by
the
violence
of
feelings
that
found
relief
at
last
in
sobs
and
tears
nina
sighed
deeply
and
moved
away
from
the
table
her
features
lost
the
appearance
of
stony
indifference
that
had
exasperated
her
father
into
his
outburst
of
anger
and
sorrow
the
expression
of
her
face
now
unseen
by
her
father
underwent
a
rapid
change
she
had
listened
to
almayer
'
s
appeal
for
sympathy
for
one
word
of
comfort
apparently
indifferent
yet
with
her
breast
torn
by
conflicting
impulses
raised
unexpectedly
by
events
she
had
not
foreseen
or
at
least
did
not
expect
to
happen
so
soon
with
her
heart
deeply
moved
by
the
sight
of
almayer
'
s
misery
knowing
it
in
her
power
to
end
it
with
a
word
longing
to
bring
peace
to
that
troubled
heart
she
heard
with
terror
the
voice
of
her
overpowering
love
commanding
her
to
be
silent
and
she
submitted
after
a
short
and
fierce
struggle
of
her
old
self
against
the
new
principle
of
her
life
she
wrapped
herself
up
in
absolute
silence
the
only
safeguard
against
some
fatal
admission
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
make
a
sign
to
murmur
a
word
for
fear
of
saying
too
much
and
the
very
violence
of
the
feelings
that
stirred
the
innermost
recesses
of
her
soul
seemed
to
turn
her
person
into
a
stone
the
dilated
nostrils
and
the
flashing
eyes
were
the
only
signs
of
the
storm
raging
within
and
those
signs
of
his
daughter
'
s
emotion
almayer
did
not
see
for
his
sight
was
dimmed
by
self
-
pity
by
anger
and
by
despair
had
almayer
looked
at
his
daughter
as
she
leant
over
the
front
rail
of
the
verandah
he
could
have
seen
the
expression
of
indifference
give
way
to
a
look
of
pain
and
that
again
pass
away
leaving
the
glorious
beauty
of
her
face
marred
by
deep
-
drawn
lines
of
watchful
anxiety
the
long
grass
in
the
neglected
courtyard
stood
very
straight
before
her
eyes
in
the
noonday
heat
from
the
river
-
bank
there
were
voices
and
a
shuffle
of
bare
feet
approaching
the
house
babalatchi
could
be
heard
giving
directions
to
almayer
'
s
men
and
mrs
almayer
'
s
subdued
wailing
became
audible
as
the
small
procession
bearing
the
body
of
the
drowned
man
and
headed
by
that
sorrowful
matron
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
babalatchi
had
taken
the
broken
anklet
off
the
man
'
s
leg
and
now
held
it
in
his
hand
as
he
moved
by
the
side
of
the
bearers
while
mahmat
lingered
behind
timidly
in
the
hopes
of
the
promised
reward
lay
him
there
said
babalatchi
to
almayer
'
s
men
pointing
to
a
pile
of
drying
planks
in
front
of
the
verandah
lay
him
there
he
was
a
kaffir
and
the
son
of
a
dog
and
he
was
the
white
man
'
s
friend
he
drank
the
white
man
'
s
strong
water
he
added
with
affected
horror
that
i
have
seen
myself
the
men
stretched
out
the
broken
limbs
on
two
planks
they
had
laid
level
while
mrs
almayer
covered
the
body
with
a
piece
of
white
cotton
cloth
and
after
whispering
for
some
time
with
babalatchi
departed
to
her
domestic
duties
almayer
'
s
men
after
laying
down
their
burden
dispersed
themselves
in
quest
of
shady
spots
wherein
to
idle
the
day
away
babalatchi
was
left
alone
by
the
corpse
that
laid
rigid
under
the
white
cloth
in
the
bright
sunshine
nina
came
down
the
steps
and
joined
babalatchi
who
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
squatted
down
with
great
deference
you
have
a
bangle
there
said
nina
looking
down
on
babalatchi
'
s
upturned
face
and
into
his
solitary
eye
i
have
mem
putih
returned
the
polite
statesman
then
turning
towards
mahmat
he
beckoned
him
closer
calling
out
come
here
mahmat
approached
with
some
hesitation
he
avoided
looking
at
nina
but
fixed
his
eyes
on
babalatchi
now
listen
said
babalatchi
sharply
the
ring
and
the
anklet
you
have
seen
and
you
know
they
belonged
to
dain
the
trader
and
to
no
other
dain
returned
last
night
in
a
canoe
he
spoke
with
the
rajah
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
left
to
cross
over
to
the
white
man
'
s
house
there
was
a
great
flood
and
this
morning
you
found
him
in
the
river
by
his
feet
i
dragged
him
out
muttered
mahmat
under
his
breath
tuan
babalatchi
there
will
be
a
recompense
he
exclaimed
aloud
babalatchi
held
up
the
gold
bangle
before
mahmat
'

eyes
what
i
have
told
you
mahmat
is
for
all

what
i
give

mahmat
took
the
bangle
eagerly
and
hid
it
in
the
folds
of
his
waist
-
cloth
am
i
a
fool
to
show
this
thing
in
a
house
with
three
women
in
it
he
growled
but
i
shall
tell
them
about
dain
the
trader
and
there
will
be
talk
enough
he
turned
and
went
away
increasing
his
pace
as
soon
as
he
was
outside
almayer
'
s
compound
babalatchi
looked
after
him
till
he
disappeared
behind
the
bushes
have
i
done
well
mem
putih
he
asked
humbly
addressing
nina
you
have
answered
nina
the
ring
you
may
keep
yourself
babalatchi
touched
his
lips
and
forehead
and
scrambled
to
his
feet
he
looked
at
nina
as
if
expecting
her
to
say
something
more
but
nina
turned
towards
the
house
and
went
up
the
steps
motioning
him
away
with
her
hand
babalatchi
picked
up
his
staff
and
prepared
to
go
it
was
very
warm
and
he
did
not
care
for
the
long
pull
to
the
rajah
'
s
house
yet
he
must
go
and
tell
the
rajah
tell
of
the
event
of
the
change
in
his
plans
of
all
his
suspicions
he
walked
to
the
jetty
and
began
casting
off
the
rattan
painter
of
his
canoe
the
broad
expanse
of
the
lower
reach
with
its
shimmering
surface
dotted
by
the
black
specks
of
the
fishing
canoes
lay
before
his
eyes
the
fishermen
seemed
to
be
racing
babalatchi
paused
in
his
work
and
looked
on
with
sudden
interest
the
man
in
the
foremost
canoe
now
within
hail
of
the
first
houses
of
sambir
laid
in
his
paddle
and
stood
up
shouting
the
boats
the
boats
the
man
-
of
-
war
'
s
boats
are
coming
they
are
here
in
a
moment
the
settlement
was
again
alive
with
people
rushing
to
the
riverside
the
men
began
to
unfasten
their
boats
the
women
stood
in
groups
looking
towards
the
bend
down
the
river
above
the
trees
lining
the
reach
a
slight
puff
of
smoke
appeared
like
a
black
stain
on
the
brilliant
blue
of
the
cloudless
sky
babalatchi
stood
perplexed
the
painter
in
his
hand
he
looked
down
the
reach
then
up
towards
almayer
'
s
house
and
back
again
at
the
river
as
if
undecided
what
to
do
at
last
he
made
the
canoe
fast
again
hastily
and
ran
towards
the
house
and
up
the
steps
of
the
verandah
tuan
tuan
he
called
eagerly
the
boats
are
coming
the
man
-
of
-
war
'
s
boats
you
had
better
get
ready
the
officers
will
come
here
i
know
almayer
lifted
his
head
slowly
from
the
table
and
looked
at
him
stupidly
mem
putih
exclaimed
babalatchi
to
nina
look
at
him
he
does
not
hear
you
must
take
care
he
added
meaningly
nina
nodded
to
him
with
an
uncertain
smile
and
was
going
to
speak
when
a
sharp
report
from
the
gun
mounted
in
the
bow
of
the
steam
launch
that
was
just
then
coming
into
view
arrested
the
words
on
her
parted
lips
the
smile
died
out
and
was
replaced
by
the
old
look
of
anxious
attention
from
the
hills
far
away
the
echo
came
back
like
a
long
-
drawn
and
mournful
sigh
as
if
the
land
had
sent
it
in
answer
to
the
voice
of
its
masters
the
news
as
to
the
identity
of
the
body
lying
now
in
almayer
'
s
compound
spread
rapidly
over
the
settlement
during
the
forenoon
most
of
the
inhabitants
remained
in
the
long
street
discussing
the
mysterious
return
and
the
unexpected
death
of
the
man
who
had
become
known
to
them
as
the
trader
his
arrival
during
the
north
-
east
monsoon
his
long
sojourn
in
their
midst
his
sudden
departure
with
his
brig
and
above
all
the
mysterious
appearance
of
the
body
said
to
be
his
amongst
the
logs
were
subjects
to
wonder
at
and
to
talk
over
and
over
again
with
undiminished
interest
mahmat
moved
from
house
to
house
and
from
group
to
group
always
ready
to
repeat
his
tale
how
he
saw
the
body
caught
by
the
sarong
in
a
forked
log
how
mrs
almayer
coming
one
of
the
first
at
his
cries
recognised
it
even
before
he
had
it
hauled
on
shore
how
babalatchi
ordered
him
to
bring
it
out
of
the
water
by
the
feet
i
dragged
him
in
and
there
was
no
head
exclaimed
mahmat
and
how
could
the
white
man
'
s
wife
know
who
it
was
she
was
a
witch
it
was
well
known
and
did
you
see
how
the
white
man
himself
ran
away
at
the
sight
of
the
body
like
a
deer
he
ran
and
here
mahmat
imitated
almayer
'
s
long
strides
to
the
great
joy
of
the
beholders
and
for
all
his
trouble
he
had
nothing
the
ring
with
the
green
stone
tuan
babalatchi
kept
nothing
nothing
he
spat
down
at
his
feet
in
sign
of
disgust
and
left
that
group
to
seek
further
on
a
fresh
audience
the
news
spreading
to
the
furthermost
parts
of
the
settlement
found
out
abdulla
in
the
cool
recess
of
his
godown
where
he
sat
overlooking
his
arab
clerks
and
the
men
loading
and
unloading
the
up
-
country
canoes
reshid
who
was
busy
on
the
jetty
was
summoned
into
his
uncle
'
s
presence
and
found
him
as
usual
very
calm
and
even
cheerful
but
very
much
surprised
the
rumour
of
the
capture
or
destruction
of
dain
'
s
brig
had
reached
the
arab
'
s
ears
three
days
before
from
the
sea
-
fishermen
and
through
the
dwellers
on
the
lower
reaches
of
the
river
it
had
been
passed
up
-
stream
from
neighbour
to
neighbour
till
bulangi
whose
clearing
was
nearest
to
the
settlement
had
brought
that
news
himself
to
abdulla
whose
favour
he
courted
but
rumour
also
spoke
of
a
fight
and
of
dain
'
s
death
on
board
his
own
vessel
and
now
all
the
settlement
talked
of
dain
'
s
visit
to
the
rajah
and
of
his
death
when
crossing
the
river
in
the
dark
to
see
almayer
they
could
not
understand
this
reshid
thought
that
it
was
very
strange
he
felt
uneasy
and
doubtful
but
abdulla
after
the
first
shock
of
surprise
with
the
old
age
'
s
dislike
for
solving
riddles
showed
a
becoming
resignation
he
remarked
that
the
man
was
dead
now
at
all
events
and
consequently
no
more
dangerous
where
was
the
use
to
wonder
at
the
decrees
of
fate
especially
if
they
were
propitious
to
the
true
believers
and
with
a
pious
ejaculation
to
allah
the
merciful
the
compassionate
abdulla
seemed
to
regard
the
incident
as
closed
for
the
present
not
so
reshid
he
lingered
by
his
uncle
pulling
thoughtfully
his
neatly
trimmed
beard
there
are
many
lies
he
murmured
he
has
been
dead
once
before
and
came
to
life
to
die
again
now
the
dutch
will
be
here
before
many
days
