an
apology
is
perhaps
needed
for
the
neglect
of
contrast
which
is
shown
by
presenting
two
consecutive
stories
of
hangmen
in
such
a
small
collection
as
the
following
but
in
the
neighbourhood
of
county
-
towns
tales
of
executions
used
to
form
a
large
proportion
of
the
local
traditions
and
though
never
personally
acquainted
with
any
chief
operator
at
such
scenes
the
writer
of
these
pages
had
as
a
boy
the
privilege
of
being
on
speaking
terms
with
a
man
who
applied
for
the
office
and
who
sank
into
an
incurable
melancholy
because
he
failed
to
get
it
some
slight
mitigation
of
his
grief
being
to
dwell
upon
striking
episodes
in
the
lives
of
those
happier
ones
who
had
held
it
with
success
and
renown
his
tale
of
disappointment
used
to
cause
some
wonder
why
his
ambition
should
have
taken
such
an
unfortunate
form
but
its
nobleness
was
never
questioned
in
those
days
too
there
was
still
living
an
old
woman
who
for
the
cure
of
some
eating
disease
had
been
taken
in
her
youth
to
have
her
'
blood
turned
'
by
a
convict
'
s
corpse
in
the
manner
described
in
'
the
withered
arm
'
since
writing
this
story
some
years
ago
i
have
been
reminded
by
an
aged
friend
who
knew
'
rhoda
brook
'
that
in
relating
her
dream
my
forgetfulness
has
weakened
the
facts
our
of
which
the
tale
grew
in
reality
it
was
while
lying
down
on
a
hot
afternoon
that
the
incubus
oppressed
her
and
she
flung
it
off
with
the
results
upon
the
body
of
the
original
as
described
to
my
mind
the
occurrence
of
such
a
vision
in
the
daytime
is
more
impressive
than
if
it
had
happened
in
a
midnight
dream
readers
are
therefore
asked
to
correct
the
misrelation
which
affords
an
instance
of
how
our
imperfect
memories
insensibly
formalize
the
fresh
originality
of
living
fact
from
whose
shape
they
slowly
depart
as
machine
-
made
castings
depart
by
degrees
from
the
sharp
hand
-
work
of
the
mould
among
the
many
devices
for
concealing
smuggled
goods
in
caves
and
pits
of
the
earth
that
of
planting
an
apple
-
tree
in
a
tray
or
box
which
was
placed
over
the
mouth
of
the
pit
is
i
believe
unique
and
it
is
detailed
in
one
of
the
tales
precisely
as
described
by
an
old
carrier
of
'
tubs
'
a
man
who
was
afterwards
in
my
father
'
s
employ
for
over
thirty
years
i
never
gathered
from
his
reminiscences
what
means
were
adopted
for
lifting
the
tree
which
with
its
roots
earth
and
receptacle
must
have
been
of
considerable
weight
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
the
thing
was
done
through
many
years
my
informant
often
spoke
too
of
the
horribly
suffocating
sensation
produced
by
the
pair
of
spirit
-
tubs
slung
upon
the
chest
and
back
after
stumbling
with
the
burden
of
them
for
several
miles
inland
over
a
rough
country
and
in
darkness
he
said
that
though
years
of
his
youth
and
young
manhood
were
spent
in
this
irregular
business
his
profits
from
the
same
taken
all
together
did
not
average
the
wages
he
might
have
earned
in
a
steady
employment
whilst
the
fatigues
and
risks
were
excessive
i
may
add
that
the
first
story
in
the
series
turns
upon
a
physical
possibility
that
may
attach
to
women
of
imaginative
temperament
and
that
is
well
supported
by
the
experiences
of
medical
men
and
other
observers
of
such
manifestations
when
william
marchmill
had
finished
his
inquiries
for
lodgings
at
a
well
-
known
watering
-
place
in
upper
wessex
he
returned
to
the
hotel
to
find
his
wife
she
with
the
children
had
rambled
along
the
shore
and
marchmill
followed
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
military
-
looking
hall
-
porter
by
jove
how
far
you
'
ve
gone
i
am
quite
out
of
breath
marchmill
said
rather
impatiently
when
he
came
up
with
his
wife
who
was
reading
as
she
walked
the
three
children
being
considerably
further
ahead
with
the
nurse
mrs
marchmill
started
out
of
the
reverie
into
which
the
book
had
thrown
her
yes
she
said
you
'
ve
been
such
a
long
time
i
was
tired
of
staying
in
that
dreary
hotel
but
i
am
sorry
if
you
have
wanted
me
will
'
well
i
have
had
trouble
to
suit
myself
when
you
see
the
airy
and
comfortable
rooms
heard
of
you
find
they
are
stuffy
and
uncomfortable
will
you
come
and
see
if
what
i
'
ve
fixed
on
will
do
there
is
not
much
room
i
am
afraid
hut
i
can
light
on
nothing
better
the
town
is
rather
full
'
the
pair
left
the
children
and
nurse
to
continue
their
ramble
and
went
back
together
in
age
well
-
balanced
in
personal
appearance
fairly
matched
and
in
domestic
requirements
conformable
in
temper
this
couple
differed
though
even
here
they
did
not
often
clash
he
being
equable
if
not
lymphatic
and
she
decidedly
nervous
and
sanguine
it
was
to
their
tastes
and
fancies
those
smallest
greatest
particulars
that
no
common
denominator
could
be
applied
marchmill
considered
his
wife
'
s
likes
and
inclinations
somewhat
silly
she
considered
his
sordid
and
material
the
husband
'
s
business
was
that
of
a
gunmaker
in
a
thriving
city
northwards
and
his
soul
was
in
that
business
always
the
lady
was
best
characterized
by
that
superannuated
phrase
of
elegance
a
votary
of
the
muse
'
an
impressionable
palpitating
creature
was
ella
shrinking
humanely
from
detailed
knowledge
of
her
husband
'
s
trade
whenever
she
reflected
that
everything
he
manufactured
had
for
its
purpose
the
destruction
of
life
she
could
only
recover
her
equanimity
by
assuring
herself
that
some
at
least
of
his
weapons
were
sooner
or
later
used
for
the
extermination
of
horrid
vermin
and
animals
almost
as
cruel
to
their
inferiors
in
species
as
human
beings
were
to
theirs
she
had
never
antecedently
regarded
this
occupation
of
his
as
any
objection
to
having
him
for
a
husband
indeed
the
necessity
of
getting
life
-
leased
at
all
cost
a
cardinal
virtue
which
all
good
mothers
teach
kept
her
from
thinking
of
it
at
all
till
she
had
closed
with
william
had
passed
the
honeymoon
and
reached
the
reflecting
stage
then
like
a
person
who
has
stumbled
upon
some
object
in
the
dark
she
wondered
what
she
had
got
mentally
walked
round
it
estimated
it
whether
it
were
rare
or
common
contained
gold
silver
or
lead
were
a
clog
or
a
pedestal
everything
to
her
or
nothing
she
came
to
some
vague
conclusions
and
since
then
had
kept
her
heart
alive
by
pitying
her
proprietor
'
s
obtuseness
and
want
of
refinement
pitying
herself
and
letting
off
her
delicate
and
ethereal
emotions
in
imaginative
occupations
day
-
dreams
and
night
-
sighs
which
perhaps
would
not
much
have
disturbed
william
if
he
had
known
of
them
her
figure
was
small
elegant
and
slight
in
build
tripping
or
rather
bounding
in
movement
she
was
dark
-
eyed
and
had
that
marvellously
bright
and
liquid
sparkle
in
each
pupil
which
characterizes
persons
of
ella
'
s
cast
of
soul
and
is
too
often
a
cause
of
heartache
to
the
possessor
'
s
male
friends
ultimately
sometimes
to
herself
her
husband
was
a
tall
long
-
featured
man
with
a
brown
beard
he
had
a
pondering
regard
and
was
it
must
be
added
usually
kind
and
tolerant
to
her
he
spoke
in
squarely
shaped
sentences
and
was
supremely
satisfied
with
a
condition
of
sublunary
things
which
made
weapons
a
necessity
husband
and
wife
walked
till
they
had
reached
the
house
they
were
in
search
of
which
stood
in
a
terrace
facing
the
sea
and
was
fronted
by
a
small
garden
of
wind
-
proof
and
salt
-
proof
evergreens
stone
steps
leading
up
to
the
porch
it
had
its
number
in
the
row
but
being
rather
larger
than
the
rest
was
in
addition
sedulously
distinguished
as
coburg
house
by
its
landlady
though
everybody
else
called
it
thirteen
new
parade
'
the
spot
was
bright
and
lively
now
but
in
winter
it
became
necessary
to
place
sandbags
against
the
door
and
to
stuff
up
the
keyhole
against
the
wind
and
rain
which
had
worn
the
paint
so
thin
that
the
priming
and
knotting
showed
through
the
householder
who
bad
been
watching
for
the
gentleman
'
s
return
met
them
in
the
passage
and
showed
the
rooms
she
informed
them
that
she
was
a
professional
man
'
s
widow
left
in
needy
circumstances
by
the
rather
sudden
death
of
her
husband
and
she
spoke
anxiously
of
the
conveniences
of
the
establishment
mrs
marchmill
said
that
she
liked
the
situation
and
the
house
but
it
being
small
there
would
not
be
accommodation
enough
unless
she
could
have
all
the
rooms
the
landlady
mused
with
an
air
of
disappointment
she
wanted
the
visitors
to
be
her
tenants
very
badly
she
said
with
obvious
honesty
but
unfortunately
two
of
the
rooms
were
occupied
permanently
by
a
bachelor
gentleman
he
did
not
pay
season
prices
it
was
true
but
as
he
kept
on
his
apartments
all
the
year
round
and
was
an
extremely
nice
and
interesting
young
man
who
gave
no
trouble
she
did
not
like
to
turn
him
out
for
a
month
'
s
let
even
at
a
high
figure
perhaps
however
she
added
he
might
offer
to
go
for
a
time
they
would
not
hear
of
this
and
went
back
to
the
hotel
intending
to
proceed
to
the
agent
'
s
to
inquire
further
hardly
had
they
sat
down
to
tea
when
the
landlady
called
her
gentleman
she
said
had
been
so
obliging
as
to
offer
to
give
up
his
rooms
for
three
or
four
weeks
rather
than
drive
the
new
-
comers
away
'
it
is
very
kind
but
we
wo
not
inconvenience
him
in
that
way
said
the
marchmills
'
o
it
wo
not
inconvenience
him
i
assure
you
said
the
landlady
eloquently
you
see
he
is
a
different
sort
of
young
man
from
most
-
-
dreamy
solitary
rather
melancholy
and
he
cares
more
to
be
here
when
the
south
-
westerly
gales
are
beating
against
the
door
and
the
sea
washes
over
the
parade
and
there
'
s
not
a
soul
in
the
place
than
he
does
now
in
the
season
he
'
d
just
as
soon
be
where
in
fact
he
is
going
temporarily
to
a
little
cottage
on
the
island
opposite
for
a
change
she
hoped
therefore
that
they
would
come
the
marchmill
family
accordingly
took
possession
of
the
house
next
day
and
it
seemed
to
suit
them
very
well
after
luncheon
mr
marchmill
strolled
out
towards
the
pier
and
mrs
marchmill
having
despatched
the
children
to
their
outdoor
amusements
on
the
sands
settled
herself
in
more
completely
examining
this
and
that
article
and
testing
the
reflecting
powers
of
the
mirror
in
the
wardrobe
door
in
the
small
back
sitting
-
room
which
had
been
the
young
bachelor
'
s
she
found
furniture
of
a
more
personal
nature
than
in
the
rest
shabby
books
of
correct
rather
than
rare
editions
were
piled
up
in
a
queerly
reserved
manner
in
corners
as
if
the
previous
occupant
had
not
conceived
the
possibility
that
any
incoming
person
of
the
season
'
s
bringing
could
care
to
look
inside
them
the
landlady
hovered
on
the
threshold
to
rectify
anything
that
mrs
marchmill
might
not
find
to
her
satisfaction
'
i
will
make
this
my
own
little
room
said
the
latter
because
the
books
are
here
by
the
way
the
person
who
has
left
seems
to
have
a
good
many
he
wo
not
mind
my
reading
some
of
them
mrs
hooper
i
hope
'
o
dear
no
ma
'
am
yes
he
has
a
good
many
you
see
he
is
in
the
literary
line
himself
somewhat
he
is
a
poet
yes
really
a
poet
and
he
has
a
little
income
of
his
own
which
is
enough
to
write
verses
on
but
not
enough
for
cutting
a
figure
even
if
he
cared
to
'
a
poet
o
i
did
not
know
that
mrs
marchmill
opened
one
of
the
books
and
saw
the
owner
'
s
name
written
on
the
title
-
page
dear
me
she
continued
i
know
his
name
very
well
robert
trewe
of
course
i
do
and
his
writings
and
it
is
his
rooms
we
have
taken
and
him
we
have
turned
out
of
his
home
ella
marchmill
sitting
down
alone
a
few
minutes
later
thought
with
interested
surprise
of
robert
trewe
her
own
latter
history
will
best
explain
that
interest
herself
the
only
daughter
of
a
struggling
man
of
letters
she
had
during
the
last
year
or
two
taken
to
writing
poems
in
an
endeavour
to
find
a
congenial
channel
in
which
to
let
flow
her
painfully
embayed
emotions
whose
former
limpidity
and
sparkle
seemed
departing
in
the
stagnation
caused
by
the
routine
of
a
practical
household
and
the
gloom
of
bearing
children
to
a
commonplace
father
these
poems
subscribed
with
a
masculine
pseudonym
had
appeared
in
various
obscure
magazines
and
in
two
cases
in
rather
prominent
ones
in
the
second
of
the
latter
the
page
which
bore
her
effusion
at
the
bottom
in
smallish
print
bore
at
the
top
in
large
print
a
few
verses
on
the
same
subject
by
this
very
man
robert
trewe
both
of
them
had
in
fact
been
struck
by
a
tragic
incident
reported
in
the
daily
papers
and
had
used
it
simultaneously
as
an
inspiration
the
editor
remarking
in
a
note
upon
the
coincidence
and
that
the
excellence
of
both
poems
prompted
him
to
give
them
together
after
that
event
ella
otherwise
john
ivy
had
watched
with
much
attention
the
appearance
anywhere
in
print
of
verse
bearing
the
signature
of
robert
trewe
who
with
a
man
'
s
unsusceptibility
on
the
question
of
sex
had
never
once
thought
of
passing
himself
off
as
a
woman
to
be
sure
mrs
marchmill
had
satisfied
herself
with
a
sort
of
reason
for
doing
the
contrary
in
her
case
that
nobody
might
believe
in
her
inspiration
if
they
found
that
the
sentiments
came
from
a
pushing
tradesman
'
s
wife
from
the
mother
of
three
children
by
a
matter
-
of
-
fact
small
-
arms
manufacturer
trewe
'
s
verse
contrasted
with
that
of
the
rank
and
file
of
recent
minor
poets
in
being
impassioned
rather
than
ingenious
luxuriant
rather
than
finished
neither
symboliste
nor
decadent
he
was
a
pessimist
in
so
far
as
that
character
applies
to
a
man
who
looks
at
the
worst
contingencies
as
well
as
the
best
in
the
human
condition
being
little
attracted
by
excellences
of
form
and
rhythm
apart
from
content
he
sometimes
when
feeling
outran
his
artistic
speed
perpetrated
sonnets
in
the
loosely
rhymed
elizabethan
fashion
which
every
right
-
minded
reviewer
said
he
ought
not
to
have
done
with
sad
and
hopeless
envy
ella
marchmill
had
often
and
often
scanned
the
rival
poet
'
s
work
so
much
stronger
as
it
always
was
than
her
own
feeble
lines
she
had
imitated
him
and
her
inability
to
touch
his
level
would
send
her
into
fits
of
despondency
months
passed
away
thus
till
she
observed
from
the
publishers
'
list
that
trewe
had
collected
his
fugitive
pieces
into
a
volume
which
was
duly
issued
and
was
much
or
little
praised
according
to
chance
and
had
a
sale
quite
sufficient
to
pay
for
the
printing
this
step
onward
had
suggested
to
john
ivy
the
idea
of
collecting
her
pieces
also
or
at
any
rate
of
making
up
a
book
of
her
rhymes
by
adding
many
in
manuscript
to
the
few
that
had
seen
the
light
for
she
had
been
able
to
get
no
great
number
into
print
a
ruinous
charge
was
made
for
costs
of
publication
a
few
reviews
noticed
her
poor
little
volume
but
nobody
talked
of
it
nobody
bought
it
and
it
fell
dead
in
a
fortnight
if
it
had
ever
been
alive
the
author
'
s
thoughts
were
diverted
to
another
groove
just
then
by
the
discovery
that
she
was
going
to
have
a
third
child
and
the
collapse
of
her
poetical
venture
had
perhaps
less
effect
upon
her
mind
than
it
might
have
done
if
she
had
been
domestically
unoccupied
her
husband
had
paid
the
publisher
'
s
bill
with
the
doctor
'
s
and
there
it
all
had
ended
for
the
time
but
though
less
than
a
poet
of
her
century
ella
was
more
than
a
mere
multiplier
of
her
kind
and
latterly
she
had
begun
to
feel
the
old
afflatus
once
more
and
now
by
an
odd
conjunction
she
found
herself
in
the
rooms
of
robert
trewe
she
thoughtfully
rose
from
her
chair
and
searched
the
apartment
with
the
interest
of
a
fellow
-
tradesman
yes
the
volume
of
his
own
verse
was
among
the
rest
though
quite
familiar
with
its
contents
she
read
it
here
as
if
it
spoke
aloud
to
her
then
called
up
mrs
hooper
the
landlady
for
some
trivial
service
and
inquired
again
about
the
young
man
'
well
i
am
sure
you
'
d
be
interested
in
him
ma
'
am
if
you
could
see
him
only
he
is
so
shy
that
i
do
not
suppose
you
will
mrs
hooper
seemed
nothing
loth
to
minister
to
her
tenant
'
s
curiosity
about
her
predecessor
lived
here
long
yes
nearly
two
years
he
keeps
on
his
rooms
even
when
he
is
not
here
the
soft
air
of
this
place
suits
his
chest
and
he
likes
to
be
able
to
come
back
at
any
time
he
is
mostly
writing
or
reading
and
does
not
see
many
people
though
for
the
matter
of
that
he
is
such
a
good
kind
young
fellow
that
folks
would
only
be
too
glad
to
be
friendly
with
him
if
they
knew
him
you
do
not
meet
kind
-
hearted
people
every
day
'
ah
he
is
kind
-
hearted
and
good
'
yes
he
will
oblige
me
in
anything
if
i
ask
him
mr
trewe
i
say
to
him
sometimes
you
are
rather
out
of
spirits
well
i
am
mrs
hooper
he
will
say
though
i
do
not
know
how
you
should
find
it
out
why
not
take
a
little
change
i
ask
then
in
a
day
or
two
he
will
say
that
he
will
take
a
trip
to
paris
or
norway
or
somewhere
and
i
assure
you
he
comes
back
all
the
better
for
it
'
ah
indeed
his
is
a
sensitive
nature
no
doubt
'
yes
still
he
is
odd
in
some
things
once
when
he
had
finished
a
poem
of
his
composition
late
at
night
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
rehearsing
it
and
the
floors
being
so
thin
jerry
-
built
houses
you
know
though
i
say
it
myself
he
kept
me
awake
up
above
him
till
i
wished
him
further
but
we
get
on
very
well
this
was
but
the
beginning
of
a
series
of
conversations
about
the
rising
poet
as
the
days
went
on
on
one
of
these
occasions
mrs
hooper
drew
ella
'
s
attention
to
what
she
had
not
noticed
before
minute
scribblings
in
pencil
on
the
wall
-
paper
behind
the
curtains
at
the
head
of
the
bed
'
o
let
me
look
said
mrs
marchmill
unable
to
conceal
a
rush
of
tender
curiosity
as
she
bent
her
pretty
face
close
to
the
wall
'
these
said
mrs
hooper
with
the
manner
of
a
woman
who
knew
things
are
the
very
beginnings
and
first
thoughts
of
his
verses
he
has
tried
to
rub
most
of
them
out
but
you
can
read
them
still
my
belief
is
that
he
wakes
up
in
the
night
you
know
with
some
rhyme
in
his
head
and
jots
it
down
there
on
the
wall
lest
he
should
forget
it
by
the
morning
some
of
these
very
lines
you
see
here
i
have
seen
afterwards
in
print
in
the
magazines
some
are
newer
indeed
i
have
not
seen
that
one
before
it
must
have
been
done
only
a
few
days
ago
'
o
yes
ella
marchmill
flushed
without
knowing
why
and
suddenly
wished
her
companion
would
go
away
now
that
the
information
was
imparted
an
indescribable
consciousness
of
personal
interest
rather
than
literary
made
her
anxious
to
read
the
inscription
alone
and
she
accordingly
waited
till
she
could
do
so
with
a
sense
that
a
great
store
of
emotion
would
be
enjoyed
in
the
act
perhaps
because
the
sea
was
choppy
outside
the
island
ella
'
s
husband
found
it
much
pleasanter
to
go
sailing
and
steaming
about
without
his
wife
who
was
a
bad
sailor
than
with
her
he
did
not
disdain
to
go
thus
alone
on
board
the
steamboats
of
the
cheap
-
trippers
where
there
was
dancing
by
moonlight
and
where
the
couples
would
come
suddenly
down
with
a
lurch
into
each
other
'
s
arms
for
as
he
blandly
told
her
the
company
was
too
mixed
for
him
to
take
her
amid
such
scenes
thus
while
this
thriving
manufacturer
got
a
great
deal
of
change
and
sea
-
air
out
of
his
sojourn
here
the
life
external
at
least
of
ella
was
monotonous
enough
and
mainly
consisted
in
passing
a
certain
number
of
hours
each
day
in
bathing
and
walking
up
and
down
a
stretch
of
shore
but
the
poetic
impulse
having
again
waxed
strong
she
was
possessed
by
an
inner
flame
which
left
her
hardly
conscious
of
what
was
proceeding
around
her
she
had
read
till
she
knew
by
heart
trewe
'
s
last
little
volume
of
verses
and
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
vainly
attempting
to
rival
some
of
them
till
in
her
failure
she
burst
into
tears
the
personal
element
in
the
magnetic
attraction
exercised
by
this
circumambient
unapproachable
master
of
hers
was
so
much
stronger
than
the
intellectual
and
abstract
that
she
could
not
understand
it
to
be
sure
she
was
surrounded
noon
and
night
by
his
customary
environment
which
literally
whispered
of
him
to
her
at
every
moment
but
he
was
a
man
she
had
never
seen
and
that
all
that
moved
her
was
the
instinct
to
specialize
a
waiting
emotion
on
the
first
fit
thing
that
came
to
hand
did
not
of
course
suggest
itself
to
ella
in
the
natural
way
of
passion
under
the
too
practical
conditions
which
civilization
has
devised
for
its
fruition
her
husband
'
s
love
for
her
had
not
survived
except
in
the
form
of
fitful
friendship
any
more
than
or
even
so
much
as
her
own
for
him
and
being
a
woman
of
very
living
ardours
that
required
sustenance
of
some
sort
they
were
beginning
to
feed
on
this
chancing
material
which
was
indeed
of
a
quality
far
better
than
chance
usually
offers
one
day
the
children
had
been
playing
hide
-
and
-
seek
in
a
closet
whence
in
their
excitement
they
pulled
out
some
clothing
mrs
hooper
explained
that
it
belonged
to
mr
trewe
and
hung
it
up
in
the
closet
again
possessed
of
her
fantasy
ella
went
later
in
the
afternoon
when
nobody
was
in
that
part
of
the
house
opened
the
closet
unhitched
one
of
the
articles
a
mackintosh
and
put
it
on
with
the
waterproof
cap
belonging
to
it
'
the
mantle
of
elijah
she
said
would
it
might
inspire
me
to
rival
him
glorious
genius
that
he
is
her
eyes
always
grew
wet
when
she
thought
like
that
and
she
turned
to
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
his
heart
had
beat
inside
that
coat
and
his
brain
had
worked
under
that
hat
at
levels
of
thought
she
would
never
reach
the
consciousness
of
her
weakness
beside
him
made
her
feel
quite
sick
before
she
had
got
the
things
off
her
the
door
opened
and
her
husband
entered
the
room
'
what
the
devil
she
blushed
and
removed
them
'
i
found
them
in
the
closet
here
she
said
and
put
them
on
in
a
freak
what
have
i
else
to
do
you
are
always
away
'
always
away
well
that
evening
she
had
a
further
talk
with
the
landlady
who
might
herself
have
nourished
a
half
-
tender
regard
for
the
poet
so
ready
was
she
to
discourse
ardently
about
him
'
you
are
interested
in
mr
trewe
i
know
ma
'
am
she
said
and
he
has
just
sent
to
say
that
he
is
going
to
call
to
-
morrow
afternoon
to
look
up
some
books
of
his
that
he
wants
if
i
will
be
in
and
he
may
select
them
from
your
room
'
o
yes
'
you
could
very
well
meet
mr
trewe
then
if
you
'
d
like
to
be
in
the
way
she
promised
with
secret
delight
and
went
to
bed
musing
of
him
next
morning
her
husband
observed
i
'
ve
been
thinking
of
what
you
said
ell
that
i
have
gone
about
a
good
deal
and
left
you
without
much
to
amuse
you
perhaps
it
is
true
to
-
day
as
there
'
s
not
much
sea
i
will
take
you
with
me
on
board
the
yacht
for
the
first
time
in
her
experience
of
such
an
offer
ella
was
not
glad
but
she
accepted
it
for
the
moment
the
time
for
setting
out
drew
near
and
she
went
to
get
ready
she
stood
reflecting
the
longing
to
see
the
poet
she
was
now
distinctly
in
love
with
overpowered
all
other
considerations
'
i
do
not
want
to
go
she
said
to
herself
i
ca
not
bear
to
be
away
and
i
wo
not
go
she
told
her
husband
that
she
had
changed
her
mind
about
wishing
to
sail
he
was
indifferent
and
went
his
way
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
house
was
quiet
the
children
having
gone
out
upon
the
sands
the
blinds
waved
in
the
sunshine
to
the
soft
steady
stroke
of
the
sea
beyond
the
wall
and
the
notes
of
the
green
silesian
band
a
troop
of
foreign
gentlemen
hired
for
the
season
had
drawn
almost
all
the
residents
and
promenaders
away
from
the
vicinity
of
coburg
house
a
knock
was
audible
at
the
door
mrs
marchmill
did
not
hear
any
servant
go
to
answer
it
and
she
became
impatient
the
books
were
in
the
room
where
she
sat
but
nobody
came
up
she
rang
the
bell
'
there
is
some
person
waiting
at
the
door
she
said
'
o
no
ma
'
am
he
is
gone
long
ago
i
answered
it
mrs
hooper
came
in
herself
'
so
disappointing
she
said
mr
trewe
not
coming
after
all
'
but
i
heard
him
knock
i
fancy
'
no
that
was
somebody
inquiring
for
lodgings
who
came
to
the
wrong
house
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
mr
trewe
sent
a
note
just
before
lunch
to
say
i
need
not
get
any
tea
for
him
as
he
should
not
require
the
books
and
would
not
come
to
select
them
ella
was
miserable
and
for
a
long
time
could
not
even
re
-
read
his
mournful
ballad
on
severed
lives
so
aching
was
her
erratic
little
heart
and
so
tearful
her
eyes
when
the
children
came
in
with
wet
stockings
and
ran
up
to
her
to
tell
her
of
their
adventures
she
could
not
feel
that
she
cared
about
them
half
as
much
as
usual
'
mrs
hooper
have
you
a
photograph
of
the
gentleman
who
lived
here
she
was
getting
to
be
curiously
shy
in
mentioning
his
name
'
why
yes
it
is
in
the
ornamental
frame
on
the
mantelpiece
in
your
own
bedroom
ma
'
am
'
no
the
royal
duke
and
duchess
are
in
that
'
yes
so
they
are
but
he
is
behind
them
he
belongs
rightly
to
that
frame
which
i
bought
on
purpose
but
as
he
went
away
he
said
cover
me
up
from
those
strangers
that
are
coming
for
god
'
s
sake
i
do
not
want
them
staring
at
me
and
i
am
sure
they
wo
not
want
me
staring
at
them
so
i
slipped
in
the
duke
and
duchess
temporarily
in
front
of
him
as
they
had
no
frame
and
royalties
are
more
suitable
for
letting
furnished
than
a
private
young
man
if
you
take
em
out
you
will
see
him
under
lord
ma
'
am
he
would
not
mind
if
he
knew
it
he
did
not
think
the
next
tenant
would
be
such
an
attractive
lady
as
you
or
he
would
not
have
thought
of
hiding
himself
perhaps
'
is
he
handsome
she
asked
timidly
i
call
him
so
some
perhaps
would
not
'
should
i
she
asked
with
eagerness
'
i
think
you
would
though
some
would
say
he
is
more
striking
than
handsome
a
large
-
eyed
thoughtful
fellow
you
know
with
a
very
electric
flash
in
his
eye
when
he
looks
round
quickly
such
as
you
'
d
expect
a
poet
to
be
who
does
not
get
his
living
by
it
'
how
old
is
he
'
several
years
older
than
yourself
ma
'
am
about
thirty
-
one
or
two
i
think
ella
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
few
months
over
thirty
herself
but
she
did
not
look
nearly
so
much
though
so
immature
in
nature
she
was
entering
on
that
tract
of
life
in
which
emotional
women
begin
to
suspect
that
last
love
may
be
stronger
than
first
love
and
she
would
soon
alas
enter
on
the
still
more
melancholy
tract
when
at
least
the
vainer
ones
of
her
sex
shrink
from
receiving
a
male
visitor
otherwise
than
with
their
backs
to
the
window
or
the
blinds
half
down
she
reflected
on
mrs
hooper
'
s
remark
and
said
no
more
about
age
just
then
a
telegram
was
brought
up
it
came
from
her
husband
who
had
gone
down
the
channel
as
far
as
budmouth
with
his
friends
in
the
yacht
and
would
not
be
able
to
get
back
till
next
day
after
her
light
dinner
ella
idled
about
the
shore
with
the
children
till
dusk
thinking
of
the
yet
uncovered
photograph
in
her
room
with
a
serene
sense
of
something
ecstatic
to
come
for
with
the
subtle
luxuriousness
of
fancy
in
which
this
young
woman
was
an
adept
on
learning
that
her
husband
was
to
be
absent
that
night
she
had
refrained
from
incontinently
rushing
upstairs
and
opening
the
picture
-
frame
preferring
to
reserve
the
inspection
till
she
could
be
alone
and
a
more
romantic
tinge
be
imparted
to
the
occasion
by
silence
candles
solemn
sea
and
stars
outside
than
was
afforded
by
the
garish
afternoon
sunlight
the
children
had
been
sent
to
bed
and
ella
soon
followed
though
it
was
not
yet
ten
o
'
clock
to
gratify
her
passionate
curiosity
she
now
made
her
preparations
first
getting
rid
of
superfluous
garments
and
putting
on
her
dressing
-
gown
then
arranging
a
chair
in
front
of
the
table
and
reading
several
pages
of
trewe
'
s
tenderest
utterances
then
she
fetched
the
portrait
-
frame
to
the
light
opened
the
back
took
out
the
likeness
and
set
it
up
before
her
it
was
a
striking
countenance
to
look
upon
the
poet
wore
a
luxuriant
black
moustache
and
imperial
and
a
slouched
hat
which
shaded
the
forehead
the
large
dark
eyes
described
by
the
landlady
showed
an
unlimited
capacity
for
misery
they
looked
out
from
beneath
well
-
shaped
brows
as
if
they
were
reading
the
universe
in
the
microcosm
of
the
confronter
'
s
face
and
were
not
altogether
overjoyed
at
what
the
spectacle
portended
ella
murmured
in
her
lowest
richest
tenderest
tone
and
it
is
you
who
'
ve
so
cruelly
eclipsed
me
these
many
times
as
she
gazed
long
at
the
portrait
she
fell
into
thought
till
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
touched
the
cardboard
with
her
lips
then
she
laughed
with
a
nervous
lightness
and
wiped
her
eyes
she
thought
how
wicked
she
was
a
woman
having
a
husband
and
three
children
to
let
her
mind
stray
to
a
stranger
in
this
unconscionable
manner
no
he
was
not
a
stranger
she
knew
his
thoughts
and
feelings
as
well
as
she
knew
her
own
they
were
in
fact
the
self
-
same
thoughts
and
feelings
as
hers
which
her
husband
distinctly
lacked
perhaps
luckily
for
himself
considering
that
he
had
to
provide
for
family
expenses
'
he
is
nearer
my
real
self
he
is
more
intimate
with
the
real
me
than
will
is
after
all
even
though
i
'
ve
never
seen
him
she
said
she
laid
his
book
and
picture
on
the
table
at
the
bedside
and
when
she
was
reclining
on
the
pillow
she
re
-
read
those
of
robert
trewe
'
s
verses
which
she
had
marked
from
time
to
time
as
most
touching
and
true
putting
these
aside
she
set
up
the
photograph
on
its
edge
upon
the
coverlet
and
contemplated
it
as
she
lay
then
she
scanned
again
by
the
light
of
the
candle
the
half
-
obliterated
pencillings
on
the
wall
-
paper
beside
her
head
there
they
were
phrases
couplets
bouts
-
rimes
beginnings
and
middles
of
lines
ideas
in
the
rough
like
shelley
'
s
scraps
and
the
least
of
them
so
intense
so
sweet
so
palpitating
that
it
seemed
as
if
his
very
breath
warm
and
loving
fanned
her
cheeks
from
those
walls
walls
that
had
surrounded
his
head
times
and
times
as
they
surrounded
her
own
now
he
must
often
have
put
up
his
hand
so
with
the
pencil
in
it
yes
the
writing
was
sideways
as
it
would
be
if
executed
by
one
who
extended
his
arm
thus
these
inscribed
shapes
of
the
poet
'
s
world
forms
more
real
than
living
man
nurslings
of
immortality
were
no
doubt
the
thoughts
and
spirit
-
strivings
which
had
come
to
him
in
the
dead
of
night
when
he
could
let
himself
go
and
have
no
fear
of
the
frost
of
criticism
no
doubt
they
had
often
been
written
up
hastily
by
the
light
of
the
moon
the
rays
of
the
lamp
in
the
blue
-
grey
dawn
in
full
daylight
perhaps
never
and
now
her
hair
was
dragging
where
his
arm
had
lain
when
he
secured
the
fugitive
fancies
she
was
sleeping
on
a
poet
'
s
lips
immersed
in
the
very
essence
of
him
permeated
by
his
spirit
as
by
an
ether
while
she
was
dreaming
the
minutes
away
thus
a
footstep
came
upon
the
stairs
and
in
a
moment
she
heard
her
husband
'
s
heavy
step
on
the
landing
immediately
without
'
ell
where
are
you
what
possessed
her
she
could
not
have
described
but
with
an
instinctive
objection
to
let
her
husband
know
what
she
had
been
doing
she
slipped
the
photograph
under
the
pillow
just
as
he
flung
open
the
door
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
dined
not
badly
'
o
i
beg
pardon
said
william
marchmill
have
you
a
headache
i
am
afraid
i
have
disturbed
you
'
no
i
'
ve
not
got
a
headache
said
she
how
is
it
you
'
ve
come
'
well
we
found
we
could
get
back
in
very
good
time
after
all
and
i
did
not
want
to
make
another
day
of
it
because
of
going
somewhere
else
to
-
morrow
'
shall
i
come
down
again
'
o
no
i
am
as
tired
as
a
dog
i
'
ve
had
a
good
feed
and
i
shall
turn
in
straight
off
i
want
to
get
out
at
six
o
'
clock
to

morrow
if
i
can
i
sha
not
disturb
you
by
my
getting
up
it
will
be
long
before
you
are
awake
and
he
came
forward
into
the
room
while
her
eyes
followed
his
movements
ella
softly
pushed
the
photograph
further
out
of
sight
'
sure
you
are
not
ill
he
asked
bending
over
her
'
no
only
wicked
'
never
mind
that
and
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
next
morning
marchmill
was
called
at
six
o
'
clock
and
in
waking
and
yawning
she
heard
him
muttering
to
himself
what
the
deuce
is
this
that
'
s
been
crackling
under
me
so
imagining
her
asleep
he
searched
round
him
and
withdrew
something
through
her
half
-
opened
eyes
she
perceived
it
to
be
mr
trewe
'
well
i
am
damned
her
husband
exclaimed
'
what
dear
said
she
'
o
you
are
awake
ha
ha
'
what
do
you
mean
'
some
bloke
'
s
photograph
a
friend
of
our
landlady
'
s
i
suppose
i
wonder
how
it
came
here
whisked
off
the
table
by
accident
perhaps
when
they
were
making
the
bed
'
i
was
looking
at
it
yesterday
and
it
must
have
dropped
in
then
'
o
he
is
a
friend
of
yours
bless
his
picturesque
heart
ella
'
s
loyalty
to
the
object
of
her
admiration
could
not
endure
to
hear
him
ridiculed
he
is
a
clever
man
she
said
with
a
tremor
in
her
gentle
voice
which
she
herself
felt
to
be
absurdly
uncalled
for
'
he
is
a
rising
poet
the
gentleman
who
occupied
two
of
these
rooms
before
we
came
though
i
'
ve
never
seen
him
'
how
do
you
know
if
you
'
ve
never
seen
him
'
mrs
hooper
told
me
when
she
showed
me
the
photograph
'
o
well
i
must
up
and
be
off
i
shall
be
home
rather
early
sorry
i
ca
not
take
you
to
-
day
dear
mind
the
children
do
not
go
getting
drowned
that
day
mrs
marchmill
inquired
if
mr
trewe
were
likely
to
call
at
any
other
time
'
yes
said
mrs
hooper
he
is
coming
this
day
week
to
stay
with
a
friend
near
here
till
you
leave
he
will
be
sure
to
call
marchmill
did
return
quite
early
in
the
afternoon
and
opening
some
letters
which
had
arrived
in
his
absence
declared
suddenly
that
he
and
his
family
would
have
to
leave
a
week
earlier
than
they
had
expected
to
do
in
short
in
three
days
'
surely
we
can
stay
a
week
longer
she
pleaded
i
like
it
here
'
i
do
not
it
is
getting
rather
slow
'
then
you
might
leave
me
and
the
children
'
how
perverse
you
are
ell
what
'
s
the
use
and
have
to
come
to
fetch
you
no
we
will
all
return
together
and
we
will
make
out
our
time
in
north
wales
or
brighton
a
little
later
on
besides
you
'
ve
three
days
longer
yet
it
seemed
to
be
her
doom
not
to
meet
the
man
for
whose
rival
talent
she
had
a
despairing
admiration
and
to
whose
person
she
was
now
absolutely
attached
yet
she
determined
to
make
a
last
effort
and
having
gathered
from
her
landlady
that
trewe
was
living
in
a
lonely
spot
not
far
from
the
fashionable
town
on
the
island
opposite
she
crossed
over
in
the
packet
from
the
neighbouring
pier
the
following
afternoon
what
a
useless
journey
it
was
ella
knew
but
vaguely
where
the
house
stood
and
when
she
fancied
she
had
found
it
and
ventured
to
inquire
of
a
pedestrian
if
he
lived
there
the
answer
returned
by
the
man
was
that
he
did
not
know
and
if
he
did
live
there
how
could
she
call
upon
him
some
women
might
have
the
assurance
to
do
it
but
she
had
not
how
crazy
he
would
think
her
she
might
have
asked
him
to
call
upon
her
perhaps
but
she
had
not
the
courage
for
that
either
she
lingered
mournfully
about
the
picturesque
seaside
eminence
till
it
was
time
to
return
to
the
town
and
enter
the
steamer
for
recrossing
reaching
home
for
dinner
without
having
been
greatly
missed
at
the
last
moment
unexpectedly
enough
her
husband
said
that
he
should
have
no
objection
to
letting
her
and
the
children
stay
on
till
the
end
of
the
week
since
she
wished
to
do
so
if
she
felt
herself
able
to
get
home
without
him
she
concealed
the
pleasure
this
extension
of
time
gave
her
and
marchmill
went
off
the
next
morning
alone
but
the
week
passed
and
trewe
did
not
call
on
saturday
morning
the
remaining
members
of
the
marchmill
family
departed
from
the
place
which
had
been
productive
of
so
much
fervour
in
her
the
dreary
dreary
train
the
sun
shining
in
moted
beams
upon
the
hot
cushions
the
dusty
permanent
way
the
mean
rows
of
wire
these
things
were
her
accompaniment
while
out
of
the
window
the
deep
blue
sea
-
levels
disappeared
from
her
gaze
and
with
them
her
poet
'
s
home
heavy
-
hearted
she
tried
to
read
and
wept
instead
mr
marchmill
was
in
a
thriving
way
of
business
and
he
and
his
family
lived
in
a
large
new
house
which
stood
in
rather
extensive
grounds
a
few
miles
outside
the
city
wherein
he
carried
on
his
trade
ella
'
s
life
was
lonely
here
as
the
suburban
life
is
apt
to
be
particularly
at
certain
seasons
and
she
had
ample
time
to
indulge
her
taste
for
lyric
and
elegiac
composition
she
had
hardly
got
back
when
she
encountered
a
piece
by
robert
trewe
in
the
new
number
of
her
favourite
magazine
which
must
have
been
written
almost
immediately
before
her
visit
to
solentsea
for
it
contained
the
very
couplet
she
had
seen
pencilled
on
the
wallpaper
by
the
bed
and
mrs
hooper
had
declared
to
be
recent
ella
could
resist
no
longer
but
seizing
a
pen
impulsively
wrote
to
him
as
a
brother
-
poet
using
the
name
of
john
ivy
congratulating
him
in
her
letter
on
his
triumphant
executions
in
metre
and
rhythm
of
thoughts
that
moved
his
soul
as
compared
with
her
own
brow
-
beaten
efforts
in
the
same
pathetic
trade
to
this
address
there
came
a
response
in
a
few
days
little
as
she
had
dared
to
hope
for
it
a
civil
and
brief
note
in
which
the
young
poet
stated
that
though
he
was
not
well
acquainted
with
mr
ivy
'
s
verse
he
recalled
the
name
as
being
one
he
had
seen
attached
to
some
very
promising
pieces
that
he
was
glad
to
gain
mr
ivy
'
s
acquaintance
by
letter
and
should
certainly
look
with
much
interest
for
his
productions
in
the
future
there
must
have
been
something
juvenile
or
timid
in
her
own
epistle
as
one
ostensibly
coming
from
a
man
she
declared
to
herself
for
trewe
quite
adopted
the
tone
of
an
elder
and
superior
in
this
reply
but
what
did
it
matter
he
had
replied
he
had
written
to
her
with
his
own
hand
from
that
very
room
she
knew
so
well
for
he
was
now
back
again
in
his
quarters
the
correspondence
thus
begun
was
continued
for
two
months
or
more
ella
marchmill
sending
him
from
time
to
time
some
that
she
considered
to
be
the
best
of
her
pieces
which
he
very
kindly
accepted
though
he
did
not
say
he
sedulously
read
them
nor
did
he
send
her
any
of
his
own
in
return
ella
would
have
been
more
hurt
at
this
than
she
was
if
she
had
not
known
that
trewe
laboured
under
the
impression
that
she
was
one
of
his
own
sex
yet
the
situation
was
unsatisfactory
a
flattering
little
voice
told
her
that
were
he
only
to
see
her
matters
would
be
otherwise
no
doubt
she
would
have
helped
on
this
by
making
a
frank
confession
of
womanhood
to
begin
with
if
something
had
not
happened
to
her
delight
to
render
it
unnecessary
a
friend
of
her
husband
'
s
the
editor
of
the
most
important
newspaper
in
the
city
and
county
who
was
dining
with
them
one
day
observed
during
their
conversation
about
the
poet
that
his
(
the
editor
'
s
)
brother
the
landscape
-
painter
was
a
friend
of
mr
trewe
'
s
and
that
the
two
men
were
at
that
very
moment
in
wales
together
ella
was
slightly
acquainted
with
the
editor
'
s
brother
the
next
morning
down
she
sat
and
wrote
inviting
him
to
stay
at
her
house
for
a
short
time
on
his
way
back
and
requesting
him
to
bring
with
him
if
practicable
his
companion
mr
trewe
whose
acquaintance
she
was
anxious
to
make
the
answer
arrived
after
some
few
days
her
correspondent
and
his
friend
trewe
would
have
much
satisfaction
in
accepting
her
invitation
on
their
way
southward
which
would
be
on
such
and
such
a
day
in
the
following
week
ella
was
blithe
and
buoyant
her
scheme
had
succeeded
her
beloved
though
as
yet
unseen
one
was
coming
behold
he
standeth
behind
our
wall
he
looked
forth
at
the
windows
showing
himself
through
the
lattice
she
thought
ecstatically
and
lo
the
winter
is
past
the
rain
is
over
and
gone
the
flowers
appear
on
the
earth
the
time
of
the
singing
of
birds
is
come
and
the
voice
of
the
turtle
is
heard
in
our
land
but
it
was
necessary
to
consider
the
details
of
lodging
and
feeding
him
this
she
did
most
solicitously
and
awaited
the
pregnant
day
and
hour
it
was
about
five
in
the
afternoon
when
she
heard
a
ring
at
the
door
and
the
editor
'
s
brother
'
s
voice
in
the
hall
poetess
as
she
was
or
as
she
thought
herself
she
had
not
been
too
sublime
that
day
to
dress
with
infinite
trouble
in
a
fashionable
robe
of
rich
material
having
a
faint
resemblance
to
the
chiton
of
the
greeks
a
style
just
then
in
vogue
among
ladies
of
an
artistic
and
romantic
turn
which
had
been
obtained
by
ella
of
her
bond
street
dressmaker
when
she
was
last
in
london
her
visitor
entered
the
drawing
-
room
she
looked
towards
his
rear
nobody
else
came
through
the
door
where
in
the
name
of
the
god
of
love
was
robert
trewe
'
o
i
am
sorry
said
the
painter
after
their
introductory
words
had
been
spoken
trewe
is
a
curious
fellow
you
know
mrs
marchmill
he
said
he
'
d
come
then
he
said
he
could
not
he
is
rather
dusty
we
'
ve
been
doing
a
few
miles
with
knapsacks
you
know
and
he
wanted
to
get
on
home
'
he
he
is
not
coming
'
he
is
not
and
he
asked
me
to
make
his
apologies
'
when
did
you
p
-
p
-
part
from
him
she
asked
her
nether
lip
starting
off
quivering
so
much
that
it
was
like
a
tremolo
-
stop
opened
in
her
speech
she
longed
to
run
away
from
this
dreadful
bore
and
cry
her
eyes
out
'
just
now
in
the
turnpike
road
yonder
there
'
what
he
has
actually
gone
past
my
gates
'
yes
when
we
got
to
them
handsome
gates
they
are
too
the
finest
bit
of
modern
wrought
-
iron
work
i
have
seen
when
we
came
to
them
we
stopped
talking
there
a
little
while
and
then
he
wished
me
good
-
bye
and
went
on
the
truth
is
he
is
a
little
bit
depressed
just
now
and
does
not
want
to
see
anybody
he
is
a
very
good
fellow
and
a
warm
friend
but
a
little
uncertain
and
gloomy
sometimes
he
thinks
too
much
of
things
his
poetry
is
rather
too
erotic
and
passionate
you
know
for
some
tastes
and
he
has
just
come
in
for
a
terrible
slating
from
the
review
that
was
published
yesterday
he
saw
a
copy
of
it
at
the
station
by
accident
perhaps
you
'
ve
read
it
'
no
'
so
much
the
better
o
it
is
not
worth
thinking
of
just
one
of
those
articles
written
to
order
to
please
the
narrow
-
minded
set
of
subscribers
upon
whom
the
circulation
depends
but
he
is
upset
by
it
he
says
it
is
the
misrepresentation
that
hurts
him
so
that
though
he
can
stand
a
fair
attack
he
ca
not
stand
lies
that
he
is
powerless
to
refute
and
stop
from
spreading
that
'
s
just
trewe
'
s
weak
point
he
lives
so
much
by
himself
that
these
things
affect
him
much
more
than
they
would
if
he
were
in
the
bustle
of
fashionable
or
commercial
life
so
he
would
not
come
here
making
the
excuse
that
it
all
looked
so
new
and
monied
if
you
will
pardon
'
but
he
must
have
known
there
was
sympathy
here
has
he
never
said
anything
about
getting
letters
from
this
address
'
yes
yes
he
has
from
john
ivy
perhaps
a
relative
of
yours
he
thought
visiting
here
at
the
time
'
did
he
like
ivy
did
he
say
'
well
i
do
not
know
that
he
took
any
great
interest
in
ivy
'
or
in
his
poems
'
or
in
his
poems
so
far
as
i
know
that
is
robert
trewe
took
no
interest
in
her
house
in
her
poems
or
in
their
writer
as
soon
as
she
could
get
away
she
went
into
the
nursery
and
tried
to
let
off
her
emotion
by
unnecessarily
kissing
the
children
till
she
had
a
sudden
sense
of
disgust
at
being
reminded
how
plain
-
looking
they
were
like
their
father
the
obtuse
and
single
-
minded
landscape
-
painter
never
once
perceived
from
her
conversation
that
it
was
only
trewe
she
wanted
and
not
himself
he
made
the
best
of
his
visit
seeming
to
enjoy
the
society
of
ella
'
s
husband
who
also
took
a
great
fancy
to
him
and
showed
him
everywhere
about
the
neighbourhood
neither
of
them
noticing
ella
'
s
mood
the
painter
had
been
gone
only
a
day
or
two
when
while
sitting
upstairs
alone
one
morning
she
glanced
over
the
london
paper
just
arrived
and
read
the
following
paragraph
suicide
of
a
poet
'
mr
robert
trewe
who
has
been
favourably
known
for
some
years
as
one
of
our
rising
lyrists
committed
suicide
at
his
lodgings
at
solentsea
on
saturday
evening
last
by
shooting
himself
in
the
right
temple
with
a
revolver
readers
hardly
need
to
be
reminded
that
mr
trewe
has
recently
attracted
the
attention
of
a
much
wider
public
than
had
hitherto
known
him
by
his
new
volume
of
verse
mostly
of
an
impassioned
kind
entitled
lyrics
to
a
woman
unknown
which
has
been
already
favourably
noticed
in
these
pages
for
the
extraordinary
gamut
of
feeling
it
traverses
and
which
has
been
made
the
subject
of
a
severe
if
not
ferocious
criticism
in
the
review
it
is
supposed
though
not
certainly
known
that
the
article
may
have
partially
conduced
to
the
sad
act
as
a
copy
of
the
review
in
question
was
found
on
his
writing
-
table
and
he
has
been
observed
to
be
in
a
somewhat
depressed
state
of
mind
since
the
critique
appeared
then
came
the
report
of
the
inquest
at
which
the
following
letter
was
read
it
having
been
addressed
to
a
friend
at
a
distance
dear
before
these
lines
reach
your
hands
i
shall
be
delivered
from
the
inconveniences
of
seeing
hearing
and
knowing
more
of
the
things
around
me
i
will
not
trouble
you
by
giving
my
reasons
for
the
step
i
have
taken
though
i
can
assure
you
they
were
sound
and
logical
perhaps
had
i
been
blessed
with
a
mother
or
a
sister
or
a
female
friend
of
another
sort
tenderly
devoted
to
me
i
might
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
continue
my
present
existence
i
have
long
dreamt
of
such
an
unattainable
creature
as
you
know
and
she
this
undiscoverable
elusive
one
inspired
my
last
volume
the
imaginary
woman
alone
for
in
spite
of
what
has
been
said
in
some
quarters
there
is
no
real
woman
behind
the
title
she
has
continued
to
the
last
unrevealed
unmet
unwon
i
think
it
desirable
to
mention
this
in
order
that
no
blame
may
attach
to
any
real
woman
as
having
been
the
cause
of
my
decease
by
cruel
or
cavalier
treatment
of
me
tell
my
landlady
that
i
am
sorry
to
have
caused
her
this
unpleasantness
but
my
occupancy
of
the
rooms
will
soon
be
forgotten
there
are
ample
funds
in
my
name
at
the
bank
to
pay
all
expenses
r
trewe
ella
sat
for
a
while
as
if
stunned
then
rushed
into
the
adjoining
chamber
and
flung
herself
upon
her
face
on
the
bed
her
grief
and
distraction
shook
her
to
pieces
and
she
lay
in
this
frenzy
of
sorrow
for
more
than
an
hour
broken
words
came
every
now
and
then
from
her
quivering
lips
o
if
he
had
only
known
of
me
known
of
me
me
o
if
i
had
only
once
met
him
only
once
and
put
my
hand
upon
his
hot
forehead
kissed
him
let
him
know
how
i
loved
him
that
i
would
have
suffered
shame
and
scorn
would
have
lived
and
died
for
him
perhaps
it
would
have
saved
his
dear
life
but
no
it
was
not
allowed
god
is
a
jealous
god
and
that
happiness
was
not
for
him
and
me
all
possibilities
were
over
the
meeting
was
stultified
yet
it
was
almost
visible
to
her
in
her
fantasy
even
now
though
it
could
never
be
substantiated
-
the
hour
which
might
have
been
yet
might
not
be
which
man
'
s
and
woman
'
s
heart
conceived
and
bore
yet
whereof
life
was
barren
she
wrote
to
the
landlady
at
solentsea
in
the
third
person
in
as
subdued
a
style
as
she
could
command
enclosing
a
postal
order
for
a
sovereign
and
informing
mrs
hooper
that
mrs
marchmill
had
seen
in
the
papers
the
sad
account
of
the
poet
'
s
death
and
having
been
as
mrs
hooper
was
aware
much
interested
in
mr
trewe
during
her
stay
at
coburg
house
she
would
be
obliged
if
mrs
hooper
could
obtain
a
small
portion
of
his
hair
before
his
coffin
was
closed
down
and
send
it
her
as
a
memorial
of
him
as
also
the
photograph
that
was
in
the
frame
by
the
return
-
post
a
letter
arrived
containing
what
had
been
requested
ella
wept
over
the
portrait
and
secured
it
in
her
private
drawer
the
lock
of
hair
she
tied
with
white
ribbon
and
put
in
her
bosom
whence
she
drew
it
and
kissed
it
every
now
and
then
in
some
unobserved
nook
'
what
'
s
the
matter
said
her
husband
looking
up
from
his
newspaper
on
one
of
these
occasions
crying
over
something
a
lock
of
hair
whose
is
it
'
he
is
dead
she
murmured
'
who
'
i
do
not
want
to
tell
you
will
just
now
unless
you
insist
she
said
a
sob
hanging
heavy
in
her
voice
'
o
all
right
'
do
you
mind
my
refusing
i
will
tell
you
some
day
'
it
does
not
matter
in
the
least
of
course
he
walked
away
whistling
a
few
bars
of
no
tune
in
particular
and
when
he
had
got
down
to
his
factory
in
the
city
the
subject
came
into
marchmill
'
s
head
again
he
too
was
aware
that
a
suicide
had
taken
place
recently
at
the
house
they
had
occupied
at
solentsea
having
seen
the
volume
of
poems
in
his
wife
'
s
hand
of
late
and
heard
fragments
of
the
landlady
'
s
conversation
about
trewe
when
they
were
her
tenants
he
all
at
once
said
to
himself
why
of
course
it
is
he
how
the
devil
did
she
get
to
know
him
what
sly
animals
women
are
then
he
placidly
dismissed
the
matter
and
went
on
with
his
daily
affairs
by
this
time
ella
at
home
had
come
to
a
determination
mrs
hooper
in
sending
the
hair
and
photograph
had
informed
her
of
the
day
of
the
funeral
and
as
the
morning
and
noon
wore
on
an
overpowering
wish
to
know
where
they
were
laying
him
took
possession
of
the
sympathetic
woman
caring
very
little
now
what
her
husband
or
any
one
else
might
think
of
her
eccentricities
she
wrote
marchmill
a
brief
note
stating
that
she
was
called
away
for
the
afternoon
and
evening
but
would
return
on
the
following
morning
this
she
left
on
his
desk
and
having
given
the
same
information
to
the
servants
went
out
of
the
house
on
foot
when
mr
marchmill
reached
home
early
in
the
afternoon
the
servants
looked
anxious
the
nurse
took
him
privately
aside
and
hinted
that
her
mistress
'
s
sadness
during
the
past
few
days
had
been
such
that
she
feared
she
had
gone
out
to
drown
herself
marchmill
reflected
upon
the
whole
he
thought
that
she
had
not
done
that
without
saying
whither
he
was
bound
he
also
started
off
telling
them
not
to
sit
up
for
him
he
drove
to
the
railway
-
station
and
took
a
ticket
for
solentsea
it
was
dark
when
he
reached
the
place
though
he
had
come
by
a
fast
train
and
he
knew
that
if
his
wife
had
preceded
him
thither
it
could
only
have
been
by
a
slower
train
arriving
not
a
great
while
before
his
own
the
season
at
solentsea
was
now
past
the
parade
was
gloomy
and
the
flys
were
few
and
cheap
he
asked
the
way
to
the
cemetery
and
soon
reached
it
the
gate
was
locked
but
the
keeper
let
him
in
declaring
however
that
there
was
nobody
within
the
precincts
although
it
was
not
late
the
autumnal
darkness
had
now
become
intense
and
he
found
some
difficulty
in
keeping
to
the
serpentine
path
which
led
to
the
quarter
where
as
the
man
had
told
him
the
one
or
two
interments
for
the
day
had
taken
place
he
stepped
upon
the
grass
and
stumbling
over
some
pegs
stooped
now
and
then
to
discern
if
possible
a
figure
against
the
sky
he
could
see
none
but
lighting
on
a
spot
where
the
soil
was
trodden
beheld
a
crouching
object
beside
a
newly
made
grave
she
heard
him
and
sprang
up
'
ell
how
silly
this
is
he
said
indignantly
running
away
from
home
i
never
heard
such
a
thing
of
course
i
am
not
jealous
of
this
unfortunate
man
but
it
is
too
ridiculous
that
you
a
married
woman
with
three
children
and
a
fourth
coming
should
go
losing
your
head
like
this
over
a
dead
lover
do
you
know
you
were
locked
in
you
might
not
have
been
able
to
get
out
all
night
she
did
not
answer
'
i
hope
it
did
not
go
far
between
you
and
him
for
your
own
sake
'
do
not
insult
me
will
'
mind
i
wo
not
have
any
more
of
this
sort
of
thing
do
you
hear
'
very
well
she
said
he
drew
her
arm
within
his
own
and
conducted
her
out
of
the
cemetery
it
was
impossible
to
get
back
that
night
and
not
wishing
to
be
recognized
in
their
present
sorry
condition
he
took
her
to
a
miserable
little
coffee
-
house
close
to
the
station
whence
they
departed
early
in
the
morning
travelling
almost
without
speaking
under
the
sense
that
it
was
one
of
those
dreary
situations
occurring
in
married
life
which
words
could
not
mend
and
reaching
their
own
door
at
noon
the
months
passed
and
neither
of
the
twain
ever
ventured
to
start
a
conversation
upon
this
episode
ella
seemed
to
be
only
too
frequently
in
a
sad
and
listless
mood
which
might
almost
have
been
called
pining
the
time
was
approaching
when
she
would
have
to
undergo
the
stress
of
childbirth
for
a
fourth
time
and
that
apparently
did
not
tend
to
raise
her
spirits
'
i
do
not
think
i
shall
get
over
it
this
time
she
said
one
day
'
pooh
what
childish
foreboding
why
should
not
it
be
as
well
now
as
ever
she
shook
her
head
i
feel
almost
sure
i
am
going
to
die
and
i
should
be
glad
if
it
were
not
for
nelly
and
frank
and
tiny
'
and
me
'
you
will
soon
find
somebody
to
fill
my
place
she
murmured
with
a
sad
smile
and
you
will
have
a
perfect
right
to
i
assure
you
of
that
'
ell
you
are
not
thinking
still
about
that
poetical
friend
of
yours
she
neither
admitted
nor
denied
the
charge
i
am
not
going
to
get
over
my
illness
this
time
she
reiterated
something
tells
me
i
sha
not
this
view
of
things
was
rather
a
bad
beginning
as
it
usually
is
and
in
fact
six
weeks
later
in
the
month
of
may
she
was
lying
in
her
room
pulseless
and
bloodless
with
hardly
strength
enough
left
to
follow
up
one
feeble
breath
with
another
the
infant
for
whose
unnecessary
life
she
was
slowly
parting
with
her
own
being
fat
and
well
just
before
her
death
she
spoke
to
marchmill
softly
'
will
i
want
to
confess
to
you
the
entire
circumstances
of
that
about
you
know
what
that
time
we
visited
solentsea
i
ca
not
tell
what
possessed
me
how
i
could
forget
you
so
my
husband
but
i
had
got
into
a
morbid
state
i
thought
you
had
been
unkind
that
you
had
neglected
me
that
you
were
not
up
to
my
intellectual
level
while
he
was
and
far
above
it
i
wanted
a
fuller
appreciator
perhaps
rather
than
another
lover
she
could
get
no
further
then
for
very
exhaustion
and
she
went
off
in
sudden
collapse
a
few
hours
later
without
having
said
anything
more
to
her
husband
on
the
subject
of
her
love
for
the
poet
william
marchmill
in
truth
like
most
husbands
of
several
years
'
standing
was
little
disturbed
by
retrospective
jealousies
and
had
not
shown
the
least
anxiety
to
press
her
for
confessions
concerning
a
man
dead
and
gone
beyond
any
power
of
inconveniencing
him
more
but
when
she
had
been
buried
a
couple
of
years
it
chanced
one
day
that
in
turning
over
some
forgotten
papers
that
he
wished
to
destroy
before
his
second
wife
entered
the
house
he
lighted
on
a
lock
of
hair
in
an
envelope
with
the
photograph
of
the
deceased
poet
a
date
being
written
on
the
back
in
his
late
wife
'
s
hand
it
was
that
of
the
time
they
spent
at
solentsea
marchmill
looked
long
and
musingly
at
the
hair
and
portrait
for
something
struck
him
fetching
the
little
boy
who
had
been
the
death
of
his
mother
now
a
noisy
toddler
he
took
him
on
his
knee
held
the
lock
of
hair
against
the
child
'
s
head
and
set
up
the
photograph
on
the
table
behind
so
that
he
could
closely
compare
the
features
each
countenance
presented
there
were
undoubtedly
strong
traces
of
resemblance
the
dreamy
and
peculiar
expression
of
the
poet
'
s
face
sat
as
the
transmitted
idea
upon
the
child
'
s
and
the
hair
was
of
the
same
hue
'
i
am
damned
if
i
did
not
think
so
murmured
marchmill
then
she
did
play
me
false
with
that
fellow
at
the
lodgings
let
me
see
the
dates
the
second
week
in
august
the
third
week
in
may
yes
yes
get
away
you
poor
little
brat
you
are
nothing
to
me
among
the
few
features
of
agricultural
england
which
retain
an
appearance
but
little
modified
by
the
lapse
of
centuries
may
be
reckoned
the
high
grassy
and
furzy
downs
coombs
or
ewe
-
leases
as
they
are
indifferently
called
that
fill
a
large
area
of
certain
counties
in
the
south
and
south
-
west
if
any
mark
of
human
occupation
is
met
with
hereon
it
usually
takes
the
form
of
the
solitary
cottage
of
some
shepherd
fifty
years
ago
such
a
lonely
cottage
stood
on
such
a
down
and
may
possibly
be
standing
there
now
in
spite
of
its
loneliness
however
the
spot
by
actual
measurement
was
not
more
than
five
miles
from
a
county
-
town
yet
that
affected
it
little
five
miles
of
irregular
upland
during
the
long
inimical
seasons
with
their
sleets
snows
rains
and
mists
afford
withdrawing
space
enough
to
