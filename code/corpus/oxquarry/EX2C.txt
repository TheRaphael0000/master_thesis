`
is
mr
linden
in
`
yes
who
is
it
`
my
name
'
s
owen
old
jack
however
had
already
recognized
owen
'
s
voice
and
came
to
the
door
wondering
what
he
wanted
`
as
i
was
going
home
i
heard
that
makehaste
and
sloggit
are
going
to
start
a
large
job
on
monday
so
i
thought
i
'
d
run
over
and
let
you
know
`
are
they
said
linden
`
i
will
go
and
see
them
in
the
morning
but
i
am
afraid
i
wo
not
stand
much
chance
because
a
lot
of
their
regular
hands
are
waiting
for
a
job
but
i
will
go
and
see
'
em
all
the
same
`
well
you
know
it
is
a
big
job
all
the
outside
of
that
block
at
the
corner
of
kerk
street
and
lord
street
they
are
almost
sure
to
want
a
few
extra
hands
`
yes
there
'
s
something
in
that
said
linden
`
anyhow
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
letting
me
know
but
come
in
out
of
the
rain
you
must
be
wet
through
`
no
i
wo
not
stay
responded
owen
`
i
do
not
want
to
stand
about
any
longer
than
i
can
help
in
these
wet
clothes
`
but
it
wo
not
take
you
a
minit
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
linden
insisted
`
i
wo
not
ask
you
to
stop
longer
than
that
owen
entered
the
old
man
closed
the
door
and
led
the
way
into
the
kitchen
at
one
side
of
the
fire
linden
'
s
wife
a
frail
-
looking
old
lady
with
white
hair
was
seated
in
a
large
armchair
knitting
linden
sat
down
in
a
similar
chair
on
the
other
side
the
two
grandchildren
a
boy
and
girl
about
seven
and
eight
years
respectively
were
still
seated
at
the
table
standing
by
the
side
of
the
dresser
at
one
end
of
the
room
was
a
treadle
sewing
machine
and
on
one
end
of
the
dresser
was
a
a
pile
of
sewing
ladies
'
blouses
in
process
of
making
this
was
another
instance
of
the
goodness
of
mr
sweater
from
whom
linden
'
s
daughter
-
in
-
law
obtained
the
work
it
was
not
much
because
she
was
only
able
to
do
it
in
her
spare
time
but
then
as
she
often
remarked
every
little
helped
the
floor
was
covered
with
linoleum
there
were
a
number
of
framed
pictures
on
the
walls
and
on
the
high
mantelshelf
were
a
number
of
brightly
polished
tins
and
copper
utensils
the
room
had
that
indescribably
homelike
cosy
air
that
is
found
only
in
those
houses
in
which
the
inhabitants
have
dwelt
for
a
very
long
time
the
younger
woman
was
already
pouring
out
a
cup
of
tea
old
mrs
linden
who
had
never
seen
owen
before
although
she
had
heard
of
him
belonged
to
the
church
of
england
and
was
intensely
religious
she
looked
curiously
at
the
atheist
as
he
entered
the
room
he
had
taken
off
his
hat
and
she
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
was
not
repulsive
to
look
at
rather
the
contrary
but
then
she
remembered
that
satan
often
appears
as
an
angel
of
light
appearances
are
deceitful
she
wished
that
john
had
not
asked
him
into
the
house
and
hoped
that
no
evil
consequences
would
follow
as
she
looked
at
him
she
was
horrified
to
perceive
a
small
black
head
with
a
pair
of
glistening
green
eyes
peeping
out
of
the
breast
of
his
coat
and
immediately
afterwards
the
kitten
catching
sight
of
the
cups
and
saucers
on
the
table
began
to
mew
frantically
and
scrambled
suddenly
out
of
its
shelter
inflicting
a
severe
scratch
on
owen
'
s
restraining
hands
as
it
jumped
to
the
floor
it
clambered
up
the
tablecloth
and
began
rushing
all
over
the
table
darting
madly
from
one
plate
to
another
seeking
something
to
eat
the
children
screamed
with
delight
their
grandmother
was
filled
with
a
feeling
of
superstitious
alarm
linden
and
the
young
woman
stood
staring
with
astonishment
at
the
unexpected
visitor
before
the
kitten
had
time
to
do
any
damage
owen
caught
hold
of
it
and
despite
its
struggles
lifted
it
off
the
table
`
i
found
it
in
the
street
as
i
was
coming
along
he
said
`
it
seems
to
be
starving
`
poor
little
thing
i
will
give
it
something
exclaimed
the
young
woman
she
put
some
milk
and
bread
into
a
saucer
for
it
and
the
kitten
ate
ravenously
almost
upsetting
the
saucer
in
its
eagerness
much
to
the
amusement
of
the
two
children
who
stood
by
watching
it
admiringly
their
mother
now
handed
owen
a
cup
of
tea
linden
insisted
on
his
sitting
down
and
then
began
to
talk
about
hunter
`
you
know
i
had
to
spend
some
time
on
them
doors
to
make
'
em
look
anything
at
all
but
it
was
not
the
time
i
took
or
even
the
smoking
what
made
'
im
go
on
like
that
he
knows
very
well
the
time
it
takes
the
real
reason
is
that
he
thinks
i
was
gettin
'
too
much
money
work
is
done
so
rough
nowadays
that
chaps
like
sawkins
is
good
enough
for
most
of
it
hunter
shoved
me
off
just
because
i
was
getting
the
top
money
and
you
will
see
i
wo
not
be
the
only
one
`
i
am
afraid
you
are
right
returned
owen
`
did
you
see
rushton
when
you
went
for
your
money
`
yes
replied
linden
`
i
hurried
up
as
fast
as
i
could
but
hunter
was
there
first
he
passed
me
on
his
bike
before
i
got
half
-
way
so
i
suppose
he
told
his
tale
before
i
came
anyway
when
i
started
to
speak
to
mr
rushton
he
would
not
listen
said
he
could
not
interfere
between
mr
hunter
and
the
men
`
ah
they
are
a
bad
lot
them
two
said
the
old
woman
shaking
her
head
sagely
`
but
it
will
all
come
'
ome
to
'
em
you
will
see
they
will
never
prosper
the
lord
will
punish
them
owen
did
not
feel
very
confident
of
that
most
of
the
people
he
knew
who
had
prospered
were
very
similar
in
character
to
the
two
worthies
in
question
however
he
did
not
want
to
argue
with
this
poor
old
woman
`
when
tom
was
called
up
to
go
to
the
war
said
the
young
woman
bitterly
'
mr
rushton
shook
hands
with
him
and
promised
to
give
him
a
job
when
he
came
back
but
now
that
poor
tom
'
s
gone
and
they
know
that
me
and
the
children
'
s
got
no
one
to
look
to
but
father
they
do
this
although
at
the
mention
of
her
dead
son
'
s
name
old
mrs
linden
was
evidently
distressed
she
was
still
mindful
of
the
atheist
'
s
presence
and
hastened
to
rebuke
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
`
you
should
not
say
we
'
ve
got
no
one
to
look
to
mary
she
said
`
we
are
not
as
them
who
are
without
god
and
without
hope
in
the
world
the
lord
is
our
shepherd
he
careth
for
the
widow
and
the
fatherless
owen
was
very
doubtful
about
this
also
he
had
seen
so
many
badly
cared
-
for
children
about
the
streets
lately
and
what
he
remembered
of
his
own
sorrowful
childhood
was
all
evidence
to
the
contrary
an
awkward
silence
succeeded
owen
did
not
wish
to
continue
this
conversation
he
was
afraid
that
he
might
say
something
that
would
hurt
the
old
woman
besides
he
was
anxious
to
get
away
he
began
to
feel
cold
in
his
wet
clothes
as
he
put
his
empty
cup
on
the
table
he
said
`
well
i
must
be
going
they
will
be
thinking
i
am
lost
at
home
the
kitten
had
finished
all
the
bread
and
milk
and
was
gravely
washing
its
face
with
one
of
its
forepaws
to
the
great
admiration
of
the
two
children
who
were
sitting
on
the
floor
beside
it
it
was
an
artful
-
looking
kitten
all
black
with
a
very
large
head
and
a
very
small
body
it
reminded
owen
of
a
tadpole
`
do
you
like
cats
he
asked
addressing
the
children
`
yes
said
the
boy
`
give
it
to
us
will
you
mister
`
oh
do
leave
it
'
ere
mister
exclaimed
the
little
girl
`
i
will
look
after
it
`
so
will
i
said
the
boy
`
but
have
not
you
one
of
your
own
asked
owen
`
yes
we
'
ve
got
a
big
one
`
well
if
you
have
one
already
and
i
give
you
this
then
you
'
d
have
two
cats
and
i
'
d
have
none
that
would
not
be
fair
would
it
`
well
you
can
'
ave
a
lend
of
our
cat
for
a
little
while
if
you
give
us
this
kitten
said
the
boy
after
a
moment
'
s
thought
`
why
would
you
rather
have
the
kitten
`
because
it
would
play
our
cat
do
not
want
to
play
it
is
too
old
`
perhaps
you
are
too
rough
with
it
returned
owen
`
no
it
ai
not
that
it
is
just
because
it
is
old
`
you
know
cats
is
just
the
same
as
people
explained
the
little
girl
wisely
`
when
they
are
grown
up
i
suppose
they
'
ve
got
their
troubles
to
think
about
owen
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
her
troubles
commenced
as
he
gazed
at
these
two
little
orphans
he
thought
of
his
own
child
and
of
the
rough
and
thorny
way
they
would
all
three
have
to
travel
if
they
were
so
unfortunate
as
to
outlive
their
childhood
`
can
we
'
ave
it
mister
repeated
the
boy
owen
would
have
liked
to
grant
the
children
'
s
request
but
he
wanted
the
kitten
himself
therefore
he
was
relieved
when
their
grandmother
exclaimed
`
we
do
not
want
no
more
cats
'
ere
we
'
ve
got
one
already
that
'
s
quite
enough
she
was
not
yet
quite
satisfied
in
her
mind
that
the
creature
was
not
an
incarnation
of
the
devil
but
whether
it
was
or
not
she
did
not
want
it
or
anything
else
of
owen
'
s
in
this
house
she
wished
he
would
go
and
take
his
kitten
or
his
familiar
or
whatever
it
was
with
him
no
good
could
come
of
his
being
there
was
it
not
written
in
the
word
`
if
any
man
love
not
the
lord
jesus
christ
let
him
be
anathema
maran
-
atha
she
did
not
know
exactly
what
anathema
maran
-
atha
meant
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
something
very
unpleasant
it
was
a
terrible
thing
that
this
blasphemer
who
as
she
had
heard
did
not
believe
there
was
a
hell
and
said
that
the
bible
was
not
the
word
of
god
should
be
here
in
the
house
sitting
on
one
of
their
chairs
drinking
from
one
of
their
cups
and
talking
to
their
children
the
children
stood
by
wistfully
when
owen
put
the
kitten
under
his
coat
and
rose
to
go
away
as
linden
prepared
to
accompany
him
to
the
front
door
owen
happening
to
notice
a
timepiece
standing
on
a
small
table
in
the
recess
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
exclaimed
`
that
'
s
a
very
nice
clock
`
yes
it
is
all
right
ai
not
it
said
old
jack
with
a
touch
of
pride
`
poor
tom
made
that
not
the
clock
itself
but
just
the
case
it
was
the
case
that
had
attracted
owen
'
s
attention
it
stood
about
two
feet
high
and
was
made
of
fretwork
in
the
form
of
an
indian
mosque
with
a
pointed
dome
and
pinnacles
it
was
a
very
beautiful
thing
and
must
have
cost
many
hours
of
patient
labour
`
yes
said
the
old
woman
in
a
trembling
broken
voice
and
looking
at
owen
with
a
pathetic
expression
`
months
and
months
he
worked
at
it
and
no
one
ever
guessed
who
it
were
for
and
then
when
my
birthday
came
round
the
very
first
thing
i
saw
when
i
woke
up
in
the
morning
were
the
clock
standing
on
a
chair
by
the
bed
with
a
card
'
to
dear
mother
from
her
loving
son
tom
wishing
her
many
happy
birthdays
`
but
he
never
had
another
birthday
himself
because
just
five
months
afterwards
he
were
sent
out
to
africa
and
he
'
d
only
been
there
five
weeks
when
he
died
five
years
ago
come
the
fifteenth
of
next
month
owen
inwardly
regretting
that
he
had
unintentionally
broached
so
painful
a
subject
tried
to
think
of
some
suitable
reply
but
had
to
content
himself
with
murmuring
some
words
of
admiration
of
the
work
as
he
wished
her
good
night
the
old
woman
looking
at
him
could
not
help
observing
that
he
appeared
very
frail
and
ill
his
face
was
very
thin
and
pale
and
his
eyes
were
unnaturally
bright
possibly
the
lord
in
his
infinite
loving
kindness
and
mercy
was
chastening
this
unhappy
castaway
in
order
that
he
might
bring
him
to
himself
after
all
he
was
not
altogether
bad
it
was
certainly
very
thoughtful
of
him
to
come
all
this
way
to
let
john
know
about
that
job
she
observed
that
he
had
no
overcoat
and
the
storm
was
still
raging
fiercely
outside
furious
gusts
of
wind
frequently
striking
the
house
and
shaking
it
to
its
very
foundations
the
natural
kindliness
of
her
character
asserted
itself
her
better
feelings
were
aroused
triumphing
momentarily
over
the
bigotry
of
her
religious
opinions
`
why
you
ai
not
got
no
overcoat
she
exclaimed
`
you
will
be
soaked
goin
'
'
ome
in
this
rain
then
turning
to
her
husband
she
continued
`
there
'
s
that
old
one
of
yours
you
might
lend
him
that
it
would
be
better
than
nothing
but
owen
would
not
hear
of
this
he
thought
as
he
became
very
conscious
of
the
clammy
feel
of
his
saturated
clothing
that
he
could
not
get
much
wetter
than
he
already
was
linden
accompanied
him
as
far
as
the
front
door
and
owen
once
more
set
out
on
his
way
homeward
through
the
storm
that
howled
around
like
a
wild
beast
hungry
for
its
prey
owen
and
his
family
occupied
the
top
floor
of
a
house
that
had
once
been
a
large
private
dwelling
but
which
had
been
transformed
into
a
series
of
flats
it
was
situated
in
lord
street
almost
in
the
centre
of
the
town
at
one
time
this
had
been
a
most
aristocratic
locality
but
most
of
the
former
residents
had
migrated
to
the
newer
suburb
at
the
west
of
the
town
notwithstanding
this
fact
lord
street
was
still
a
most
respectable
neighbourhood

inhabitants
generally
being
of
a
very
superior
type

like

other
similar
neighbourhoods
supplied
a
striking
answer
to
those
futile
theorists
who
prate
of
the
equality
of
mankind
for
the
inhabitants
instinctively
formed
themselves
into
groups
the
more
superior
types
drawing
together
separating
themselves
from
the
inferior
and
rising
naturally
to
the
top
while
the
others
gathered
themselves
into
distinct
classes
grading
downwards
or
else
isolated
themselves
altogether
being
refused
admission
to
the
circles
they
desired
to
enter
and
in
their
turn
refusing
to
associate
with
their
inferiors

most
exclusive
set
consisted
of
the
families
of

coal
merchant
the
two
retired

mr
trafaim
whose
superiority
was
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
to
say
nothing
of
his
french
extraction
he
wore
-
in
addition
to
the
top
hat
aforesaid
-
a
frock
coat
and
a
pair
of
lavender
trousers
every
day
the
coal
merchant
and
the
jerry
builders
also
wore
top
hats
lavender
trousers
and
frock
coats
but
only
on
sundays
and
other
special
occasions
the
estate
agent
'
s
clerk
and
the
insurance
agent
though
excluded
from
the
higher
circle
belonged
to
another
select
coterie
from
which
they
excluded
in
their
turn
all
persons
of
inferior
rank
such
as
shop
assistants
or
barbers
the
only
individual
who
was
received
with
equal
cordiality
by
all
ranks
was
the
tallyman
'
s
traveller
but
whatever
differences
existed
amongst
them
regarding
each
other
'
s
social
standing
they
were
unanimous
on
one
point
at
least
they
were
indignant
at
owen
'
s
presumption
in
coming
to
live
in
such
a
refined
locality
this
low
fellow
this
common
workman
with
his
paint
-
bespattered
clothing
his
broken
boots
and
his
generally
shabby
appearance
was
a
disgrace
to
the
street
and
as
for
his
wife
she
was
not
much
better
because
although
whenever
she
came
out
she
was
always
neatly
dressed
yet
most
of
the
neighbours
knew
perfectly
well
that
she
had
been
wearing
the
same
white
straw
hat
all
the
time
she
had
been
there
in
fact
the
only
tolerable
one
of
the
family
was
the
boy
and
they
were
forced
to
admit
that
he
was
always
very
well
dressed
so
well
indeed
as
to
occasion
some
surprise
until
they
found
out
that
all
the
boy
'
s
clothes
were
home
-
made
then
their
surprise
was
changed
into
a
somewhat
grudging
admiration
of
the
skill
displayed
mingled
with
contempt
for
the
poverty
which
made
its
exercise
necessary
the
indignation
of
the
neighbours
was
increased
when
it
became
known
that
owen
and
his
wife
were
not
christians
then
indeed
everyone
agreed
that
the
landlord
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
for
letting
the
top
flat
to
such
people
but
although
the
hearts
of
these
disciples
of
the
meek
and
lowly
jewish
carpenter
were
filled
with
uncharitableness
they
were
powerless
to
do
much
harm
the
landlord
regarded
their
opinion
with
indifference
all
he
cared
about
was
the
money
although
he
also
was
a
sincere
christian
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
let
the
top
flat
to
satan
himself
provided
he
was
certain
of
receiving
the
rent
regularly
the
only
one
upon
whom
the
christians
were
able
to
inflict
any
suffering
was
the
child
at
first
when
he
used
to
go
out
into
the
street
to
play
the
other
children
acting
on
their
parents
'
instructions
refused
to
associate
with
him
or
taunted
him
with
his
parents
'
poverty
occasionally
he
came
home
heartbroken
and
in
tears
because
he
had
been
excluded
from
some
game
at
first
sometimes
the
mothers
of
some
of
the
better
-
class
children
used
to
come
out
with
a
comical
assumption
of
superiority
and
dignity
and
compel
their
children
to
leave
off
playing
with
frankie
and
some
other
poorly
dressed
children
who
used
to
play
in
that
street
these
females
were
usually
overdressed
and
wore
a
lot
of
jewellery
most
of
them
fancied
they
were
ladies
and
if
they
had
only
had
the
sense
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
other
people
might
possibly
have
shared
the
same
delusion
but
this
was
now
a
rare
occurrence
because
the
parents
of
the
other
children
found
it
a
matter
of
considerable
difficulty
to
prevent
their
youngsters
from
associating
with
those
of
inferior
rank
for
when
left
to
themselves
the
children
disregarded
all
such
distinctions
frequently
in
that
street
was
to
be
seen
the
appalling
spectacle
of
the
ten
-
year
-
old
son
of
the
refined
and
fashionable
trafaim
dragging
along
a
cart
constructed
of
a
sugar
box
and
an
old
pair
of
perambulator
wheels
with
no
tyres
in
which
reposed
the
plebeian
frankie
owen
armed
with
a
whip
and
the
dowdy
daughter
of
a
barber
'
s
clerk
while
the
nine
-
year
-
old
heir
of
the
coal
merchant
rushed
up
behind
owen
'
s
wife
and
little
son
were
waiting
for
him
in
the
living
room
this
room
was
about
twelve
feet
square
and
the
ceiling
-
which
was
low
and
irregularly
shaped
showing
in
places
the
formation
of
the
roof
-
had
been
decorated
by
owen
with
painted
ornaments
there
were
three
or
four
chairs
and
an
oblong
table
covered
with
a
clean
white
tablecloth
set
ready
for
tea
in
the
recess
at
the
right
of
fireplace
an
ordinary
open
grate
were
a
number
of
shelves
filled
with
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
books
most
of
which
had
been
bought
second
-
hand
there
were
also
a
number
of
new
books
mostly
cheap
editions
in
paper
covers
over
the
back
of
a
chair
at
one
side
of
the
fire
was
hanging
an
old
suit
of
owen
'
s
and
some
underclothing
which
his
wife
had
placed
there
to
air
knowing
that
he
would
be
wet
through
by
the
time
he
arrived
home
the
woman
was
half
-
sitting
half
lying
on
a
couch
by
the
other
side
of
the
fire
she
was
very
thin
and
her
pale
face
bore
the
traces
of
much
physical
and
mental
suffering
she
was
sewing
a
task
which
her
reclining
position
rendered
somewhat
difficult
although
she
was
really
only
twenty
-
eight
years
of
age
she
appeared
older
the
boy
who
was
sitting
on
the
hearthrug
playing
with
some
toys
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
his
mother
he
also
appeared
very
fragile
and
in
his
childish
face
was
reproduced
much
of
the
delicate
prettiness
which
she
had
once
possessed
his
feminine
appearance
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
his
yellow
hair
hung
in
long
curls
on
his
shoulders
the
pride
with
which
his
mother
regarded
this
long
hair
was
by
no
means
shared
by
frankie
himself
for
he
was
always
entreating
her
to
cut
it
off
presently
the
boy
stood
up
and
walking
gravely
over
to
the
window
looked
down
into
the
street
scanning
the
pavement
for
as
far
as
he
could
see
he
had
been
doing
this
at
intervals
for
the
last
hour
`
i
wonder
wherever
he
is
got
to
he
said
as
he
returned
to
the
fire
`
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
returned
his
mother
`
perhaps
he
is
had
to
work
overtime
`
you
know
i
'
ve
been
thinking
lately
observed
frankie
after
a
pause
`
that
it
is
a
great
mistake
for
dad
to
go
out
working
at
all
i
believe
that
'
s
the
very
reason
why
we
are
so
poor
`
nearly
everyone
who
works
is
more
or
less
poor
dear
but
if
dad
did
not
go
out
to
work
we
'
d
be
even
poorer
than
we
are
now
we
should
have
nothing
to
eat
`
but
dad
says
that
the
people
who
do
nothing
get
lots
of
everything
`
yes
and
it
is
quite
true
that
most
of
the
people
who
never
do
any
work
get
lots
of
everything
but
where
do
they
get
it
from
and
how
do
they
get
it
`
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
replied
frankie
shaking
his
head
in
a
puzzled
fashion
`
supposing
dad
did
not
go
to
work
or
that
he
had
no
work
to
go
to
or
that
he
was
ill
and
not
able
to
do
any
work
then
we
'
d
have
no
money
to
buy
anything
how
should
we
get
on
then
`
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
repeated
frankie
looking
round
the
room
in
a
thoughtful
manner
`
the
chairs
that
'
s
left
are
not
good
enough
to
sell
and
we
ca
not
sell
the
beds
or
your
sofa
but
you
might
pawn
my
velvet
suit
`
but
even
if
all
the
things
were
good
enough
to
sell
the
money
we
'
d
get
for
them
would
not
last
very
long
and
what
should
we
do
then
`
well
i
suppose
we
'
d
have
to
go
without
that
'
s
all
the
same
as
we
did
when
dad
was
in
london
`
but
how
do
the
people
who
never
do
any
work
manage
to
get
lots
of
money
then
added
frankie
`
oh
there
'
s
lots
of
different
ways
for
instance
you
remember
when
dad
was
in
london
and
we
had
no
food
in
the
house
i
had
to
sell
the
easy
chair
frankie
nodded
`
yes
he
said
`
i
remember
you
wrote
a
note
and
i
took
it
to
the
shop
and
afterwards
old
didlum
came
up
here
and
bought
it
and
then
his
cart
came
and
a
man
took
it
away
`
and
do
you
remember
how
much
he
gave
us
for
it
`
five
shillings
replied
frankie
promptly
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
details
of
the
transaction
having
often
heard
his
father
and
mother
discuss
it
`
and
when
we
saw
it
in
his
shop
window
a
little
while
afterwards
what
price
was
marked
on
it
'
fifteen
shillings
well
that
'
s
one
way
of
getting
money
without
working
frankie
played
with
his
toys
in
silence
for
some
minutes
at
last
he
said
`
what
other
ways
`
some
people
who
have
some
money
already
get
more
in
this
way
they
find
some
people
who
have
no
money
and
say
to
them
come
and
work
for
us
then
the
people
who
have
the
money
pay
the
workers
just
enough
wages
to
keep
them
alive
whilst
they
are
at
work
then
when
the
things
that
the
working
people
have
been
making
are
finished
the
workers
are
sent
away
and
as
they
still
have
no
money
they
are
soon
starving
in
the
meantime
the
people
who
had
the
money
take
all
the
things
that
the
workers
have
made
and
sell
them
for
a
great
deal
more
money
than
they
gave
to
the
workers
for
making
them
that
'
s
another
way
of
getting
lots
of
money
without
doing
any
useful
work
`
but
is
there
no
way
to
get
rich
without
doing
such
things
as
that
`
it
is
not
possible
for
anyone
to
become
rich
without
cheating
other
people
`
what
about
our
schoolmaster
then
he
does
not
do
any
work
`
do
not
you
think
it
is
useful
and
and
also
very
hard
work
teaching
all
those
boys
every
day
i
do
not
think
i
should
like
to
have
to
do
it
`
yes
i
suppose
what
he
does
is
some
use
said
frankie
thoughtfully
`
and
it
must
be
rather
hard
too
i
should
think
i
'
ve
noticed
he
looks
a
bit
worried
sometimes
and
sometimes
he
gets
into
a
fine
old
wax
when
the
boys
do
not
pay
proper
attention
the
child
again
went
over
to
the
window
and
pulling
back
the
edge
of
the
blind
looked
down
the
deserted
rain
washed
street
`
what
about
the
vicar
he
remarked
as
he
returned
although
frankie
did
not
go
to
church
or
sunday
school
the
day
school
that
he
had
attended
was
that
attached
to
the
parish
church
and
the
vicar
was
in
the
habit
of
looking
in
occasionally
`
ah
he
really
is
one
of
those
who
live
without
doing
any
necessary
work
and
of
all
the
people
who
do
nothing
the
vicar
is
one
of
the
very
worst
frankie
looked
up
at
his
mother
with
some
surprise
not
because
he
entertained
any
very
high
opinion
of
clergymen
in
general
for
having
been
an
attentive
listener
to
many
conversations
between
his
parents
he
had
of
course
assimilated
their
opinions
as
far
as
his
infant
understanding
permitted
but
because
at
the
school
the
scholars
were
taught
to
regard
the
gentleman
in
question
with
the
most
profound
reverence
and
respect
`
why
mum
he
asked
`
for
this
reason
dearie
you
know
that
all
the
beautiful
things
which
the
people
who
do
nothing
have
are
made
by
the
people
who
work
do
not
you
`
yes
`
and
you
know
that
those
who
work
have
to
eat
the
very
worst
food
and
wear
the
very
worst
clothes
and
live
in
the
very
worst
homes
`
yes
said
frankie
`
and
sometimes
they
have
nothing
to
eat
at
all
and
no
clothes
to
wear
except
rags
and
even
no
homes
to
live
in
`
yes
repeated
the
child
`
well
the
vicar
goes
about
telling
the
idlers
that
it
is
quite
right
for
them
to
do
nothing
and
that
god
meant
them
to
have
nearly
everything
that
is
made
by
those
who
work
in
fact
he
tells
them
that
god
made
the
poor
for
the
use
of
the
rich
then
he
goes
to
the
workers
and
tells
them
that
god
meant
them
to
work
very
hard
and
to
give
all
the
good
things
they
make
to
those
who
do
nothing
and
that
they
should
be
very
thankful
to
god
and
to
the
idlers
for
being
allowed
to
have
even
the
very
worst
food
to
eat
and
the
rags
and
broken
boots
to
wear
he
also
tells
them
that
they
must
not
grumble
or
be
discontented
because
they
are
poor
in
this
world
but
that
they
must
wait
till
they
are
dead
and
then
god
will
reward
them
by
letting
them
go
to
a
place
called
heaven
frankie
laughed
`
and
what
about
the
idlers
he
asked
`
the
vicar
says
that
if
they
believe
everything
he
tells
them
and
give
him
some
of
the
money
they
make
out
of
the
workers
then
god
will
let
them
into
heaven
also
`
well
that
'
s
not
fair
doos
is
it
mum
said
frankie
with
some
indignation
`
it
would
not
be
if
it
were
true
but
then
you
see
it
is
not
true
it
ca
not
be
true
`
why
ca
not
it
mum
`
oh
for
many
reasons
to
begin
with
the
vicar
does
not
believe
it
himself
he
only
pretends
to
for
instance
he
pretends
to
believe
the
bible
but
if
we
read
the
bible
we
find
that
jesus
said
that
god
is
our
father
and
that
all
the
people
in
the
world
are
his
children
all
brothers
and
sisters
but
the
vicar
says
that
although
jesus
said
"
brothers
and
sisters
"
he
really
ought
to
have
said
"
masters
and
servants
"
again
jesus
said
that
his
disciples
should
not
think
of
tomorrow
or
save
up
a
lot
of
money
for
themselves
but
they
should
be
unselfish
and
help
those
who
are
in
need
jesus
said
that
his
disciples
must
not
think
about
their
own
future
needs
at
all
because
god
will
provide
for
them
if
they
only
do
as
he
commands
but
the
vicar
says
that
is
all
nonsense
`
jesus
also
said
that
if
anyone
tried
to
do
his
disciples
harm
they
must
never
resist
but
forgive
those
who
injured
them
and
pray
god
to
forgive
them
also
but
the
vicar
says
this
is
all
nonsense
too
he
says
that
the
world
would
never
be
able
to
go
on
if
we
did
as
jesus
taught
the
vicar
teaches
that
the
way
to
deal
with
those
that
injure
us
is
to
have
them
put
into
prison
or
-
if
they
belong
to
some
other
country
-
to
take
guns
and
knives
and
murder
them
and
burn
their
houses
so
you
see
the
vicar
does
not
really
believe
or
do
any
of
the
things
that
jesus
said
he
only
pretends
`
but
why
does
he
pretend
and
go
about
talking
like
that
mum
what
does
he
do
it
for
`
because
he
wishes
to
live
without
working
himself
dear
`
and
do
not
the
people
know
he
is
only
pretending
`
some
of
them
do
most
of
the
idlers
know
that
what
the
vicar
says
is
not
true
but
they
pretend
to
believe
it
and
give
him
money
for
saying
it
because
they
want
him
to
go
on
telling
it
to
the
workers
so
that
they
will
go
on
working
and
keep
quiet
and
be
afraid
to
think
for
themselves
`
and
what
about
the
workers
do
they
believe
it
`
most
of
them
do
because
when
they
were
little
children
like
you
their
mothers
taught
them
to
believe
without
thinking
whatever
the
vicar
said
and
that
god
made
them
for
the
use
of
the
idlers
when
they
went
to
school
they
were
taught
the
same
thing
and
now
that
they
are
grown
up
they
really
believe
it
and
they
go
to
work
and
give
nearly
everything
they
make
to
the
idlers
and
have
next
to
nothing
left
for
themselves
and
their
children
that
'
s
the
reason
why
the
workers
'
children
have
very
bad
clothes
to
wear
and
sometimes
no
food
to
eat
and
that
'
s
how
it
is
that
the
idlers
and
their
children
have
more
clothes
than
they
need
and
more
food
than
they
can
eat
some
of
them
have
so
much
food
that
they
are
not
able
to
eat
it
they
just
waste
it
or
throw
it
away
`
when
i
am
grown
up
into
a
man
said
frankie
with
a
flushed
face
`
i
am
going
to
be
one
of
the
workers
and
when
we
'
ve
made
a
lot
of
things
i
shall
stand
up
and
tell
the
others
what
to
do
if
any
of
the
idlers
come
to
take
our
things
away
they
will
get
something
they
wo
not
like
in
a
state
of
suppressed
excitement
and
scarcely
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
the
boy
began
gathering
up
the
toys
and
throwing
the
violently
one
by
one
into
the
box
`
i
will
teach
'
em
to
come
taking
our
things
away
he
exclaimed
relapsing
momentarily
into
his
street
style
of
speaking
`
first
of
all
we
will
all
stand
quietly
on
one
side
then
when
the
idlers
come
in
and
start
touching
our
things
we
will
go
up
to
'
em
and
say
ere
watcher
doin
'
of
just
you
put
it
down
will
yer
and
if
they
do
not
put
it
down
at
once
it
will
be
the
worse
for
'
em
i
can
tell
you
all
the
toys
being
collected
frankie
picked
up
the
box
and
placed
it
noisily
in
its
accustomed
corner
of
the
room
`
i
should
think
the
workers
will
be
jolly
glad
when
they
see
me
coming
to
tell
them
what
to
do
should
not
you
mum
`
i
do
not
know
dear
you
see
so
many
people
have
tried
to
tell
them
but
they
wo
not
listen
they
do
not
want
to
hear
they
think
it
is
quite
right
that
they
should
work
very
hard
all
their
lives
and
quite
right
that
most
of
the
things
they
help
to
make
should
be
taken
away
from
them
by
the
people
who
do
nothing
the
workers
think
that
their
children
are
not
as
good
as
the
children
of
the
idlers
and
they
teach
their
children
that
as
soon
as
ever
they
are
old
enough
they
must
be
satisfied
to
work
very
hard
and
to
have
only
very
bad
good
and
clothes
and
homes
`
then
i
should
think
the
workers
ought
to
be
jolly
ashamed
of
themselves
mum
do
not
you
`
well
in
one
sense
they
ought
but
you
must
remember
that
that
'
s
what
they
'
ve
always
been
taught
themselves
first
their
mothers
and
fathers
told
them
so
then
their
schoolteachers
told
them
so
and
then
when
they
went
to
church
the
vicar
and
the
sunday
school
teacher
told
them
the
same
thing
so
you
ca
not
be
surprised
that
they
now
really
believe
that
god
made
them
and
their
children
to
make
things
for
the
use
of
the
people
who
do
nothing
`
but
you
'
d
think
their
own
sense
would
tell
them
how
can
it
be
right
for
the
people
who
do
nothing
to
have
the
very
best
and
most
of
everything
thats
made
and
the
very
ones
who
make
everything
to
have
hardly
any
why
even
i
know
better
than
that
and
i
am
only
six
and
a
half
years
old
`
but
then
you
are
different
dearie
you
'
ve
been
taught
to
think
about
it
and
dad
and
i
have
explained
it
to
you
often
`
yes
i
know
replied
frankie
confidently
`
but
even
if
you
'
d
never
taught
me
i
am
sure
i
should
have
tumbled
to
it
all
right
by
myself
i
am
not
such
a
juggins
as
you
think
i
am
`
so
you
might
but
you
would
not
if
you
'
d
been
brought
up
in
the
same
way
as
most
of
the
workers
they
'
ve
been
taught
that
it
is
very
wicked
to
use
their
own
judgement
or
to
think
and
their
children
are
being
taught
so
now
do
you
remember
what
you
told
me
the
other
day
when
you
came
home
from
school
about
the
scripture
lesson
`
about
st
thomas
`
yes
what
did
the
teacher
say
st
thomas
was
`
she
said
he
was
a
bad
example
and
she
said
i
was
worse
than
him
because
i
asked
too
many
foolish
questions
she
always
gets
in
a
wax
if
i
talk
too
much
`
well
why
did
she
call
st
thomas
a
bad
example
`
because
he
would
not
believe
what
he
was
told
`
exactly
well
when
you
told
dad
about
it
what
did
he
say
`
dad
told
me
that
really
st
thomas
was
the
only
sensible
man
in
the
whole
crowd
of
apostles
that
is
added
frankie
correcting
himself
`
if
there
ever
was
such
a
man
at
all
`
but
did
dad
say
that
there
never
was
such
a
man
`
no
he
said
he
did
not
believe
there
ever
was
but
he
told
me
to
just
listen
to
what
the
teacher
said
about
such
things
and
then
to
think
about
it
in
my
own
mind
and
wait
till
i
am
grown
up
and
then
i
can
use
my
own
judgement
`
well
now
that
'
s
what
you
were
told
but
all
the
other
children
'
s
mothers
and
fathers
tell
them
to
believe
without
thinking
whatever
the
teacher
says
so
it
will
be
no
wonder
if
those
children
are
not
able
to
think
for
themselves
when
they
are
grown
up
will
it
`
do
not
you
think
it
will
be
any
use
then
for
me
to
tell
them
what
to
do
to
the
idlers
asked
frankie
dejectedly
`
hark
said
his
mother
holding
up
her
finger
`
dad
cried
frankie
rushing
to
the
door
and
flinging
it
open
he
ran
along
the
passage
and
opened
the
staircase
door
before
owen
reached
the
top
of
the
last
flight
of
stairs
`
why
ever
do
you
come
up
at
such
a
rate
reproachfully
exclaimed
owen
'
s
wife
as
he
came
into
the
room
exhausted
from
the
climb
upstairs
and
sank
panting
into
the
nearest
chair
`
i
al
-
ways
-
for
-
get
he
replied
when
he
had
in
some
degree
recovered
as
he
lay
back
in
the
chair
his
face
haggard
and
of
a
ghastly
whiteness
and
with
the
water
dripping
from
his
saturated
clothing
owen
presented
a
terrible
appearance
frankie
noticed
with
childish
terror
the
extreme
alarm
with
which
his
mother
looked
at
his
father
`
you
are
always
doing
it
he
said
with
a
whimper
`
how
many
more
times
will
mother
have
to
tell
you
about
it
before
you
take
nay
notice
`
it
is
all
right
old
chap
said
owen
drawing
the
child
nearer
to
him
and
kissing
the
curly
head
`
listen
and
see
if
you
can
guess
what
i
'
ve
got
for
you
under
my
coat
in
the
silence
the
purring
of
the
kitten
was
distinctly
audible
`
a
kitten
cried
the
boy
taking
it
out
of
its
hiding
-
place
`
all
black
and
i
believe
it
is
half
a
persian
just
the
very
thing
i
wanted
while
frankie
amused
himself
playing
with
the
kitten
which
had
been
provided
with
another
saucer
of
bread
and
milk
owen
went
into
the
bedroom
to
put
on
the
dry
clothes
and
then
those
that
he
had
taken
off
having
been
placed
with
his
boots
near
the
fire
to
dry
he
explained
as
they
were
taking
tea
the
reason
of
his
late
homecoming
`
i
am
afraid
he
wo
not
find
it
very
easy
to
get
another
job
he
remarked
referring
to
linden
`
even
in
the
summer
nobody
will
be
inclined
to
take
him
on
he
is
too
old
`
it
is
a
dreadful
prospect
for
the
two
children
answered
his
wife
`
yes
replied
owen
bitterly
`
it
is
the
children
who
will
suffer
most
as
for
linden
and
his
wife
although
of
course
one
ca
not
help
feeling
sorry
for
them
at
the
same
time
there
'
s
no
getting
away
from
the
fact
that
they
deserve
to
suffer
all
their
lives
they
'
ve
been
working
like
brutes
and
living
in
poverty
although
they
have
done
more
than
their
fair
share
of
the
work
they
have
never
enjoyed
anything
like
a
fair
share
of
the
things
they
have
helped
to
produce
and
yet
all
their
lives
they
have
supported
and
defended
the
system
that
robbed
them
and
have
resisted
and
ridiculed
every
proposal
to
alter
it
it
is
wrong
to
feel
sorry
for
such
people
they
deserve
to
suffer
after
tea
as
he
watched
his
wife
clearing
away
the
tea
things
and
rearranging
the
drying
clothing
by
the
fire
owen
for
the
first
time
noticed
that
she
looked
unusually
ill
`
you
do
not
look
well
tonight
nora
he
said
crossing
over
to
her
and
putting
his
arm
around
her
`
i
do
not
feel
well
she
replied
resting
her
head
wearily
against
his
shoulder
`
i
'
ve
been
very
bad
all
day
and
i
had
to
lie
down
nearly
all
the
afternoon
i
do
not
know
how
i
should
have
managed
to
get
the
tea
ready
if
it
had
not
been
for
frankie
`
i
set
the
table
for
you
did
not
i
mum
said
frankie
with
pride
`
and
tidied
up
the
room
as
well
`
yes
darling
you
helped
me
a
lot
she
answered
and
frankie
went
over
to
her
and
kissed
her
hand
`
well
you
'
d
better
go
to
bed
at
once
said
owen
`
i
can
put
frankie
to
bed
presently
and
do
whatever
else
is
necessary
`
but
there
are
so
many
things
to
attend
to
i
want
to
see
that
your
clothes
are
properly
dry
and
to
put
something
ready
for
you
to
take
in
the
morning
before
you
go
out
and
then
there
'
s
your
breakfast
to
pack
up
-
'
`
i
can
manage
all
that
`
i
did
not
want
to
give
way
to
it
like
this
the
woman
said
`
because
i
know
you
must
be
tired
out
yourself
but
i
really
do
feel
quite
done
up
now
`
oh
i
am
all
right
replied
owen
who
was
really
so
fatigued
that
he
was
scarcely
able
to
stand
`
i
will
go
and
draw
the
blinds
down
and
light
the
other
lamp
so
say
good
night
to
frankie
and
come
at
once
`
i
wo
not
say
good
night
properly
now
mum
remarked
the
boy
`
because
dad
can
carry
me
into
your
room
before
he
puts
me
into
bed
a
little
later
as
owen
was
undressing
frankie
the
latter
remarked
as
he
looked
affectionately
at
the
kitten
which
was
sitting
on
the
hearthrug
watching
the
child
'
s
every
movement
under
the
impression
that
it
was
part
of
some
game
`
what
name
do
you
think
we
ought
to
call
it
dad
`
you
may
give
him
any
name
you
like
replied
owen
absently
`
i
know
a
dog
that
lives
down
the
road
said
the
boy
`
his
name
is
major
how
would
that
do
or
we
might
call
him
sergeant
the
kitten
observing
that
he
was
the
subject
of
their
conversation
purred
loudly
and
winked
as
if
to
intimate
that
he
did
not
care
what
rank
was
conferred
upon
him
so
long
as
the
commisariat
department
was
properly
attended
to
`
i
do
not
know
though
continued
frankie
thoughtfully
`
they
are
all
right
names
for
dogs
but
i
think
they
are
too
big
for
a
kitten
do
not
you
dad
`
yes
p
'
raps
they
are
said
owen
`
most
cats
are
called
tom
or
kitty
but
i
do
not
want
a
common
name
for
him
`
well
ca
not
you
call
him
after
someone
you
know
`
i
know
i
will
call
him
after
a
little
girl
that
comes
to
our
school
a
fine
name
maud
that
will
be
a
good
one
wo
not
it
dad
`
yes
said
owen
`
i
say
dad
said
frankie
suddenly
realizing
the
awful
fact
that
he
was
being
put
to
bed
`
you
are
forgetting
all
about
my
story
and
you
promised
that
you
'
d
have
a
game
of
trains
with
me
tonight
`
i
had
not
forgotten
but
i
was
hoping
that
you
had
because
i
am
very
tired
and
it
is
very
late
long
past
your
usual
bedtime
you
know
you
can
take
the
kitten
to
bed
with
you
tonight
and
i
will
tell
you
two
stories
tomorrow
because
it
is
saturday
`
all
right
then
said
the
boy
contentedly
`
and
i
will
get
the
railway
station
built
and
i
will
have
the
lines
chalked
on
the
floor
and
the
signals
put
up
before
you
come
home
so
that
there
will
be
no
time
wasted
and
i
will
put
one
chair
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
another
chair
at
the
other
end
and
tie
some
string
across
for
telegraph
wires
that
will
be
a
very
good
idea
wo
not
it
dad
and
owen
agreed
`
but
of
course
i
will
come
to
meet
you
just
the
same
as
other
saturdays
because
i
am
going
to
buy
a
ha
'
porth
of
milk
for
the
kitten
out
of
my
penny
after
the
child
was
in
bed
owen
sat
alone
by
the
table
in
the
draughty
sitting
-
room
thinking
although
there
was
a
bright
fire
the
room
was
very
cold
being
so
close
to
the
roof
the
wind
roared
loudly
round
the
gables
shaking
the
house
in
a
way
that
threatened
every
moment
to
hurl
it
to
the
ground
the
lamp
on
the
table
had
a
green
glass
reservoir
which
was
half
full
of
oil
owen
watched
this
with
unconscious
fascination
every
time
a
gust
of
wind
struck
the
house
the
oil
in
the
lamp
was
agitated
and
rippled
against
the
glass
like
the
waves
of
a
miniature
sea
staring
abstractedly
at
the
lamp
he
thought
of
the
future
a
few
years
ago
the
future
had
seemed
a
region
of
wonderful
and
mysterious
possibilities
of
good
but
tonight
the
thought
brought
no
such
illusions
for
he
knew
that
the
story
of
the
future
was
to
be
much
the
same
as
the
story
of
the
past
the
story
of
the
past
would
continue
to
repeat
itself
for
a
few
years
longer
he
would
continue
to
work
and
they
would
all
three
continue
to
do
without
most
of
the
necessaries
of
life
when
there
was
no
work
they
would
starve
for
himself
he
did
not
care
much
because
he
knew
that
at
the
best
-
or
worst
-
it
would
only
be
a
very
few
years
even
if
he
were
to
have
proper
food
and
clothing
and
be
able
to
take
reasonable
care
of
himself
he
could
not
live
much
longer
but
when
that
time
came
what
was
to
become
of
them
there
would
be
some
hope
for
the
boy
if
he
were
more
robust
and
if
his
character
were
less
gentle
and
more
selfish
under
the
present
system
it
was
impossible
for
anyone
to
succeed
in
life
without
injuring
other
people
and
treating
them
and
making
use
of
them
as
one
would
not
like
to
be
treated
and
made
use
of
oneself
in
order
to
succeed
in
the
world
it
was
necessary
to
be
brutal
selfish
and
unfeeling
to
push
others
aside
and
to
take
advantage
of
their
misfortunes
to
undersell
and
crush
out
one
'
s
competitors
by
fair
means
or
foul
to
consider
one
'
s
own
interests
first
in
every
case
absolutely
regardless
of
the
wellbeing
of
others
that
was
the
ideal
character
owen
knew
that
frankie
'
s
character
did
not
come
up
to
this
lofty
ideal
then
there
was
nora
how
would
she
fare
owen
stood
up
and
began
walking
about
the
room
oppressed
with
a
kind
of
terror
presently
he
returned
to
the
fire
and
began
rearranging
the
clothes
that
were
drying
he
found
that
the
boots
having
been
placed
too
near
the
fire
had
dried
too
quickly
and
consequently
the
sole
of
one
of
them
had
begun
to
split
away
from
the
upper
he
remedied
this
as
well
as
he
was
able
and
then
turned
the
wetter
parts
of
the
clothing
to
the
fire
whilst
doing
this
he
noticed
the
newspaper
which
he
had
forgotten
in
the
coat
pocket
he
drew
it
out
with
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
here
was
something
to
distract
his
thoughts
if
not
instructive
or
comforting
it
would
at
any
rate
be
interesting
and
even
amusing
to
read
the
reports
of
the
self
-
satisfied
futile
talk
of
the
profound
statesmen
who
with
comical
gravity
presided
over
the
working
of
the
great
system
which
their
combined
wisdom
pronounced
to
be
the
best
that
could
possibly
be
devised
but
tonight
owen
was
not
to
read
of
those
things
for
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
paper
his
attention
was
riveted
by
the
staring
headline
of
one
of
the
principal
columns
terrible
domestic
tragedy
wife
and
two
children
killed
suicide
of
the
murderer
it
was
one
of
the
ordinary
poverty
crimes
the
man
had
been
without
employment
for
many
weeks
and
they
had
been
living
by
pawning
or
selling
their
furniture
and
other
possessions
but
even
this
resource
must
have
failed
at
last
and
when
one
day
the
neighbours
noticed
that
the
blinds
remained
down
and
that
there
was
a
strange
silence
about
the
house
no
one
coming
out
or
going
in
suspicions
that
something
was
wrong
were
quickly
aroused
when
the
police
entered
the
house
they
found
in
one
of
the
upper
rooms
the
dead
bodies
of
the
woman
and
the
two
children
with
their
throats
severed
laid
out
side
by
side
upon
the
bed
which
was
saturated
with
their
blood
there
was
no
bedstead
and
no
furniture
in
the
room
except
the
straw
mattress
and
the
ragged
clothes
and
blankets
which
formed
the
bed
upon
the
floor
the
man
'
s
body
was
found
in
the
kitchen
lying
with
outstretched
arms
face
downwards
on
the
floor
surrounded
by
the
blood
that
had
poured
from
the
wound
in
his
throat
which
had
evidently
been
inflicted
by
the
razor
that
was
grasped
in
his
right
hand
no
particle
of
food
was
found
in
the
house
and
on
a
nail
in
the
wall
in
the
kitchen
was
hung
a
piece
of
blood
-
smeared
paper
on
which
was
written
in
pencil
`
this
is
not
my
crime
but
society
'
s
the
report
went
on
to
explain
that
the
deed
must
have
been
perpetrated
during
a
fit
of
temporary
insanity
brought
on
by
the
sufferings
the
man
had
endured
`
insanity
muttered
owen
as
he
read
this
glib
theory
`
insanity
it
seems
to
me
that
he
would
have
been
insane
if
he
had
not
killed
them
surely
it
was
wiser
and
better
and
kinder
to
send
them
all
to
sleep
than
to
let
them
continue
to
suffer
at
the
same
time
he
thought
it
very
strange
that
the
man
should
have
chosen
to
do
it
that
way
when
there
were
so
many
other
cleaner
easier
and
more
painless
ways
of
accomplishing
the
same
object
he
wondered
why
it
was
that
most
of
these
killings
were
done
in
more
or
less
the
same
crude
cruel
messy
way
no
he
would
set
about
it
in
a
different
fashion
he
would
get
some
charcoal
then
he
would
paste
strips
of
paper
over
the
joinings
of
the
door
and
windows
of
the
room
and
close
the
register
of
the
grate
then
he
would
kindle
the
charcoal
on
a
tray
or
something
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
then
they
would
all
three
just
lie
down
together
and
sleep
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
everything
there
would
be
no
pain
no
blood
and
no
mess
or
one
could
take
poison
of
course
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
difficulty
in
procuring
it
but
it
would
not
be
impossible
to
find
some
pretext
for
buying
some
laudanum
one
could
buy
several
small
quantities
at
different
shops
until
one
had
sufficient
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
read
somewhere
that
vermillion
one
of
the
colours
he
frequently
had
to
use
in
his
work
was
one
of
the
most
deadly
poisons
and
there
was
some
other
stuff
that
photographers
used
which
was
very
easy
to
procure
of
course
one
would
have
to
be
very
careful
about
poisons
so
as
not
to
select
one
that
would
cause
a
lot
of
pain
it
would
be
necessary
to
find
out
exactly
how
the
stuff
acted
before
using
it
it
would
not
be
very
difficult
to
do
so
then
he
remembered
that
among
his
books
was
one
that
probably
contained
some
information
about
this
subject
he
went
over
to
the
book
-
shelf
and
presently
found
the
volume
it
was
called
the
cyclopedia
of
practical
medicine
rather
an
old
book
a
little
out
of
date
perhaps
but
still
it
might
contain
the
information
he
wanted
opening
it
he
turned
to
the
table
of
contents
many
different
subjects
were
mentioned
there
and
presently
he
found
the
one
he
sought
poisons
chemically
physiologically
and
pathologically
considered
corrosive
poisons
narcotic
poisons
slow
poisons
consecutive
poisons
accumulative
poisons
he
turned
to
the
chapter
indicated
and
reading
it
he
was
astonished
to
find
what
a
number
of
poisons
there
were
within
easy
reach
of
whoever
wished
to
make
use
of
them
poisons
that
could
be
relied
upon
to
do
their
work
certainly
quickly
and
without
pain
why
it
was
not
even
necessary
to
buy
them
one
could
gather
them
from
the
hedges
by
the
road
side
and
in
the
fields
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
stranger
it
seemed
that
such
a
clumsy
method
as
a
razor
should
be
so
popular
why
almost
any
other
way
would
be
better
and
easier
than
that
strangulation
or
even
hanging
though
the
latter
method
could
scarcely
be
adopted
in
that
house
because
there
were
no
beams
or
rafters
or
anything
from
which
it
would
be
possible
to
suspend
a
cord
still
he
could
drive
some
large
nails
or
hooks
into
one
of
the
walls
for
that
matter
there
were
already
some
clothes
-
hooks
on
some
of
the
doors
he
began
to
think
that
this
would
be
an
even
more
excellent
way
than
poison
or
charcoal
he
could
easily
pretend
to
frankie
that
he
was
going
to
show
him
some
new
kind
of
play
he
could
arrange
the
cord
on
the
hook
on
one
of
the
doors
and
then
under
pretence
of
play
it
would
be
done
the
boy
would
offer
no
resistance
and
in
a
few
minutes
it
would
all
be
over
he
threw
down
the
book
and
pressed
his
hands
over
his
ears
he
fancied
he
could
hear
the
boy
'
s
hands
and
feet
beating
against
the
panels
of
the
door
as
he
struggled
in
his
death
agony
then
as
his
arms
fell
nervelessly
by
his
side
again
he
thought
that
he
heard
frankie
'
s
voice
calling
`
dad
dad
owen
hastily
opened
the
door
`
are
you
calling
frankie
`
yes
i
'
ve
been
calling
you
quite
a
long
time
`
what
do
you
want
`
i
want
you
to
come
here
i
want
to
tell
you
something
`
well
what
is
it
dear
i
thought
you
were
asleep
a
long
time
ago
said
owen
as
he
came
into
the
room
`
that
'
s
just
what
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
the
kitten
'
s
gone
to
sleep
all
right
but
i
ca
not
go
i
'
ve
tried
all
different
ways
counting
and
all
but
it
is
no
use
so
i
thought
i
'
d
ask
you
if
you
'
d
mind
coming
and
staying
with
me
and
letting
me
hold
you
hand
for
a
little
while
and
the
p
'
raps
i
could
go
the
boy
twined
his
arms
round
owen
'
s
neck
and
hugged
him
very
tightly
`
oh
dad
i
love
you
so
much
he
said
`
i
love
you
so
much
i
could
squeeze
you
to
death
`
i
am
afraid
you
will
if
you
squeeze
me
so
tightly
as
that
the
boy
laughed
softly
as
he
relaxed
his
hold
`
that
would
be
a
funny
way
of
showing
you
how
much
i
love
you
would
not
it
dad
squeezing
you
to
death
`
yes
i
suppose
it
would
replied
owen
huskily
as
he
tucked
the
bedclothes
round
the
child
'
s
shoulders
`
but
do
not
talk
any
more
dear
just
hold
my
hand
and
try
to
sleep
`
all
right
said
frankie
lying
there
very
quietly
holding
his
father
'
s
hand
and
occasionally
kissing
it
the
child
presently
fell
asleep
then
owen
got
up
very
gently
and
having
taken
the
kitten
out
of
the
bed
again
and
arranged
the
bedclothes
he
softly
kissed
the
boy
'
s
forehead
and
returned
to
the
other
room
looking
about
for
a
suitable
place
for
the
kitten
to
sleep
in
he
noticed
frankie
'
s
toy
box
and
having
emptied
the
toys
on
to
the
floor
in
a
corner
of
the
room
he
made
a
bed
in
the
box
with
some
rags
and
placed
it
on
its
side
on
the
hearthrug
facing
the
fire
and
with
some
difficulty
persuaded
the
kitten
to
lie
in
it
then
having
placed
the
chairs
on
which
his
clothes
were
drying
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
fire
he
went
into
the
bedroom
nora
was
still
awake
`
are
you
feeling
any
better
dear
he
said
`
yes
i
am
ever
so
much
better
since
i
'
ve
been
in
bed
but
i
ca
not
help
worrying
about
your
clothes
i
am
afraid
they
will
never
be
dry
enough
for
you
to
put
on
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
could
not
you
stay
at
home
till
after
breakfast
just
for
once
`
no
i
must
not
do
that
if
i
did
hunter
would
probably
tell
me
to
stay
away
altogether
i
believe
he
would
be
glad
of
an
excuse
to
get
rid
of
another
full
-
price
man
just
now
`
but
if
it
is
raining
like
this
in
the
morning
you
will
be
wet
through
before
you
get
there
`
it
is
no
good
worrying
about
that
dear
besides
i
can
wear
this
old
coat
that
i
have
no
now
over
the
other
`
and
if
you
wrap
your
old
shoes
in
some
paper
and
take
them
with
you
you
can
take
off
your
wet
boots
as
soon
as
you
get
to
the
place
`
yes
all
right
responded
owen
`
besides
he
added
reassuringly
`
even
if
i
do
get
a
little
wet
we
always
have
a
fire
there
you
know
`
well
i
hope
the
weather
will
be
a
little
better
than
this
in
the
morning
said
nora
`
is
not
it
a
dreadful
night
i
keep
feeling
afraid
that
the
house
is
going
to
be
blown
down
long
after
nora

owen

listening
to

after

one
monday
morning
as
they
were
getting
ready
to

it
was
still
dark
outside
but
the
scullery
was
dimly
illuminated
by
the
flickering
light
of
two
candles
which
crass
had
lighted
and
stuck
on
the
shelf
over
the
fireplace
in
order
to
enable

to

out

on

growled
the
more
easily
satisfied
easton
extraordinary
as
it
may
appear
none
of
them
took
any
pride
in
their
work
they
did
not

love
'
it
they
had
no
conception
of
that
lofty
ideal
of
`
work
for
work

which
is
so
popular
with
the
people
who
do
nothing
on
the
contrary
when

workers
arrived
in

morning

after
breakfast
they

on

after

year
after
year
wishing
their
time
was
over
and
without
realizing
it
really
wishing
that
they
were
dead
how
extraordinary
this
must
appear
to
those
idealists
who
believe
in
`
work
for
work

who
themselves
do
nothing

devour
