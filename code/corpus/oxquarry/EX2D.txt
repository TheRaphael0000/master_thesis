still
,
the
remark
was
sufficient
to
withdraw
jude
'
s
attention
from
the
imaginative
world
he
had
lately
inhabited
,
in
which
an
abstract
figure
,
more
or
less
himself
,
was
steeping
his
mind
in
a
sublimation
of
the
arts
and
sciences
,
and
making
his
calling
and
election
sure
to
a
seat
in
the
paradise
of
the
learned
.
he
was
set
regarding
his
prospects
in
a
cold
northern
light
.
he
had
lately
felt
that
he
could
not
quite
satisfy
himself
in
his
greek
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
the
greek
of
the
dramatists
particularly
.
so
fatigued
was
he
sometimes
after
his
day
'
s
work
that
he
could
not
maintain
the
critical
attention
necessary
for
thorough
application
.
he
felt
that
he
wanted
a
coach
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
friend
at
his
elbow
to
tell
him
in
a
moment
what
sometimes
would
occupy
him
a
weary
month
in
extracting
from
unanticipative
,
clumsy
books
.
it
was
decidedly
necessary
to
consider
facts
a
little
more
closely
than
he
had
done
of
late
.
what
was
the
good
,
after
all
,
of
using
up
his
spare
hours
in
a
vague
labour
called
"
private
study
"
without
giving
an
outlook
on
practicabilities
?
"
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
this
before
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
journeyed
back
.
"
it
would
have
been
better
never
to
have
embarked
in
the
scheme
at
all
than
to
do
it
without
seeing
clearly
where
i
am
going
,
or
what
i
am
aiming
at
.
.
.
.
this
hovering
outside
the
walls
of
the
colleges
,
as
if
expecting
some
arm
to
be
stretched
out
from
them
to
lift
me
inside
,
wo
not
do
!
i
must
get
special
information
.
"
the
next
week
accordingly
he
sought
it
.
what
at
first
seemed
an
opportunity
occurred
one
afternoon
when
he
saw
an
elderly
gentleman
,
who
had
been
pointed
out
as
the
head
of
a
particular
college
,
walking
in
the
public
path
of
a
parklike
enclosure
near
the
spot
at
which
jude
chanced
to
be
sitting
.
the
gentleman
came
nearer
,
and
jude
looked
anxiously
at
his
face
.
it
seemed
benign
,
considerate
,
yet
rather
reserved
.
on
second
thoughts
jude
felt
that
he
could
not
go
up
and
address
him
;
but
he
was
sufficiently
influenced
by
the
incident
to
think
what
a
wise
thing
it
would
be
for
him
to
state
his
difficulties
by
letter
to
some
of
the
best
and
most
judicious
of
these
old
masters
,
and
obtain
their
advice
.
during
the
next
week
or
two
he
accordingly
placed
himself
in
such
positions
about
the
city
as
would
afford
him
glimpses
of
several
of
the
most
distinguished
among
the
provosts
,
wardens
,
and
other
heads
of
houses
;
and
from
those
he
ultimately
selected
five
whose
physiognomies
seemed
to
say
to
him
that
they
were
appreciative
and
far
-
seeing
men
.
to
these
five
he
addressed
letters
,
briefly
stating
his
difficulties
,
and
asking
their
opinion
on
his
stranded
situation
.
when
the
letters
were
posted
jude
mentally
began
to
criticize
them
;
he
wished
they
had
not
been
sent
.
"
it
is
just
one
of
those
intrusive
,
vulgar
,
pushing
,
applications
which
are
so
common
in
these
days
,
"
he
thought
.
"
why
could
not
i
know
better
than
address
utter
strangers
in
such
a
way
?
i
may
be
an
impostor
,
and
idle
scamp
,
a
man
with
a
bad
character
,
for
all
that
they
know
to
the
contrary
.
.
.
.
perhaps
that
'
s
what
i
am
!
"
nevertheless
,
he
found
himself
clinging
to
the
hope
of
some
reply
as
to
his
one
last
chance
of
redemption
.
he
waited
day
after
day
,
saying
that
it
was
perfectly
absurd
to
expect
,
yet
expecting
.
while
he
waited
he
was
suddenly
stirred
by
news
about
phillotson
.
phillotson
was
giving
up
the
school
near
christminster
,
for
a
larger
one
further
south
,
in
mid
-
wessex
.
what
this
meant
;
how
it
would
affect
his
cousin
;
whether
,
as
seemed
possible
,
it
was
a
practical
move
of
the
schoolmaster
'
s
towards
a
larger
income
,
in
view
of
a
provision
for
two
instead
of
one
,
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
say
.
and
the
tender
relations
between
phillotson
and
the
young
girl
of
whom
jude
was
passionately
enamoured
effectually
made
it
repugnant
to
jude
'
s
tastes
to
apply
to
phillotson
for
advice
on
his
own
scheme
.
meanwhile
the
academic
dignitaries
to
whom
jude
had
written
vouchsafed
no
answer
,
and
the
young
man
was
thus
thrown
back
entirely
on
himself
,
as
formerly
,
with
the
added
gloom
of
a
weakened
hope
.
by
indirect
inquiries
he
soon
perceived
clearly
what
he
had
long
uneasily
suspected
,
that
to
qualify
himself
for
certain
open
scholarships
and
exhibitions
was
the
only
brilliant
course
.
but
to
do
this
a
good
deal
of
coaching
would
be
necessary
,
and
much
natural
ability
.
it
was
next
to
impossible
that
a
man
reading
on
his
own
system
,
however
widely
and
thoroughly
,
even
over
the
prolonged
period
of
ten
years
,
should
be
able
to
compete
with
those
who
had
passed
their
lives
under
trained
teachers
and
had
worked
to
ordained
lines
.
the
other
course
,
that
of
buying
himself
in
,
so
to
speak
,
seemed
the
only
one
really
open
to
men
like
him
,
the
difficulty
being
simply
of
a
material
kind
.
with
the
help
of
his
information
he
began
to
reckon
the
extent
of
this
material
obstacle
,
and
ascertained
,
to
his
dismay
,
that
,
at
the
rate
at
which
,
with
the
best
of
fortune
,
he
would
be
able
to
save
money
,
fifteen
years
must
elapse
before
he
could
be
in
a
position
to
forward
testimonials
to
the
head
of
a
college
and
advance
to
a
matriculation
examination
.
the
undertaking
was
hopeless
.
he
saw
what
a
curious
and
cunning
glamour
the
neighbourhood
of
the
place
had
exercised
over
him
.
to
get
there
and
live
there
,
to
move
among
the
churches
and
halls
and
become
imbued
with
the
genius
loci
,
had
seemed
to
his
dreaming
youth
,
as
the
spot
shaped
its
charms
to
him
from
its
halo
on
the
horizon
,
the
obvious
and
ideal
thing
to
do
.
"
let
me
only
get
there
,
"
he
had
said
with
the
fatuousness
of
crusoe
over
his
big
boat
,
"
and
the
rest
is
but
a
matter
of
time
and
energy
.
"
it
would
have
been
far
better
for
him
in
every
way
if
he
had
never
come
within
sight
and
sound
of
the
delusive
precincts
,
had
gone
to
some
busy
commercial
town
with
the
sole
object
of
making
money
by
his
wits
,
and
thence
surveyed
his
plan
in
true
perspective
.
well
,
all
that
was
clear
to
him
amounted
to
this
,
that
the
whole
scheme
had
burst
up
,
like
an
iridescent
soap
-
bubble
,
under
the
touch
of
a
reasoned
inquiry
.
he
looked
back
at
himself
along
the
vista
of
his
past
years
,
and
his
thought
was
akin
to
heine
'
s
:
above
the
youth
'
s
inspired
and
flashing
eyes
i
see
the
motley
mocking
fool
'
s
cap
rise
!
fortunately
he
had
not
been
allowed
to
bring
his
disappointment
into
his
dear
sue
'
s
life
by
involving
her
in
this
collapse
.
and
the
painful
details
of
his
awakening
to
a
sense
of
his
limitations
should
now
be
spared
her
as
far
as
possible
.
after
all
,
she
had
only
know
a
little
part
of
the
miserable
struggle
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
thus
unequipped
,
poor
,
and
unforeseeing
.
he
always
remembered
the
appearance
of
the
afternoon
on
which
he
awoke
from
his
dream
.
not
quite
knowing
what
to
do
with
himself
,
he
went
up
to
an
octagonal
chamber
in
the
lantern
of
a
singularly
built
theatre
that
was
set
amidst
this
quaint
and
singular
city
.
it
had
windows
all
round
,
from
which
an
outlook
over
the
whole
town
and
its
edifices
could
be
gained
.
jude
'
s
eyes
swept
all
the
views
in
succession
,
meditatively
,
mournfully
,
yet
sturdily
.
those
buildings
and
their
associations
and
privileges
were
not
for
him
.
from
the
looming
roof
of
the
great
library
,
into
which
he
hardly
ever
had
time
to
enter
,
his
gaze
travelled
on
to
the
varied
spires
,
halls
,
gables
,
streets
,
chapels
,
gardens
,
quadrangles
,
which
composed
the
ensemble
of
this
unrivalled
panorama
.
he
saw
that
his
destiny
lay
not
with
these
,
but
among
the
manual
toilers
in
the
shabby
purlieu
which
he
himself
occupied
,
unrecognized
as
part
of
the
city
at
all
by
its
visitors
and
panegyrists
,
yet
without
whose
denizens
the
hard
readers
could
not
read
nor
the
high
thinkers
live
.
he
looked
over
the
town
into
the
country
beyond
,
to
the
trees
which
screened
her
whose
presence
had
at
first
been
the
support
of
his
heart
,
and
whose
loss
was
now
a
maddening
torture
.
but
for
this
blow
he
might
have
borne
with
his
fate
.
with
sue
as
companion
he
could
have
renounced
his
ambitions
with
a
smile
.
without
her
it
was
inevitable
that
the
reaction
from
the
long
strain
to
which
he
had
subjected
himself
should
affect
him
disastrously
.
phillotson
had
no
doubt
passed
through
a
similar
intellectual
disappointment
to
that
which
now
enveloped
him
.
but
the
schoolmaster
had
been
since
blest
with
the
consolation
of
sweet
sue
,
while
for
him
there
was
no
consoler
.
descending
to
the
streets
,
he
went
listlessly
along
till
he
arrived
at
an
inn
,
and
entered
it
.
here
he
drank
several
glasses
of
beer
in
rapid
succession
,
and
when
he
came
out
it
was
night
.
by
the
light
of
the
flickering
lamps
he
rambled
home
to
supper
,
and
had
not
long
been
sitting
at
table
when
his
landlady
brought
up
a
letter
that
had
just
arrived
for
him
.
she
laid
it
down
as
if
impressed
with
a
sense
of
its
possible
importance
,
and
on
looking
at
it
jude
perceived
that
it
bore
the
embossed
stamp
of
one
of
the
colleges
whose
heads
he
had
addressed
.
"
one
.
.
.
.
.
.
at
last
!
"
cried
jude
.
the
communication
was
brief
,
and
not
exactly
what
he
had
expected
;
though
it
really
was
from
the
master
in
person
.
it
ran
thus
:
"
biblioll
college
.
"
sir
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
have
read
your
letter
with
interest
;
and
,
judging
from
your
description
of
yourself
as
a
working
-
man
,
i
venture
to
think
that
you
will
have
a
much
better
chance
of
success
in
life
by
remaining
in
your
own
sphere
and
sticking
to
your
trade
than
by
adopting
any
other
course
.
that
,
therefore
,
is
what
i
advise
you
to
do
.
yours
faithfully
,
"
t
.
tetuphenay

"
to
mr
j
.
fawley
,
stone
-
mason
.
"
this
terribly
sensible
advice
exasperated
jude
.
he
had
known
all
that
before
.
he
knew
it
was
true
.
yet
it
seemed
a
hard
slap
after
ten
years
of
labour
,
and
its
effect
upon
him
just
now
was
to
make
him
rise
recklessly
from
the
table
,
and
,
instead
of
reading
as
usual
,
to
go
downstairs
and
into
the
street
.
he
stood
at
a
bar
and
tossed
off
two
or
three
glasses
,
then
unconsciously
sauntered
along
till
he
came
to
a
spot
called
the
fourways
in
the
middle
of
the
city
,
gazing
abstractedly
at
the
groups
of
people
like
one
in
a
trance
,
till
,
coming
to
himself
,
he
began
talking
to
the
policeman
fixed
there
.
that
officer
yawned
,
stretched
out
his
elbows
,
elevated
himself
an
inch
and
a
half
on
the
balls
of
his
toes
,
smiled
,
and
looking
humorously
at
jude
,
said
,
"
you
'
ve
had
a
wet
,
young
man
.
"
"
no
;
i
'
ve
only
begun
,
"
he
replied
cynically
.
whatever
his
wetness
,
his
brains
were
dry
enough
.
he
only
heard
in
part
the
policeman
'
s
further
remarks
,
having
fallen
into
thought
on
what
struggling
people
like
himself
had
stood
at
that
crossway
,
whom
nobody
ever
thought
of
now
.
it
had
more
history
than
the
oldest
college
in
the
city
.
it
was
literally
teeming
,
stratified
,
with
the
shades
of
human
groups
,
who
had
met
there
for
tragedy
,
comedy
,
farce
;
real
enactments
of
the
intensest
kind
.
at
fourways
men
had
stood
and
talked
of
napoleon
,
the
loss
of
america
,
the
execution
of
king
charles
,
the
burning
of
the
martyrs
,
the
crusades
,
the
norman
conquest
,
possibly
of
the
arrival
of
caesar
.
here
the
two
sexes
had
met
for
loving
,
hating
,
coupling
,
parting
;
had
waited
,
had
suffered
,
for
each
other
;
had
triumphed
over
each
other
;
cursed
each
other
in
jealousy
,
blessed
each
other
in
forgiveness
.
he
began
to
see
that
the
town
life
was
a
book
of
humanity
infinitely
more
palpitating
,
varied
,
and
compendious
than
the
gown
life
.
these
struggling
men
and
women
before
him
were
the
reality
of
christminster
,
though
they
knew
little
of
christ
or
minster
.
that
was
one
of
the
humours
of
things
.
the
floating
population
of
students
and
teachers
,
who
did
know
both
in
a
way
,
were
not
christminster
in
a
local
sense
at
all
.
he
looked
at
his
watch
,
and
,
in
pursuit
of
this
idea
,
he
went
on
till
he
came
to
a
public
hall
,
where
a
promenade
concert
was
in
progress
.
jude
entered
,
and
found
the
room
full
of
shop
youths
and
girls
,
soldiers
,
apprentices
,
boys
of
eleven
smoking
cigarettes
,
and
light
women
of
the
more
respectable
and
amateur
class
.
he
had
tapped
the
real
christminster
life
.
a
band
was
playing
,
and
the
crowd
walked
about
and
jostled
each
other
,
and
every
now
and
then
a
man
got
upon
a
platform
and
sang
a
comic
song
.
the
spirit
of
sue
seemed
to
hover
round
him
and
prevent
his
flirting
and
drinking
with
the
frolicsome
girls
who
made
advances
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
wistful
to
gain
a
little
joy
.
at
ten
o
'
clock
he
came
away
,
choosing
a
circuitous
route
homeward
to
pass
the
gates
of
the
college
whose
head
had
just
sent
him
the
note
.
the
gates
were
shut
,
and
,
by
an
impulse
,
he
took
from
his
pocket
the
lump
of
chalk
which
as
a
workman
he
usually
carried
there
,
and
wrote
along
the
wall
:
"
i
have
understanding
as
well
as
you
;
i
am
not
inferior
to
you
:

,

things
as
these
?

the
stroke
of
scorn
relieved
his
mind
,
and
the
next
morning
he
laughed
at
his
self
-
conceit
.
but
the
laugh
was
not
a
healthy
one
.
he
re

read
the
letter

and
the
wisdom
in
its
lines

had
at

exasperated
him

chilled
and
depressed
him
now

he
saw
himself
as

of

intellect
and
emotion
,
he
could
not
proceed
to
his
work
.
whenever
he
felt
reconciled
to
his
fate
as
a
student
,
there
came
to
disturb
his
calm
his
hopeless
relations
with
sue
.
that
the
one
affined
soul
he
had
ever
met
was
lost
to
him
through
his
marriage
returned
upon
him
with
cruel
persistency
,
till
,
unable
to
bear
it
longer
,
he
again
rushed
for
distraction
to
the
real
christminster
life
.
he
now
sought
it
out
in
an
obscure
and
low
-
ceiled
tavern
up
a
court
which
was
well
known
to
certain
worthies
of
the
place
,
and
in
brighter
times
would
have
interested
him
simply
by
its
quaintness
.
here
he
sat
more
or
less
all
the
day
,
convinced
that
he
was
at
bottom
a
vicious
character
,
of
whom
it
was
hopeless
to
expect
anything
.
in
the
evening
the
frequenters
of
the
house
dropped
in
one
by
one
,
jude
still
retaining
his
seat
in
the
corner
,
though
his
money
was
all
spent
,
and
he
had
not
eaten
anything
the
whole
day
except
a
biscuit
.
he
surveyed
his
gathering
companions
with
all
the
equanimity
and
philosophy
of
a
man
who
has
been
drinking
long
and
slowly
,
and
made
friends
with
several
:
to
wit
,
tinker
taylor
,
a
decayed
church
-
ironmonger
who
appeared
to
have
been
of
a
religious
turn
in
earlier
years
,
but
was
somewhat
blasphemous
now
;
also
a
red
-
nosed
auctioneer
;
also
two
gothic
masons
like
himself
,
called
uncle
jim
and
uncle
joe
.
there
were
present
,
too
,
some
clerks
,
and
a
gown
-
and
surplice
-
maker
'
s
assistant
;
two
ladies
who
sported
moral
characters
of
various
depths
of
shade
,
according
to
their
company
,
nicknamed
"
bower
o
'
bliss
"
and
"
freckles
"
;
some
horsey
men
"
in
the
know
"
of
betting
circles
;
a
travelling
actor
from
the
theatre
,
and
two
devil
-
may
-
care
young
men
who
proved
to
be
gownless
undergraduates
;
they
had
slipped
in
by
stealth
to
meet
a
man
about
bull
-
pups
,
and
stayed
to
drink
and
smoke
short
pipes
with
the
racing
gents
aforesaid
,
looking
at
their
watches
every
now
and
then
.
the
conversation
waxed
general
.
christminster
society
was
criticized
,
the
dons
,
magistrates
,
and
other
people
in
authority
being
sincerely
pitied
for
their
shortcomings
,
while
opinions
on
how
they
ought
to
conduct
themselves
and
their
affairs
to
be
properly
respected
,
were
exchanged
in
a
large
-
minded
and
disinterested
manner
.
jude
fawley
,
with
the
self
-
conceit
,
effrontery
,
and
aplomb
of
a
strong
-
brained
fellow
in
liquor
,
threw
in
his
remarks
somewhat
peremptorily
;
and
his
aims
having
been
what
they
were
for
so
many
years
,
everything
the
others
said
turned
upon
his
tongue
,
by
a
sort
of
mechanical
craze
,
to
the
subject
of
scholarship
and
study
,
the
extent
of
his
own
learning
being
dwelt
upon
with
an
insistence
that
would
have
appeared
pitiable
to
himself
in
his
sane
hours
.
"
i
do
not
care
a
damn

"
he
was
saying
,
"

"
"

"
said
the
undergraduates
from
the
corner
,
where
they
were
talking
privately
about
the
pups
"
you
always
was
fond
o

,

not

said
uncle

.
"

haughtily

one
of
the
ladies

said
one
of
the
undergraduates

"
silence
!
"
he
drank
off
the
spirits
in
his
tumbler
,
rapped
with
it
on
the
counter
,
and
announced
,
"
the
gentleman
in
the
corner

going

"
that
'

a
fair
offer

"
said
the
undergraduate
,
throwing
down
the
money
for
the
whisky
.
the
barmaid
concocted
the
mixture
with
the
bearing
of
a
person
compelled
to
live
amongst
animals
of
an
inferior
species
,
and
the
glass
was
handed
across
to
jude
,
who
,
having
drunk
the
contents
,
stood
up
and
began
rhetorically
,
without
hesitation
:
"
good
!
excellent
latin
!
"
cried
one
of
the
undergraduates
,
who
,
however
,
had
not
the
slightest
conception
of
a
single
word
.
a
silence
reigned
among
the
rest
in
the
bar
,
and
the
maid
stood
still
,
jude
'
s
voice
echoing
sonorously
into
the
inner
parlour
,
where
the
landlord
was
dozing
,
and
bringing
him
out
to
see
what
was
going
on
.
jude
had
declaimed
steadily
ahead
,
and
was
continuing
:
"
that
'
s
the
nicene
,
"
sneered
the
second
undergraduate
.
"
and
we
wanted
the
apostles
'
!
"
"
you
did
not
say
so
!
and
every
fool
knows
,

that

is
the
most
historic
creed
!
"
"
let
un
go
on
,
let
un
go
on

"
said
the
auctioneer
.
but
jude
'
s
mind
seemed
to
grow
confused
soon
,
and
he
could
not
get
on
.
he
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
and
his
face
assumed
an
expression
of
pain
.
"
give
him
another
glass
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
then
he
will
fetch
up
and
get
through
it

"
said
tinker
taylor
.
somebody
threw
down
threepence
,
the
glass
was
handed
,
jude
stretched
out
his
arm
for
it
without
looking
,
and
having
swallowed
the
liquor
,
went
on
in
a
moment
in
a
revived
voice
,
raising
it
as
he
neared
the
end
with
the
manner
of
a
priest
leading
a
congregation
:
"
well
done
!
"
said
several
,
enjoying
the
last
word
,
as
being
the
first
and
only
one
they
had
recognized
.
then
jude
seemed
to
shake
the
fumes
from
his
brain
,
as
he
stared
round
upon
them
.
"
you
pack
of
fools
!
"
he
cried
.
"
which
one
of
you
knows
whether
i
have
said
it

no

"
the
landlord
,
who
had
already
had
his
license
endorsed
for
harbouring
queer
characters
,
feared
a
riot
,
and
came
outside
the
counter
;
but
jude
,
in
his
sudden
flash
of
reason
,
had
turned
in
disgust
and
left
the
scene
,
the
door
slamming
with
a
dull
thud
behind
him
.
he
hastened
down
the
lane
and
round
into
the
straight
broad
street
,
which
he
followed
till
it
merged
in
the
highway
,
and
all
sound
of
his
late
companions
had
been
left
behind
.
onward
he
still
went
,
under
the
influence
of
a
childlike
yearning
for
the
one
being
in
the
world
to
whom
it
seemed
possible
to
fly
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
an
unreasoning
desire
,
whose
ill
judgement
was
not
apparent
to
him
now
.
in
the
course
of
an
hour
,
when
it
was
between
ten
and
eleven
o
'
clock
,
he
entered
the
village
of
lumsdon
,
and
reaching
the
cottage
,
saw
that
a
light
was
burning
in
a
downstairs
room
,
which
he
assumed
,
rightly
as
it
happened
,
to
be
hers
.
jude
stepped
close
to
the
wall
,
and
tapped
with
his
finger
on
the
pane
,
saying
impatiently
,
"
sue
,
sue
!
"
she
must
have
recognized
his
voice
,
for
the
light
disappeared
from
the
apartment
,
and
in
a
second
or
two
the
door
was
unlocked
and
opened
,
and
sue
appeared
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
.
"
is
it
jude
?
yes
,
it
is
!
my
dear
,
dear
cousin
,
what
'
s
the
matter

"
"
oh
,
i
am
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
could
not
help
coming

said
he
,
sinking
down
upon
the
doorstep
.
"
i
am
so
wicked
,
sue

.
.
.
.
.
.
my
heart
is
nearly
broken
,
and
i
could
not
bear
my
life
as
it
was
!
so
i
have
been
drinking
,
and
blaspheming
,
or
next
door
to
it
,
and
saying
holy
things
in
disreputable
quarters
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
repeating
in
idle
bravado
words
which
ought
never
to
be
uttered
but
reverently
!
oh

anything
with
me
,
sue

.
.

,
and
do
not

"
with
one
hand
holding
the
candle
and
the
other
supporting
him
,
she
led
him
indoors
,
and
placed
him
in
the
only
easy
chair
the
meagrely
furnished
house
afforded
,
stretching
his
feet
upon
another
,
and
pulling
off
his
boots
.
jude
,
now
getting
towards
his
sober
senses
,
could
only
say
,
"
dear
,
dear
sue
!
"
in
a
voice
broken
by
grief
and
contrition
.
she
asked
him
if
he
wanted
anything
to
eat
,
but
he
shook
his
head
.
then
telling
him
to
go
to
sleep
,
and
that
she
would
come
down
early
in
the
morning
and
get
him
some
breakfast
,
she
bade
him
good
-
night
and
ascended
the
stairs
.
almost
immediately
he
fell
into
a
heavy
slumber
,
and
did
not
wake
till
dawn
.
at
first
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
,
but
by
degrees
his
situation
cleared
to
him
,
and
he
beheld
it
in
all
the
ghastliness
of
a
right
mind
.
she
knew
the
worst
of
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
very
worst
.
how
could
he
face
her
now
?
she
would
soon
be
coming
down
to
see
about
breakfast
,
as
she
had
said
,
and
there
would
he
be
in
all
his
shame
confronting
her
.
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
,
and
softly
drawing
on
his
boots
,
and
taking
his
hat
from
the
nail
on
which
she
had
hung
it
,
he
slipped
noiselessly
out
of
the
house
.
his
fixed
idea
was
to
get
away
to
some
obscure
spot
and
hide
,
and
perhaps
pray
;
and
the
only
spot
which
occurred
to
him
was
marygreen
.
he
called
at
his
lodging
in
christminster
,
where
he
found
awaiting
him
a
note
of
dismissal
from
his
employer
;
and
having
packed
up
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
city
that
had
been
such
a
thorn
in
his
side
,
and
struck
southward
into
wessex
.
he
had
no
money
left
in
his
pocket
,
his
small
savings
,
deposited
at
one
of
the
banks
in
christminster
,
having
fortunately
been
left
untouched
.
to
get
to
marygreen
,
therefore
,
his
only
course
was
walking
;
and
the
distance
being
nearly
twenty
miles
,
he
had
ample
time
to
complete
on
the
way
the
sobering
process
begun
in
him
.
at
some
hour
of
the
evening
he
reached
alfredston
.
here
he
pawned
his
waistcoat
,
and
having
gone
out
of
the
town
a
mile
or
two
,
slept
under
a
rick
that
night
.
at
dawn
he
rose
,
shook
off
the
hayseeds
and
stems
from
his
clothes
,
and
started
again
,
breasting
the
long
white
road
up
the
hill
to
the
downs
,
which
had
been
visible
to
him
a
long
way
off
,
and
passing
the
milestone
at
the
top
,
whereon
he
had
carved
his
hopes
years
ago
.
he
reached
the
ancient
hamlet
while
the
people
were
at
breakfast
.
weary
and
mud
-
bespattered
,
but
quite
possessed
of
his
ordinary
clearness
of
brain
,
he
sat
down
by
the
well
,
thinking
as
he
did
so
what
a
poor
christ
he
made
.
seeing
a
trough
of
water
near
he
bathed
his
face
,
and
went
on
to
the
cottage
of
his
great
-
aunt
,
whom
he
found
breakfasting
in
bed
,
attended
by
the
woman
who
lived
with
her
.
"
what
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
out
o
'
work
?
"
asked
his
relative
,
regarding
him
through
eyes
sunken
deep
,
under
lids
heavy
as
pot
-
covers
,
no
other
cause
for
his
tumbled
appearance
suggesting
itself
to
one
whose
whole
life
had
been
a
struggle
with
material
things
.
"
yes
,
"
said
jude
heavily
.
"
i
think
i
must
have
a
little
rest
.
"
refreshed
by
some
breakfast
,
he
went
up
to
his
old
room
and
lay
down
in
his
shirt
-
sleeves
,
after
the
manner
of
the
artizan
.
he
fell
asleep
for
a
short
while
,
and
when
he
awoke
it
was
as
if
he
had
awakened
in
hell
.
it
was
hell
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
the
hell
of
conscious
failure
,
"
both
in
ambition
and
in
love
.
he
thought
of
that
previous
abyss
into
which
he
had
fallen
before
leaving
this
part
of
the
country
;
the
deepest
deep
he
had
supposed
it
then
;
but
it
was
not
so
deep
as
this
.
that
had
been
the
breaking
in
of
the
outer
bulwarks
of
his
hope
:
this
was
of
his
second
line
.
if
he
had
been
a
woman
he
must
have
screamed
under
the
nervous
tension
which
he
was
now
undergoing
.
but
that
relief
being
denied
to
his
virility
,
he
clenched
his
teeth
in
misery
,
bringing
lines
about
his
mouth
like
those
in
the
laocoon
,
and
corrugations
between
his
brows
.
a
mournful
wind
blew
through
the
trees
,
and
sounded
in
the
chimney
like
the
pedal
notes
of
an
organ
.
each
ivy
leaf
overgrowing
the
wall
of
the
churchless
church
-
yard
hard
by
,
now
abandoned
,
pecked
its
neighbour
smartly
,
and
the
vane
on
the
new
victorian
-
gothic
church
in
the
new
spot
had
already
begun
to
creak
.
yet
apparently
it
was
not
always
the
outdoor
wind
that
made
the
deep
murmurs
;
it
was
a
voice
.
he
guessed
its
origin
in
a
moment
or
two
;
the
curate
was
praying
with
his
aunt
in
the
adjoining
room
.
he
remembered
her
speaking
of
him
.
presently
the
sounds
ceased
,
and
a
step
seemed
to
cross
the
landing
.
jude
sat
up
,
and
shouted
"
hoi
!
"
the
step
made
for
his
door
,
which
was
open
,
and
a
man
looked
in
.
it
was
a
young
clergyman
.
"
i
think
you
are
mr
highridge
,
"
said
jude
.
"
my
aunt
has
mentioned
you
more
than
once
.
well
,
here
i
am
,
just
come
home
;
a
fellow
gone
to
the
bad
;
though
i
had
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
at
one
time
.
now
i
am
melancholy
mad
,
what
with
drinking
and
one
thing
and
another
.
"
slowly
jude
unfolded
to
the
curate
his
late
plans
and
movements
,
by
an
unconscious
bias
dwelling
less
upon
the
intellectual
and
ambitious
side
of
his
dream
,
and
more
upon
the
theological
,
though
this
had
,
up
till
now
,
been
merely
a
portion
of
the
general
plan
of
advancement
.
"
now
i
know
i
have
been
a
fool
,
and
that
folly
is
with
me
,
"
added
jude
in
conclusion
.
"
and
i
do
not
regret
the
collapse
of
my
university
hopes
one
jot
.
i
would
not
begin
again
if
i
were
sure
to
succeed
.
i
do
not
care
for
social
success
any
more
at
all
.
but
i
do
feel
i
should
like
to
do
some
good
thing
;
and
i
bitterly
regret
the
church
,
and
the
loss
of
my
chance
of
being
her
ordained
minister
.
"
the
curate
,
who
was
a
new
man
to
this
neighbourhood
,
had
grown
deeply
interested
,
and
at
last
he
said
:
"
if
you
feel
a
real
call
to
the
ministry
,
and
i
wo
not
say
from
your
conversation
that
you
do
not
,
for
it
is
that
of
a
thoughtful
and
educated
man
,
you
might
enter
the
church
as
a
licentiate
.
only
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
avoid
strong
drink
.
"
"
i
could
avoid
that
easily
enough
,
if
i
had
any
kind
of
hope
to
support
me
!
"
it
was
a
new
idea
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
ecclesiastical
and
altruistic
life
as
distinct
from
the
intellectual
and
emulative
life
.
a
man
could
preach
and
do
good
to
his
fellow
-
creatures
without
taking
double
-
firsts
in
the
schools
of
christminster
,
or
having
anything
but
ordinary
knowledge
.
the
old
fancy
which
had
led
on
to
the
culminating
vision
of
the
bishopric
had
not
been
an
ethical
or
theological
enthusiasm
at
all
,
but
a
mundane
ambition
masquerading
in
a
surplice
.
he
feared
that
his
whole
scheme
had
degenerated
to
,
even
though
it
might
not
have
originated
in
,
a
social
unrest
which
had
no
foundation
in
the
nobler
instincts
;
which
was
purely
an
artificial
product
of
civilization
.
there
were
thousands
of
young
men
on
the
same
self
-
seeking
track
at
the
present
moment
.
the
sensual
hind
who
ate
,
drank
,
and
lived
carelessly
with
his
wife
through
the
days
of
his
vanity
was
a
more
likable
being
than
he
.
but
to
enter
the
church
in
such
an
unscholarly
way
that
he
could
not
in
any
probability
rise
to
a
higher
grade
through
all
his
career
than
that
of
the
humble
curate
wearing
his
life
out
in
an
obscure
village
or
city
slum
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
might
have
a
touch
of
goodness
and
greatness
in
it
;
that
might
be
true
religion
,
and
a
purgatorial
course
worthy
of
being
followed
by
a
remorseful
man
.
the
favourable
light
in
which
this
new
thought
showed
itself
by
contrast
with
his
foregone
intentions
cheered
jude
,
as
he
sat
there
,
shabby
and
lonely
;
and
it
may
be
said
to
have
given
,
during
the
next
few
days
,
the
coup
de
grace
to
his
intellectual
career
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
career
which
had
extended
over
the
greater
part
of
a
dozen
years
.
he
did
nothing
,
however
,
for
some
long
stagnant
time
to
advance
his
new
desire
,
occupying
himself
with
little
local
jobs
in
putting
up
and
lettering
headstones
about
the
neighbouring
villages
,
and
submitting
to
be
regarded
as
a
social
failure
,
a
returned
purchase
,
by
the
half
-
dozen
or
so
of
farmers
and
other
country
-
people
who
condescended
to
nod
to
him
.
the
human
interest
of
the
new
intention
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
a
human
interest
is
indispensable
to
the
most
spiritual
and
self
-
sacrificing

.
was
created
by
a
letter
from
sue
,
bearing
a
fresh
postmark
.
she
evidently
wrote
with
anxiety
,
and
told
very
little
about
her
own
doings
,
more
than
that
she
had
passed
some
sort
of
examination
for
a
queen
'
s
scholarship
,
and
was
going
to
enter
a
training
college
at
melchester
to
complete
herself
for
the
vocation
she
had
chosen
,
partly
by
his
influence
.
there
was
a
theological
college
at
melchester
;
melchester
was
a
quiet
and
soothing
place
,
almost
entirely
ecclesiastical
in
its
tone
;
a
spot
where
worldly
learning
and
intellectual
smartness
had
no
establishment
;
where
the
altruistic
feeling
that
he
did
possess
would
perhaps
be
more
highly
estimated
than
a
brilliancy
which
he
did
not
.
as
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
continue
for
a
time
to
work
at
his
trade
while
reading
up
divinity
,
which
he
had
neglected
at
christminster
for
the
ordinary
classical
grind
,
what
better
course
for
him
than
to
get
employment
at
the
further
city
,
and
pursue
this
plan
of
reading
?
that
his
excessive
human
interest
in
the
new
place
was
entirely
of
sue
'
s
making
,
while
at
the
same
time
sue
was
to
be
regarded
even
less
than
formerly
as
proper
to
create
it
,
had
an
ethical
contradictoriness
to
which
he
was
not
blind
.
but
that
much
he
conceded
to
human
frailty
,
and
hoped
to
learn
to
love
her
only
as
a
friend
and
kinswoman
.
he
considered
that
he
might
so
mark
out
his
coming
years
as
to
begin
his
ministry
at
the
age
of
thirty
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
an
age
which
much
attracted
him
as
being
that
of
his
exemplar
when
he
first
began
to
teach
in
galilee
.
this
would
allow
him
plenty
of
time
for
deliberate
study
,
and
for
acquiring
capital
by
his
trade
to
help
his
aftercourse
of
keeping
the
necessary
terms
at
a
theological
college
.
christmas
had
come
and
passed
,
and
sue
had
gone
to
the
melchester
normal
school
.
the
time
was
just
the
worst
in
the
year
for
jude
to
get
into
new
employment
,
and
he
had
written
suggesting
to
her
that
he
should
postpone
his
arrival
for
a
month
or
so
,
till
the
days
had
lengthened
.
she
had
acquiesced
so
readily
that
he
wished
he
had
not
proposed
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
she
evidently
did
not
much
care
about
him
,
though
she
had
never
once
reproached
him
for
his
strange
conduct
in
coming
to
her
that
night
,
and
his
silent
disappearance
.
neither
had
she
ever
said
a
word
about
her
relations
with
mr
phillotson
.
suddenly
,
however
,
quite
a
passionate
letter
arrived
from
sue
.
she
was
quite
lonely
and
miserable
,
she
told
him
.
she
hated
the
place
she
was
in
;
it
was
worse
than
the
ecclesiastical
designer
'
s
;
worse
than
anywhere
.
she
felt
utterly
friendless
;
could
he
come
immediately
?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
though
when
he
did
come
she
would
only
be
able
to
see
him
at
limited
times
,
the
rules
of
the
establishment
she
found
herself
in
being
strict
to
a
degree
.
it
was
mr
phillotson
who
had
advised
her
to
come
there
,
and
she
wished
she
had
never
listened
to
him
.
phillotson
'
s
suit
was
not
exactly
prospering
,
evidently
;
and
jude
felt
unreasonably
glad
.
he
packed
up
his
things
and
went
to
melchester
with
a
lighter
heart
than
he
had
known
for
months
.
this
being
the
turning
over
a
new
leaf
he
duly
looked
about
for
a
temperance
hotel
,
and
found
a
little
establishment
of
that
description
in
the
street
leading
from
the
station
.
when
he
had
had
something
to
eat
he
walked
out
into
the
dull
winter
light
over
the
town
bridge
,
and
turned
the
corner
towards
the
close
.
the
day
was
foggy
,
and
standing
under
the
walls
of
the
most
graceful
architectural
pile
in
england
he
paused
and
looked
up
.
the
lofty
building
was
visible
as
far
as
the
roofridge
;
above
,
the
dwindling
spire
rose
more
and
more
remotely
,
till
its
apex
was
quite
lost
in
the
mist
drifting
across
it
.
the
lamps
now
began
to
be
lighted
,
and
turning
to
the
west
front
he
walked
round
.
he
took
it
as
a
good
omen
that
numerous
blocks
of
stone
were
lying
about
,
which
signified
that
the
cathedral
was
undergoing
restoration
or
repair
to
a
considerable
extent
.
it
seemed
to
him
,
full
of
the
superstitions
of
his
beliefs
,
that
this
was
an
exercise
of
forethought
on
the
part
of
a
ruling
power
,
that
he
might
find
plenty
to
do
in
the
art
he
practised
while
waiting
for
a
call
to
higher
labours
.
then
a
wave
of
warmth
came
over
him
as
he
thought
how
near
he
now
stood
to
the
bright
-
eyed
vivacious
girl
with
the
broad
forehead
and
pile
of
dark
hair
above
it
;
the
girl
with
the
kindling
glance
,
daringly
soft
at
times
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
something
like
that
of
the
girls
he
had
seen
in
engravings
from
paintings
of
the
spanish
school
.
she
was
here
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
actually
in
this
close
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
one
of
the
houses
confronting
this
very
west
facade
.
he
went
down
the
broad
gravel
path
towards
the
building
.
it
was
an
ancient
edifice
of
the
fifteenth
century
,
once
a
palace
,
now
a
training
-
school
,
with
mullioned
and
transomed
windows
,
and
a
courtyard
in
front
shut
in
from
the
road
by
a
wall
.
jude
opened
the
gate
and
went
up
to
the
door
through
which
,
on
inquiring
for
his
cousin
,
he
was
gingerly
admitted
to
a
waiting
-
room
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
came
.
though
she
had
been
here
such
a
short
while
,
she
was
not
as
he
had
seen
her
last
.
all
her
bounding
manner
was
gone
;
her
curves
of
motion
had
become
subdued
lines
.
the
screens
and
subtleties
of
convention
had
likewise
disappeared
.
yet
neither
was
she
quite
the
woman
who
had
written
the
letter
that
summoned
him
.
that
had
plainly
been
dashed
off
in
an
impulse
which
second
thoughts
had
somewhat
regretted
;
thoughts
that
were
possibly
of
his
recent
self
-
disgrace
.
jude
was
quite
overcome
with
emotion
.
"
you
don
'
t
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
think
me
a
demoralized
wretch
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
coming
to
you
as
i
was
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
going
so
shamefully
,
sue
?
"
"
oh
,
i
have
tried
not
to
!
you
said
enough
to
let
me
know
what
had
caused
it
.
i
hope
i
shall
never
have
any
doubt
of
your
worthiness
,
my
poor
jude
!
and
i
am
glad
you
have
come
!
"
she
wore
a
murrey
-
coloured
gown
with
a
little
lace
collar
.
it
was
made
quite
plain
,
and
hung
about
her
slight
figure
with
clinging
gracefulness
.
her
hair
,
which
formerly
she
had
worn
according
to
the
custom
of
the
day
was
now
twisted
up
tightly
,
and
she
had
altogether
the
air
of
a
woman
clipped
and
pruned
by
severe
discipline
,
an
under
-
brightness
shining
through
from
the
depths
which
that
discipline
had
not
yet
been
able
to
reach
.
she
had
come
forward
prettily
,
but
jude
felt
that
she
had
hardly
expected
him
to
kiss
her
,
as
he
was
burning
to
do
,
under
other
colours
than
those
of
cousinship
.
he
could
not
perceive
the
least
sign
that
sue
regarded
him
as
a
lover
,
or
ever
would
do
so
,
now
that
she
knew
the
worst
of
him
,
even
if
he
had
the
right
to
behave
as
one
;
and
this
helped
on
his
growing
resolve
to
tell
her
of
his
matrimonial
entanglement
,
which
he
had
put
off
doing
from
time
to
time
in
sheer
dread
of
losing
the
bliss
of
her
company
.
sue
came
out
into
the
town
with
him
,
and
they
walked
and
talked
with
tongues
centred
only
on
the
passing
moments
.
jude
said
he
would
like
to
buy
her
a
little
present
of
some
sort
,
and
then
she
confessed
,
with
something
of
shame
,
that
she
was
dreadfully
hungry
.
they
were
kept
on
very
short
allowances
in
the
college
,
and
a
dinner
,
tea
,
and
supper
all
in
one
was
the
present
she
most
desired
in
the
world
.
jude
thereupon
took
her
to
an
inn
and
ordered
whatever
the
house
afforded
,
which
was
not
much
.
the
place
,
however
,
gave
them
a
delightful
opportunity
for
a
tete
-
a
-
tete
,
nobody
else
being
in
the
room
,
and
they
talked
freely
.
she
told
him
about
the
school
as
it
was
at
that
date
,
and
the
rough
living
,
and
the
mixed
character
of
her
fellow
-
students
,
gathered
together
from
all
parts
of
the
diocese
,
and
how
she
had
to
get
up
and
work
by
gas
-
light
in
the
early
morning
,
with
all
the
bitterness
of
a
young
person
to
whom
restraint
was
new
.
to
all
this
he
listened
;
but
it
was
not
what
he
wanted
especially
to
know
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
her
relations
with
phillotson
.
that
was
what
she
did
not
tell
.
when
they
had
sat
and
eaten
,
jude
impulsively
placed
his
hand
upon
hers
;
she
looked
up
and
smiled
,
and
took
his
quite
freely
into
her
own
little
soft
one
,
dividing
his
fingers
and
coolly
examining
them
,
as
if
they
were
the
fingers
of
a
glove
she
was
purchasing
.
"
your
hands
are
rather
rough
,
jude
,
are
not
they
?
"
she
said
.
"
yes
.
so
would
yours
be
if
they
held
a
mallet
and
chisel
all
day
.
"
"
i
do
not
dislike
it
,
you
know
.
i
think
it
is
noble
to
see
a
man
'
s
hands
subdued
to
what
he
works
in
.
.
.
.
well
,
i
am
rather
glad
i
came
to
this
training
-
school

after
all

how
independent

shall
be
after
the
two
years
'
training
!
i
shall
pass
pretty
high
,
i
expect
,
and
mr
phillotson
will
use
his
influence
to
get
me
a
big
school
.
"
she
had
touched
the
subject
at
last
.
"
i
had
a
suspicion
,
a
fear
,
"
said
jude
,
"
that
he
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
cared
about
you
rather
warmly
,
and
perhaps
wanted
to
marry
you
.
"
"
now
do
not
be
such
a
silly
boy
!
"
"
he
has
said
something
about
it
,
i
expect
.
"
"
if
he
had
,
what
would
it
matter
?
an
old
man
like
him
!
"
"
oh
,
come
,
sue
;
he
is
not
so
very
old
.
and
i
know
what
i
saw
him
doing
"
not
kissing
me
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
i
am
certain
!
"
"
no
.
but
putting
his
arm
round
your
waist
.
"
"
ah
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
remember
.
but
i
did
not
know
he
was
going
to
.
"
"
you
are
wriggling
out
if
it
,
sue
,
and
it
is
not
quite
kind
!
"
her
ever
-
sensitive
lip
began
to
quiver
,
and
her
eye
to
blink
,
at
something
this
reproof
was
deciding
her
to
say
.
"
i
know
you
will
be
angry
if
i
tell
you
everything
,
and
that
'
s
why
i
do
not
want
to
!
"
"
very
well
,
then
,
dear
,
"
he
said
soothingly
.
"
i
have
no
real
right
to
ask
you
,
and
i
do
not
wish
to
know
.
"
"
i
shall
tell
you
!
"
said
she
,
with
the
perverseness
that
was
part
of
her
.
"
this
is
what
i
have
done
:
i
have
promised
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
have
promised
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
i
will
marry
him
when
i
come
out
of
the
training
-
school
two
years
hence
,
and
have
got
my
certificate
;
his
plan
being
that
we
shall
then
take
a
large
double
school
in
a
great
town
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
the
boys
'
and
i
the
girls
'
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
married
school
-
teachers
often
do
,
and
make
a
good
income
between
us
.
"
"
oh
,
sue
!
.
.
.
but
of
course
it
is
right
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
could
not
have
done
better
!
"
he
glanced
at
her
and
their
eyes
met
,
the
reproach
in
his
own
belying
his
words
.
then
he
drew
his
hand
quite
away
from
hers
,
and
turned
his
face
in
estrangement
from
her
to
the
window
.
sue
regarded
him
passively
without
moving
.
"
i
knew
you
would
be
angry
!
"
she
said
with
an
air
of
no
emotion
whatever
.
"
very
well
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
am
wrong
,
i
suppose
!
i
ought
not
to
have
let
you
come
to
see
me
!
we
had
better
not
meet
again
;
and
we
will
only
correspond
at
long
intervals
,
on
purely
business
matters
!
"
this
was
just
the
one
thing
he
would
not
be
able
to
bear
,
as
she
probably
knew
,
and
it
brought
him
round
at
once
.
"
oh
yes
,
we
will
,
"
he
said
quickly
.
"
your
being
engaged
can
make
no
difference
to
me
whatever
.
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
see
you
when
i
want
to
;
and
i
shall
!
"
"
then
do
not
let
us
talk
of
it
any
more
.
it
is
quite
spoiling
our
evening
together
.
what
does
it
matter
about
what
one
is
going
to
do
two
years
hence
!
"
she
was
something
of
a
riddle
to
him
,
and
he
let
the
subject
drift
away
.
"
shall
we
go
and
sit
in
the
cathedral
?
"
he
asked
,
when
their
meal
was
finished
.
"
cathedral
?
yes
.
though
i
think
i
'
d
rather
sit
in
the
railway
station
,
"
she
answered
,
a
remnant
of
vexation
still
in
her
voice
.
"
that
'
s
the
centre
of
the
town
life
now
.
the
cathedral
has
had
its
day
!
"
"
how
modern
you
are
!
"
"
so
would
you
be
if
you
had
lived
so
much
in
the
middle
ages
as
i
have
done
these
last
few
years
!
the
cathedral
was
a
very
good
place
four
or
five
centuries
ago
;
but
it
is
played
out
now
.
.
.
i
am
not
modern
,
either
.
i
am
more
ancient
than
mediaevalism
,
if
you
only
knew
.
"
jude
looked
distressed
.
"
there
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
wo
not
say
any
more
of
that
!
"
she
cried
.
"
only
you
do
not
know
how
bad
i
am
,
from
your
point
of
view
,
or
you
would
not
think
so
much
of
me
,
or
care
whether
i
was
engaged
or
not
.
now
there
'
s
just
time
for
us
to
walk
round
the
close
,
then
i
must
go
in
,
or
i
shall
be
locked
out
for
the
night
.
"
he
took
her
to
the
gate
and
they
parted
.
jude
had
a
conviction
that
his
unhappy
visit
to
her
on
that
sad
night
had
precipitated
this
marriage
engagement
,
and
it
did
anything
but
add
to
his
happiness
.
her
reproach
had
taken
that
shape
,
then
,
and
not
the
shape
of
words
.
however
,
next
day
he
set
about
seeking
employment
,
which
it
was
not
so
easy
to
get
as
at
christminster
,
there
being
,
as
a
rule
,
less
stone
-
cutting
in
progress
in
this
quiet
city
,
and
hands
being
mostly
permanent
.
but
he
edged
himself
in
by
degrees
.
his
first
work
was
some
carving
at
the
cemetery
on
the
hill
;
and
ultimately
he
became
engaged
on
the
labour
he
most
desired
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
cathedral
repairs
,
which
were
very
extensive
,
the
whole
interior
stonework
having
been
overhauled
,
to
be
largely
replaced
by
new
.
it
might
be
a
labour
of
years
to
get
it
all
done
,
and
he
had
confidence
enough
in
his
own
skill
with
the
mallet
and
chisel
to
feel
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
choice
with
himself
how
long
he
would
stay
.
the
lodgings
he
took
near
the
close
gate
would
not
have
disgraced
a
curate
,
the
rent
representing
a
higher
percentage
on
his
wages
than
mechanics
of
any
sort
usually
care
to
pay
.
his
combined
bed
and
sitting
-
room
was
furnished
with
framed
photographs
of
the
rectories
and
deaneries
at
which
his
landlady
had
lived
as
trusted
servant
in
her
time
,
and
the
parlour
downstairs
bore
a
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
inscribed
to
the
effect
that
it
was
presented
to
the
same
serious
-
minded
woman
by
her
fellow
-
servants
on
the
occasion
of
her
marriage
.
jude
added
to
the
furniture
of
his
room
by
unpacking
photographs
of
the
ecclesiastical
carvings
and
monuments
that
he
had
executed
with
his
own
hands
;
and
he
was
deemed
a
satisfactory
acquisition
as
tenant
of
the
vacant
apartment
.
he
found
an
ample
supply
of
theological
books
in
the
city
book
-
shops
,
and
with
these
his
studies
were
recommenced
in
a
different
spirit
and
direction
from
his
former
course
.
as
a
relaxation
from
the
fathers
,
and
such
stock
works
as
paley
and
butler
,
he
read
newman
,
pusey
,
and
many
other
modern
lights
.
he
hired
a
harmonium
,
set
it
up
in
his
lodging
,
and
practised
chants
thereon
,
single
and
double
.
"

of
pictures

"
their
conversation
had
run
thus
some
few
weeks
later
,
and
next
morning
they
prepared
to
start
.
every
detail
of
the
outing
was
a
facet
reflecting
a
sparkle
to
jude
,
and
he
did
not
venture
to
meditate
on
the
life
of
inconsistency
he
was
leading
.
his
sue
'
s
conduct
was
one
lovely
conundrum
to
him
;
he
could
say
no
more
.
there
duly
came
the
charm
of
calling
at
the
college
door
for
her
;
her
emergence
in
a
nunlike
simplicity
of
costume
that
was
rather
enforced
than
desired
;
the
traipsing
along
to
the
station
,
the
porters
'
"
b
'
your
leave
!
,
"
the
screaming
of
the
trains
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
everything
formed
the
basis
of
a
beautiful
crystallization
.
nobody
stared
at
sue
,
because
she
was
so
plainly
dressed
,
which
comforted
jude
in
the
thought
that
only
himself
knew
the
charms
those
habiliments
subdued
.
a
matter
of
ten
pounds
spent
in
a
drapery
-
shop
,
which
had
no
connection
with
her
real
life
or
her
real
self
,
would
have
set
all
melchester
staring
.
the
guard
of
the
train
thought
they
were
lovers
,
and
put
them
into
a
compartment
all
by
themselves
.
"
that
'
s
a
good
intention
wasted
!
"
said
she
.
jude
did
not
respond
.
he
thought
the
remark
unnecessarily
cruel
,
and
partly
untrue
.
they
reached
the
park
and
castle
and
wandered
through
the
picture
-
galleries
,
jude
stopping
by
preference
in
front
of
the
devotional
pictures
by
del
sarto
,
guido
reni
,
spagnoletto
,
sassoferrato
,
carlo
dolci
,
and
others
.
sue
paused
patiently
beside
him
,
and
stole
critical
looks
into
his
face
as
,
regarding
the
virgins
,
holy
families
,
and
saints
,
it
grew
reverent
and
abstracted
.
when
she
had
thoroughly
estimated
him
at
this
,
she
would
move
on
and
wait
for
him
before
a
lely
or
reynolds
.
it
was
evident
that
her
cousin
deeply
interested
her
,
as
one
might
be
interested
in
a
man
puzzling
out
his
way
along
a
labyrinth
from
which
one
had
one
'
s
self
escaped
.
when
they
came
out
a
long
time
still
remained
to
them
and
jude
proposed
that
as
soon
as
they
had
had
something
to
eat
they
should
walk
across
the
high
country
to
the
north
of
their
present
position
,
and
intercept
the
train
of
another
railway
leading
back
to
melchester
,
at
a
station
about
seven
miles
off
.
sue
,
who
was
inclined
for
any
adventure
that
would
intensify
the
sense
of
her
day
'
s
freedom
,
readily
agreed
;
and
away
they
went
,
leaving
the
adjoining
station
behind
them
.
it
was
indeed
open
country
,
wide
and
high
.
they
talked
and
bounded
on
,
jude
cutting
from
a
little
covert
a
long
walking
-
stick
for
sue
as
tall
as
herself
,
with
a
great
crook
,
which
made
her
look
like
a
shepherdess
.
about
half
-
way
on
their
journey
they
crossed
a
main
road
running
due
east
and
west
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
old
road
from
london
to
land
'
s
end
.
they
paused
,
and
looked
up
and
down
it
for
a
moment
,
and
remarked
upon
the
desolation
which
had
come
over
this
once
lively
thoroughfare
,
while
the
wind
dipped
to
earth
and
scooped
straws
and
hay
-
stems
from
the
ground
.
they
crossed
the
road
and
passed
on
,
but
during
the
next
half
-
mile
sue
seemed
to
grow
tired
,
and
jude
began
to
be
distressed
for
her
.
they
had
walked
a
good
distance
altogether
,
and
if
they
could
not
reach
the
other
station
it
would
be
rather
awkward
.
for
a
long
time
there
was
no
cottage
visible
on
the
wide
expanse
of
down
and
turnip
-
land
;
but
presently
they
came
to
a
sheepfold
,
and
next
to
the
shepherd
,
pitching
hurdles
.
he
told
them
that
the
only
house
near
was
his
mother
'
s
and
his
,
pointing
to
a
little
dip
ahead
from
which
a
faint
blue
smoke
arose
,
and
recommended
them
to
go
on
and
rest
there
.
this
they
did
,
and
entered
the
house
,
admitted
by
an
old
woman
without
a
single
tooth
,
to
whom
they
were
as
civil
as
strangers
can
be
when
their
only
chance
of
rest
and
shelter
lies
in
the
favour
of
the
householder
.
"
a
nice
little
cottage
,
"
said
jude
.
"
oh
,
i
do
not
know
about
the
niceness
.
i
shall
have
to
thatch
it
soon
,
and
where
the
thatch
is
to
come
from
i
ca
not
tell
,
for
straw
do
get
that
dear
,
that
'
twill
soon
be
cheaper
to
cover
your
house
wi
'
chainey
plates
than
thatch
.
"
they
sat
resting
,
and
the
shepherd
came
in
.
"
do
not
'
ee
mind
i
,
"
he
said
with
a
deprecating
wave
of
the
hand
"
bide
here
as
long
as
ye
will
.
but
mid
you
be
thinking
o
'
getting
back
to
melchester
to
-
night
by
train
?
because
you
will
never
do
it
in
this
world
,
since
you
do
not
know
the
lie
of
the
country
.
i
do
not
mind
going
with
ye
some
o
'
the
ways
,
but
even
then
the
train
mid
be
gone
.
"
they
started
up
.
"
you
can
bide
here
,
you
know
,
over
the
night
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
ca
not
'
em
,
mother
?
the
place
is
welcome
to
ye
.
'
tis
hard
lying
,
rather
,
but
volk
may
do
worse
.
"
he
turned
to
jude
and
asked
privately
:
"
be
you
a
married
couple
?
"
"
hsh
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
no
!
"
said
jude
.
"
oh
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
meant
nothing
ba
'
dy
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
not
i
!
well
then
,
she
can
go
into
mother
'
s
room
,
and
you
and
i
can
lie
in
the
outer
chimmer
after
they
'
ve
gone
through
.
i
can
call
ye
soon
enough
to
catch
the
first
train
back
.
you
'
ve
lost
this
one
now
.
"
on
consideration
they
decided
to
close
with
this
offer
,
and
drew
up
and
shared
with
the
shepherd
and
his
mother
the
boiled
bacon
and
greens
for
supper
.
"
i
rather
like
this
,
"
said
sue
,
while
their
entertainers
were
clearing
away
the
dishes
.
"
outside
all
laws
except
gravitation
and
germination
.
"
"
you
only
think
you
like
it
;
you
don
'
t
:
you
are
quite
a
product
of
civilization
,
"
said
jude
,
a
recollection
of
her
engagement
reviving
his
soreness
a
little
.
"
indeed
i
am
not
,
jude
.
i
like
reading
and
all
that
,
but
i
crave
to
get
back
to
the
life
of
my
infancy
and
its
freedom
.
"
"
do
you
remember
it
so
well
?
you
seem
to
me
to
have
nothing
unconventional
at
all
about
you
.
"
"
oh
,
have
not
i
!
you
do
not
know
what
'
s
inside
me
.
"
"
what
?
"
"
the
ishmaelite
.
"
"
an
urban
miss
is
what
you
are
.
"
she
looked
severe
disagreement
,
and
turned
away
.
the
shepherd
aroused
them
the
next
morning
,
as
he
had
said
.
it
was
bright
and
clear
,
and
the
four
miles
to
the
train
were
accomplished
pleasantly
.
when
they
had
reached
melchester
,
and
walked
to
the
close
,
and
the
gables
of
the
old
building
in
which
she
was
again
to
be
immured
rose
before
sue
'
s
eyes
,
she
looked
a
little
scared
.
"
i
expect
i
shall
catch
it
!
"
she
murmured
.
they
rang
the
great
bell
and
waited
.
"
oh
,
i
bought
something
for
you
,
which
i
had
nearly
forgotten
,
"
she
said
quickly
,
searching
her
pocket
.
"
it
is
a
new
little
photograph
of
me
.
would
you
like
it
?
"
"
would
i
!
"
he
took
it
gladly
,
and
the
porter
came
.
there
seemed
to
be
an
ominous
glance
on
his
face
when
he
opened
the
gate
.
she
passed
in
,
looking
back
at
jude
,
and
waving
her
hand
.
the
seventy
young
women
,
of
ages
varying
in
the
main
from
nineteen
to
one
-
and
-
twenty
,
though
several
were
older
,
who
at
this
date
filled
the
species
of
nunnery
known
as
the
training
-
school
at
melchester
,
formed
a
very
mixed
community
,
which
included
the
daughters
of
mechanics
,
curates
,
surgeons
,
shopkeepers
,
farmers
,
dairy
-
men
,
soldiers
,
sailors
,
and
villagers
.
they
sat
in
the
large
school
-
room
of
the
establishment
on
the
evening
previously
described
,
and
word
was
passed
round
that
sue
bridehead
had
not
come
in
at
closing
-
time
.
"
she
went
out
with
her
young
man
,
"
said
a
second
-
year
'
s
student
,
who
knew
about
young
men
.
"
and
miss
traceley
saw
her
at
the
station
with
him
.
she
will
have
it
hot
when
she
does
come
.
"
"
she
said
he
was
her
cousin
,
"
observed
a
youthful
new
girl
.
"
that
excuse
has
been
made
a
little
too
often
in
this
school
to
be
effectual
in
saving
our
souls
,
"
said
the
head
girl
of
the
year
,
drily
.
the
fact
was
that
,
only
twelve
months
before
,
there
had
occurred
a
lamentable
seduction
of
one
of
the
pupils
who
had
made
the
same
statement
in
order
to
gain
meetings
with
her
lover
.
the
affair
had
created
a
scandal
,
and
the
management
had
consequently
been
rough
on
cousins
ever
since
.
at
nine
o
'
clock
the
names
were
called
,
sue
'
s
being
pronounced
three
times
sonorously
by
miss
traceley
without
eliciting
an
answer
.
at
a
quarter
past
nine
the
seventy
stood
up
to
sing
the
"
evening
hymn
,
"
and
then
knelt
down
to
prayers
.
after
prayers
they
went
in
to
supper
,
and
every
girl
'
s
thought
was
,
where
is
sue
bridehead
?
some
of
the
students
,
who
had
seen
jude
from
the
window
,
felt
that
they
would
not
mind
risking
her
punishment
for
the
pleasure
of
being
kissed
by
such
a
kindly
-
faced
young
men
.
hardly
one
among
them
believed
in
the
cousinship
.
half
an
hour
later
they
all
lay
in
their
cubicles
,
their
tender
feminine
faces
upturned
to
the
flaring
gas
-
jets
which
at
intervals
stretched
down
the
long
dormitories
,
every
face
bearing
the
legend
"
the
weaker
"
upon
it
,
as
the
penalty
of
the
sex
wherein
they
were
moulded
,
which
by
no
possible
exertion
of
their
willing
hearts
and
abilities
could
be
made
strong
while
the
inexorable
laws
of
nature
remain
what
they
are
.
they
formed
a
pretty
,
suggestive
,
pathetic
sight
,
of
whose
pathos
and
beauty
they
were
themselves
unconscious
,
and
would
not
discover
till
,
amid
the
storms
and
strains
of
after
-
years
,
with
their
injustice
,
loneliness
,
child
-
bearing
,
and
bereavement
,
their
minds
would
revert
to
this
experience
as
to
something
which
had
been
allowed
to
slip
past
them
insufficiently
regarded
.
one
of
the
mistresses
came
in
to
turn
out
the
lights
,
and
before
doing
so
gave
a
final
glance
at
sue
'
s
cot
,
which
remained
empty
,
and
at
her
little
dressing
-
table
at
the
foot
,
which
,
like
all
the
rest
,
was
ornamented
with
various
girlish
trifles
,
framed
photographs
being
not
the
least
conspicuous
among
them
.
sue
'
s
table
had
a
moderate
show
,
two
men
in
their
filigree
and
velvet
frames
standing
together
beside
her
looking
-
glass
.
"
who
are
these
men
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
did
she
ever
say
?
"
asked
the
mistress
.
"
strictly
speaking
,
relations
'
portraits
only
are
allowed
on
these
tables
,
you
know
.
"
"
one
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
middle
-
aged
man
,
"
said
a
student
in
the
next
bed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
is
the
schoolmaster
she
served
under
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
mr
phillotson
.
"
"
and
the
other
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
this
undergraduate
in
cap
and
gown
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
who
is
he
?
"
"
he
is
a
friend
,
or
was
.
she
has
never
told
his
name
.
"
"
was
it
either
of
these
two
who
came
for
her
?
"
"
no
.
"
"
you
are
sure
'
twas
not
the
undergraduate
?
"
"
quite
.
he
was
a
young
man
with
a
black
beard
.
"
the
lights
were
promptly
extinguished
,
and
till
they
fell
asleep
the
girls
indulged
in
conjectures
about
sue
,
and
wondered
what
games
she
had
carried
on
in
london
and
at
christminster
before
she
came
here
,
some
of
the
more
restless
ones
getting
out
of
bed
and
looking
from
the
mullioned
windows
at
the
vast
west
front
of
the
cathedral
opposite
,
and
the
spire
rising
behind
it
.
when
they
awoke
the
next
morning
they
glanced
into
sue
'
s
nook
,
to
find
it
still
without
a
tenant
.
after
the
early
lessons
by
gas
-
light
,
in
half
-
toilet
,
and
when
they
had
come
up
to
dress
for
breakfast
,
the
bell
of
the
entrance
gate
was
heard
to
ring
loudly
.
the
mistress
of
the
dormitory
went
away
,
and
presently
came
back
to
say
that
the
principal
'
s
orders
were
that
nobody
was
to
speak
to
bridehead
without
permission
.
when
,
accordingly
,
sue
came
into
the
dormitory
to
hastily
tidy
herself
,
looking
flushed
and
tired
,
she
went
to
her
cubicle
in
silence
,
none
of
them
coming
out
to
greet
her
or
to
make
inquiry
.
when
they
had
gone
downstairs
they
found
that
she
did
not
follow
them
into
the
dining
-
hall
to
breakfast
,
and
they
then
learnt
that
she
had
been
severely
reprimanded
,
and
ordered
to
a
solitary
room
for
a
week
,
there
to
be
confined
,
and
take
her
meals
,
and
do
all
her
reading
.
at
this
the
seventy
murmured
,
the
sentence
being
,
they
thought
,
too
severe
.
a
round
robin
was
prepared
and
sent
in
to
the
principal
,
asking
for
a
remission
of
sue
'
s
punishment
.
no
notice
was
taken
.
towards
evening
,
when
the
geography
mistress
began
dictating
her
subject
,
the
girls
in
the
class
sat
with
folded
arms
.
"
you
mean
that
you
are
not
going
to
work
?
"
said
the
mistress
at
last
.
"
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
it
has
been
ascertained
that
the
young
man
bridehead
stayed
out
with
was
not
her
cousin
,
for
the
very
good
reason
that
she
has
no
such
relative
.
we
have
written
to
christminster
to
ascertain
.
"
"
we
are
willing
to
take
her
word
,
"
said
the
head
girl
.
"
this
young
man
was
discharged
from
his
work
at
christminster
for
drunkenness
and
blasphemy
in
public
-
houses
,
and
he
has
come
here
to
live
,
entirely
to
be
near
her
.
"
however
,
they
remained
stolid
and
motionless
,
and
the
mistress
left
the
room
to
inquire
from
her
superiors
what
was
to
be
done
.
presently
,
towards
dusk
,
the
pupils
,
as
they
sat
,
heard
exclamations
from
the
first
-
year
'
s
girls
in
an
adjoining
classroom
,
and
one
rushed
in
to
say
that
sue
bridehead
had
got
out
of
the
back
window
of
the
room
in
which
she
had
been
confined
,
escaped
in
the
dark
across
the
lawn
,
and
disappeared
.
how
she
had
managed
to
get
out
of
the
garden
nobody
could
tell
,
as
it
was
bounded
by
the
river
at
the
bottom
,
and
the
side
door
was
locked
.
they
went
and
looked
at
the
empty
room
,
the
casement
between
the
middle
mullions
of
which
stood
open
.
the
lawn
was
again
searched
with
a
lantern
,
every
bush
and
shrub
being
examined
,
but
she
was
nowhere
hidden
.
then
the
porter
of
the
front
gate
was
interrogated
,
and
on
reflection
he
said
that
he
remembered
hearing
a
sort
of
splashing
in
the
stream
at
the
back
,
but
he
had
taken
no
notice
,
thinking
some
ducks
had
come
down
the
river
