up
to
this
point
,
though
he
had
seen
enough
to
shew
him
the
main
drift
of
the
great
changes
that
had
taken
place
in
erewhonian
opinions
,
my
father
had
not
been
able
to
glean
much
about
the
history
of
the
transformation
.
he
could
see
that
it
had
all
grown
out
of
the
supposed
miracle
of
his
balloon
ascent
,
and
he
could
understand
that
the
ignorant
masses
had
been
so
astounded
by
an
event
so
contrary
to
all
their
experience
,
that
their
faith
in
experience
was
utterly
routed
and
demoralised
.
it
a
man
and
a
woman
might
rise
from
the
earth
and
disappear
into
the
sky
,
what
else
might
not
happen
?
if
they
had
been
wrong
in
thinking
such
a
thing
impossible
,
in
how
much
else
might
they
not
be
mistaken
also
?
the
ground
was
shaken
under
their
very
feet
.
he
could
understand
that
a
single
incontrovertible
miracle
of
the
first
magnitude
should
uproot
the
hedges
of
caution
in
the
minds
of
the
common
people
,
but
he
could
not
understand
how
such
men
as
hanky
and
panky
,
who
evidently
did
not
believe
that
there
had
been
any
miracle
at
all
,
had
been
led
to
throw
themselves
so
energetically
into
a
movement
so
subversive
of
all
their
traditions
,
when
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
,
if
they
had
held
out
they
might
have
pricked
the
balloon
bubble
easily
enough
,
and
maintained
everything
in
statu
quo
.
how
,
again
,
had
they
converted
the
king
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
if
they
had
converted
him
?
the
queen
had
had
full
knowledge
of
all
the
preparations
for
the
ascent
.
the
king
had
had
everything
explained
to
him
.
the
workmen
and
workwomen
who
had
made
the
balloon
and
the
gas
could
testify
that
none
but
natural
means
had
been
made
use
of
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
means
which
,
if
again
employed
any
number
of
times
,
would
effect
a
like
result
.
how
could
it
be
that
when
the
means
of
resistance
were
so
ample
and
so
easy
,
the
movement
should
nevertheless
have
been
irresistible
?
for
had
it
not
been
irresistible
,
was
it
to
be
believed
that
astute
men
like
hanky
and
panky
would
have
let
themselves
be
drawn
into
it
?
what
then
had
been
its
inner
history
?
my
father
had
so
fully
determined
to
make
his
way
back
on
the
following
evening
,
that
he
saw
no
chance
of
getting
to
know
the
facts
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
unless
,
indeed
,
he
should
be
able
to
learn
something
from
hanky
'
s
sermon
;
he
was
therefore
not
sorry
to
find
an
elderly
gentleman
of
grave
but
kindly
aspect
seated
opposite
to
him
when
he
sat
down
to
supper
.
the
expression
on
this
man
'
s
face
was
much
like
that
of
the
early
christians
as
shewn
in
the
s
.
giovanni
laterano
bas
-
reliefs
at
rome
,
and
again
,
though
less
aggressively
self
-
confident
,
like
that
on
the
faces
of
those
who
have
joined
the
salvation
army
.
if
he
had
been
in
england
,
my
father
would
have
set
him
down
as
a
swedenborgian
;
this
being
impossible
,
he
could
only
note
that
the
stranger
bowed
his
head
,
evidently
saying
a
short
grace
before
he
began
to
eat
,
as
my
father
had
always
done
when
he
was
in
erewhon
before
.
i
will
not
say
that
my
father
had
never
omitted
to
say
grace
during
the
whole
of
the
last
twenty
years
,
but
he
said
it
now
,
and
unfortunately
forgetting
himself
,
he
said
it
in
the
english
language
,
not
loud
,
but
nevertheless
audibly
.
my
father
was
alarmed
at
what
he
had
done
,
but
there
was
no
need
,
for
the
stranger
immediately
said
,
"
i
hear
,
sir
,
that
you
have
the
gift
of
tongues
.
the
sunchild
often
mentioned
it
to
us
,
as
having
been
vouchsafed
long
since
to
certain
of
the
people
,
to
whom
,
for
our
learning
,
he
saw
fit
to
feign
that
he
belonged
.
he
thus
foreshadowed
prophetically
its
manifestation
also
among
ourselves
.
all
which
,
however
,
you
must
know
as
well
as
i
do
.
can
you
interpret
?
"
my
father
was
much
shocked
,
but
he
remembered
having
frequently
spoken
of
the
power
of
speaking
in
unknown
tongues
which
was
possessed
by
many
of
the
early
christians
,
and
he
also
remembered
that
in
times
of
high
religious
enthusiasm
this
power
had
repeatedly
been
imparted
,
or
supposed
to
be
imparted
,
to
devout
believers
in
the
middle
ages
.
it
grated
upon
him
to
deceive
one
who
was
so
obviously
sincere
,
but
to
avoid
immediate
discomfiture
he
fell
in
with
what
the
stranger
had
said
.
"
alas
!
sir
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
rarer
and
more
precious
gift
has
been
withheld
from
me
;
nor
can
i
speak
in
an
unknown
tongue
,
unless
as
it
is
borne
in
upon
me
at
the
moment
.
i
could
not
even
repeat
the
words
that
have
just
fallen
from
me
.
"
"
that
,
"
replied
the
stranger
,
"
is
almost
invariably
the
case
.
these
illuminations
of
the
spirit
are
beyond
human
control
.
you
spoke
in
so
low
a
tone
that
i
cannot
interpret
what
you
have
just
said
,
but
should
you
receive
a
second
inspiration
later
,
i
shall
doubtless
be
able
to
interpret
it
for
you
.
i
have
been
singularly
gifted
in
this
respect
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
more
so
,
perhaps
,
than
any
other
interpreter
in
erewhon
.
"
my
father
mentally
vowed
that
no
second
inspiration
should
be
vouchsafed
to
him
,
but
presently
remembering
how
anxious
he
was
for
information
on
the
points
touched
upon
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
,
and
seeing
that
fortune
had
sent
him
the
kind
of
man
who
would
be
able
to
enlighten
him
,
he
changed
his
mind
;
nothing
,
he
reflected
,
would
be
more
likely
to
make
the
stranger
talk
freely
with
him
,
than
the
affording
him
an
opportunity
for
showing
off
his
skill
as
an
interpreter
.
something
,
therefore
,
he
would
say
,
but
what
?
no
one
could
talk
more
freely
when
the
train
of
his
thoughts
,
or
the
conversation
of
others
,
gave
him
his
cue
,
but
when
told
to
say
an
unattached
"
something
,
"
he
could
not
even
think
of
"
how
do
you
do
this
morning
?
it
is
a
very
fine
day
;
"
and
the
more
he
cudgelled
his
brains
for
"
something
,
"
the
more
they
gave
no
response
.
he
could
not
even
converse
further
with
the
stranger
beyond
plain
"
yes
"
and
"
no
"
;
so
he
went
on
with
his
supper
,
and
in
thinking
of
what
he
was
eating
and
drinking
for
the
moment
forgot
to
ransack
his
brain
.
no
sooner
had
he
left
off
ransacking
it
,
than
it
suggested
something
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
not
,
indeed
,
a
very
brilliant
something
,
but
still
something
.
on
having
grasped
it
,
he
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
with
the
air
of
one
distraught
he
said
-
"
my
name
is
norval
,
on
the
grampian
hills
my
father
feeds
his
flock
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
frugal
swain
.
"
"
i
heard
you
,
"
exclaimed
the
stranger
,
"
and
i
can
interpret
every
word
of
what
you
have
said
,
but
it
would
not
become
me
to
do
so
,
for
you
have
conveyed
to
me
a
message
more
comforting
than
i
can
bring
myself
to
repeat
even
to
him
who
has
conveyed
it
.
"
having
said
this
he
bowed
his
head
,
and
remained
for
some
time
wrapped
in
meditation
.
my
father
kept
a
respectful
silence
,
but
after
a
little
time
he
ventured
to
say
in
a
low
tone
,
how
glad
he
was
to
have
been
the
medium
through
whom
a
comforting
assurance
had
been
conveyed
.
presently
,
on
finding
himself
encouraged
to
renew
the
conversation
,
he
threw
out
a
deferential
feeler
as
to
the
causes
that
might
have
induced
mr
balmy
to
come
to
fairmead
.
"
perhaps
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
,
like
myself
,
have
come
to
these
parts
in
order
to
see
the
dedication
of
the
new
temple
;
i
could
not
get
a
lodging
in
sunch
'
ston
,
so
i
walked
down
here
this
morning
.
"
this
,
it
seemed
,
had
been
mr
balmy
'
s
own
case
,
except
that
he
had
not
yet
been
to
sunch
'
ston
.
having
heard
that
it
was
full
to
overflowing
,
he
had
determined
to
pass
the
night
at
fairmead
,
and
walk
over
in
the
morning
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
starting
soon
after
seven
,
so
as
to
arrive
in
good
time
for
the
dedication
ceremony
.
when
my
father
heard
this
,
he
proposed
that
they
should
walk
together
,
to
which
mr
balmy
gladly
consented
;
it
was
therefore
arranged
that
they
should
go
to
bed
early
,
breakfast
soon
after
six
,
and
then
walk
to
sunch
'
ston
.
my
father
then
went
to
his
own
room
,
where
he
again
smoked
a
surreptitious
pipe
up
the
chimney
.
next
morning
the
two
men
breakfasted
together
,
and
set
out
as
the
clock
was
striking
seven
.
the
day
was
lovely
beyond
the
power
of
words
,
and
still
fresh
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
fairmead
was
some
2500
feet
above
the
sea
,
and
the
sun
did
not
get
above
the
mountains
that
overhung
it
on
the
east
side
,
till
after
eight
o
'
clock
.
many
persons
were
also
starting
for
sunch
'
ston
,
and
there
was
a
procession
got
up
by
the
musical
bank
managers
of
the
town
,
who
walked
in
it
,
robed
in
rich
dresses
of
scarlet
and
white
embroidered
with
much
gold
thread
.
there
was
a
banner
displaying
an
open
chariot
in
which
the
sunchild
and
his
bride
were
seated
,
beaming
with
smiles
,
and
in
attitudes
suggesting
that
they
were
bowing
to
people
who
were
below
them
.
the
chariot
was
,
of
course
,
drawn
by
the
four
black
and
white
horses
of
which
the
reader
has
already
heard
,
and
the
balloon
had
been
ignored
.
readers
of
my
father
'
s
book
will
perhaps
remember
that
my
mother
was
not
seen
at
all
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
she
was
smuggled
into
the
car
of
the
balloon
along
with
sundry
rugs
,
under
which
she
lay
concealed
till
the
balloon
had
left
the
earth
.
all
this
went
for
nothing
.
it
has
been
said
that
though
god
cannot
alter
the
past
,
historians
can
;
it
is
perhaps
because
they
can
be
useful
to
him
in
this
respect
that
he
tolerates
their
existence
.
painters
,
my
father
now
realised
,
can
do
all
that
historians
can
,
with
even
greater
effect
.
women
headed
the
procession
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
younger
ones
dressed
in
white
,
with
veils
and
chaplets
of
roses
,
blue
cornflower
,
and
pheasant
'
s
eye
narcissus
,
while
the
older
women
were
more
soberly
attired
.
the
bank
managers
and
the
banner
headed
the
men
,
who
were
mostly
peasants
,
but
among
them
were
a
few
who
seemed
to
be
of
higher
rank
,
and
these
,
for
the
most
part
,
though
by
no
means
all
of
them
,
wore
their
clothes
reversed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
i
have
forgotten
to
say
was
done
also
by
mr
balmy
.
both
men
and
women
joined
in
singing
a
litany
the
words
of
which
my
father
could
not
catch
;
the
tune
was
one
he
had
been
used
to
play
on
his
apology
for
a
flute
when
he
was
in
prison
,
being
,
in
fact
,
none
other
than
"
home
,
sweet
home
.
"
there
was
no
harmony
;
they
never
got
beyond
the
first
four
bars
,
but
these
they
must
have
repeated
,
my
father
thought
,
at
least
a
hundred
times
between
fairmead
and
sunch
'
ston
.
"
well
,
"
said
he
to
himself
,
"
however
little
else
i
may
have
taught
them
,
i
at
any
rate
gave
them
the
diatonic
scale
.
"
he
now
set
himself
to
exploit
his
fellow
-
traveller
,
for
they
soon
got
past
the
procession
.
"
the
greatest
miracle
,
"
said
he
,
"
in
connection
with
this
whole
matter
,
has
been
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
so
at
least
it
seems
to
me
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
not
the
ascent
of
the
sunchild
with
his
bride
,
but
the
readiness
with
which
the
people
generally
acknowledged
its
miraculous
character
.
i
was
one
of
those
that
witnessed
the
ascent
,
but
i
saw
no
signs
that
the
crowd
appreciated
its
significance
.
they
were
astounded
,
but
they
did
not
fall
down
and
worship
.
"
"
ah
,
"
said
the
other
,
"
but
you
forget
the
long
drought
and
the
rain
that
the
sunchild
immediately
prevailed
on
the
air
-
god
to
send
us
.
he
had
announced
himself
as
about
to
procure
it
for
us
;
it
was
on
this
ground
that
the
king
assented
to
the
preparation
of
those
material
means
that
were
necessary
before
the
horses
of
the
sun
could
attach
themselves
to
the
chariot
into
which
the
balloon
was
immediately
transformed
.
those
horses
might
not
be
defiled
by
contact
with
this
gross
earth
.
i
too
witnessed
the
ascent
;
at
the
moment
,
i
grant
you
,
i
saw
neither
chariot
nor
horses
,
and
almost
all
those
present
shared
my
own
temporary
blindness
;
the
whole
action
from
the
moment
when
the
balloon
left
the
earth
,
moved
so
rapidly
,
that
we
were
flustered
,
and
hardly
knew
what
it
was
that
we
were
really
seeing
.
it
was
not
till
two
or
three
years
later
that
i
found
the
scene
presenting
itself
to
my
soul
'
s
imaginary
sight
in
the
full
splendour
which
was
no
doubt
witnessed
,
but
not
apprehended
,
by
my
bodily
vision
.
"
"
there
,
"
said
my
father
,
"
you
confirm
an
opinion
that
i
have
long
held
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
nothing
is
so
misleading
as
the
testimony
of
eye
-
witnesses
.
"
"
a
spiritual
enlightenment
from
within
,
"
returned
mr
balmy
,
"
is
more
to
be
relied
on
than
any
merely
physical
affluence
from
external
objects
.
now
,
when
i
shut
my
eyes
,
i
see
the
balloon
ascend
a
little
way
,
but
almost
immediately
the
heavens
open
,
the
horses
descend
,
the
balloon
is
transformed
,
and
the
glorious
pageant
careers
onward
till
it
vanishes
into
the
heaven
of
heavens
.
hundreds
with
whom
i
have
conversed
assure
me
that
their
experience
has
been
the
same
as
mine
.
has
yours
been
different
?
"
"
oh
no
,
not
at
all
;
but
i
always
see
some
storks
circling
round
the
balloon
before
i
see
any
horses
.
"
"
how
strange
!
i
have
heard
others
also
say
that
they
saw
the
storks
you
mention
;
but
let
me
do
my
utmost
i
cannot
force
them
into
my
mental
image
of
the
scene
.
this
shows
,
as
you
were
saying
just
now
,
how
incomplete
the
testimony
of
an
eye
-
witness
often
is
.
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
storks
were
there
,
but
the
horses
and
the
chariot
have
impressed
themselves
more
vividly
on
my
mind
than
anything
else
has
.
"
"
quite
so
;
and
i
am
not
without
hope
that
even
at
this
late
hour
some
further
details
may
yet
be
revealed
to
us
.
"
"
it
is
possible
,
but
we
should
be
as
cautious
in
accepting
any
fresh
details
as
in
rejecting
them
.
should
some
heresy
obtain
wide
acceptance
,
visions
will
perhaps
be
granted
to
us
that
may
be
useful
in
refuting
it
,
but
otherwise
i
expect
nothing
more
.
"
"
neither
do
i
,
but
i
have
heard
people
say
that
inasmuch
as
the
sunchild
said
he
was
going
to
interview
the
air
-
god
in
order
to
send
us
rain
,
he
was
more
probably
son
to
the
air
-
god
than
to
the
sun
.
now
here
is
a
heresy
which
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
but
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
said
mr
balmy
,
interrupting
him
with
great
warmth
,
"
he
spoke
of
his
father
in
heaven
as
endowed
with
attributes
far
exceeding
any
that
can
be
conceivably
ascribed
to
the
air
-
god
.
the
power
of
the
air
-
god
does
not
extend
beyond
our
own
atmosphere
.
"
"
pray
believe
me
,
"
said
my
father
,
who
saw
by
the
ecstatic
gleam
in
his
companion
'
s
eye
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
agree
with
him
,
"
that
i
accept
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
hear
me
to
the
end
,
"
replied
mr
balmy
.
"
who
ever
heard
the
sunchild
claim
relationship
with
the
air
-
god
?
he
could
command
the
air
-
god
,
and
evidently
did
so
,
halting
no
doubt
for
this
beneficent
purpose
on
his
journey
towards
his
ultimate
destination
.
can
we
suppose
that
the
air
-
god
,
who
had
evidently
intended
withholding
the
rain
from
us
for
an
indefinite
period
,
should
have
so
immediately
relinquished
his
designs
against
us
at
the
intervention
of
any
less
exalted
personage
than
the
sun
'
s
own
offspring
?
impossible
!
"
"
i
quite
agree
with
you
,
"
exclaimed
my
father
,
"
it
is
out
of
the
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
let
me
finish
what
i
have
to
say
.
when
the
rain
came
so
copiously
for
days
,
even
those
who
had
not
seen
the
miraculous
ascent
found
its
consequences
come
so
directly
home
to
them
,
that
they
had
no
difficulty
in
accepting
the
report
of
others
.
there
was
not
a
farmer
or
cottager
in
the
land
but
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
at
rescue
from
impending
ruin
,
and
they
all
knew
it
was
the
sunchild
who
had
promised
the
king
that
he
would
make
the
air
-
god
send
it
.
so
abundantly
,
you
will
remember
,
did
it
come
,
that
we
had
to
pray
to
him
to
stop
it
,
which
in
his
own
good
time
he
was
pleased
to
do
.
"
"
i
remember
,
"
said
my
father
,
who
was
at
last
able
to
edge
in
a
word
,
"
that
it
nearly
flooded
me
out
of
house
and
home
.
and
yet
,
in
spite
of
all
this
,
i
hear
that
there
are
many
at
bridgeford
who
are
still
hardened
unbelievers
.
"
"
alas
!
you
speak
too
truly
.
bridgeford
and
the
musical
banks
for
the
first
three
years
fought
tooth
and
nail
to
blind
those
whom
it
was
their
first
duty
to
enlighten
.
i
was
a
professor
of
the
hypothetical
language
,
and
you
may
perhaps
remember
how
i
was
driven
from
my
chair
on
account
of
the
fearlessness
with
which
i
expounded
the
deeper
mysteries
of
sunchildism
.
"
"
yes
,
i
remember
well
how
cruelly
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
but
my
father
was
not
allowed
to
get
beyond
"
cruelly
.
"
"
it
was
i
who
explained
why
the
sunchild
had
represented
himself
as
belonging
to
a
people
in
many
respects
analogous
to
our
own
,
when
no
such
people
can
have
existed
.
it
was
i
who
detected
that
the
supposed
nation
spoken
of
by
the
sunchild
was
an
invention
designed
in
order
to
give
us
instruction
by
the
light
of
which
we
might
more
easily
remodel
our
institutions
.
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
my
gift
of
interpretation
was
vouchsafed
to
me
in
recognition
of
the
humble
services
that
i
was
hereby
allowed
to
render
.
by
the
way
,
you
have
received
no
illumination
this
morning
,
have
you
?
"
"
i
never
do
,
sir
,
when
i
am
in
the
company
of
one
whose
conversation
i
find
supremely
interesting
.
but
you
were
telling
me
about
bridgeford
:
i
live
hundreds
of
miles
from
bridgeford
,
and
have
never
understood
the
suddenness
,
and
completeness
,
with
which
men
like
professors
hanky
and
panky
and
dr
downie
changed
front
.
do
they
believe
as
you
and
i
do
,
or
did
they
merely
go
with
the
times
?
i
spent
a
couple
of
hours
with
hanky
and
panky
only
two
evenings
ago
,
and
was
not
so
much
impressed
as
i
could
have
wished
with
the
depth
of
their
religious
fervour
.
"
"
they
are
sincere
now
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
more
especially
hanky
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
i
cannot
think
i
am
judging
them
harshly
,
if
i
say
that
they
were
not
so
at
first
.
even
now
,
i
fear
,
that
they
are
more
carnally
than
spiritually
minded
.
see
how
they
have
fought
for
the
aggrandisement
of
their
own
order
.
it
is
mainly
their
doing
that
the
musical
banks
have
usurped
the
spiritual
authority
formerly
exercised
by
the
straighteners
.
"
"
but
the
straighteners
,
"
said
my
father
,
"
could
not
co
-
exist
with
sunchildism
,
and
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
claims
of
the
banks
can
be
reasonably
gainsaid
.
"
"
perhaps
;
and
after
all
the
banks
are
our
main
bulwark
against
the
evils
that
i
fear
will
follow
from
the
repeal
of
the
laws
against
machinery
.
this
has
already
led
to
the
development
of
a
materialism
which
minimizes
the
miraculous
element
in
the
sunchild
'
s
ascent
,
as
our
own
people
minimize
the
material
means
that
were
the
necessary
prologue
to
the
miraculous
.
"
thus
did
they
converse
;
but
i
will
not
pursue
their
conversation
further
.
it
will
be
enough
to
say
that
in
further
floods
of
talk
mr
balmy
confirmed
what
george
had
said
about
the
banks
having
lost
their
hold
upon
the
masses
.
that
hold
was
weak
even
in
the
time
of
my
father
'
s
first
visit
;
but
when
the
people
saw
the
hostility
of
the
banks
to
a
movement
which
far
the
greater
number
of
them
accepted
,
it
seemed
as
though
both
bridgeford
and
the
banks
were
doomed
,
for
bridgeford
was
heart
and
soul
with
the
banks
.
hanky
,
it
appeared
,
though
under
thirty
,
and
not
yet
a
professor
,
grasped
the
situation
,
and
saw
that
bridgeford
must
either
move
with
the
times
,
or
go
.
he
consulted
some
of
the
most
sagacious
heads
of
houses
and
professors
,
with
the
result
that
a
committee
of
enquiry
was
appointed
,
which
in
due
course
reported
that
the
evidence
for
the
sunchild
'
s
having
been
the
only
child
of
the
sun
was
conclusive
.
it
was
about
this
time
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
is
to
say
some
three
years
after
his
ascent
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
"
higgsism
,
"
as
it
had
been
hitherto
called
,
became
"
sunchildism
,
"
and
"
higgs
"
the
"
sunchild
.
"
my
father
also
learned
the
king
'
s
fury
at
his
escape
(
for
he
would
call
it
nothing
else
)
with
my
mother
.
this
was
so
great
that
though
he
had
hitherto
been
,
and
had
ever
since
proved
himself
to
be
,
a
humane
ruler
,
he
ordered
the
instant
execution
of
all
who
had
been
concerned
in
making
either
the
gas
or
the
balloon
;
and
his
cruel
orders
were
carried
out
within
a
couple
of
hours
.
at
the
same
time
he
ordered
the
destruction
by
fire
of
the
queen
'
s
workshops
,
and
of
all
remnants
of
any
materials
used
in
making
the
balloon
.
it
is
said
the
queen
was
so
much
grieved
and
outraged
(
for
it
was
her
doing
that
the
material
ground
-
work
,
so
to
speak
,
had
been
provided
for
the
miracle
)
that
she
wept
night
and
day
without
ceasing
three
whole
months
,
and
never
again
allowed
her
husband
to
embrace
her
,
till
he
had
also
embraced
sunchildism
.
when
the
rain
came
,
public
indignation
at
the
king
'
s
action
was
raised
almost
to
revolution
pitch
,
and
the
king
was
frightened
at
once
by
the
arrival
of
the
promised
downfall
and
the
displeasure
of
his
subjects
.
but
he
still
held
out
,
and
it
was
only
after
concessions
on
the
part
of
the
bridgeford
committee
,
that
he
at
last
consented
to
the
absorption
of
sunchildism
into
the
musical
bank
system
,
and
to
its
establishment
as
the
religion
of
the
country
.
the
far
-
reaching
changes
in
erewhonian
institutions
with
which
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
.
"
i
know
the
difficulty
,
"
said
my
father
presently
,
"
with
which
the
king
was
persuaded
to
allow
the
way
in
which
the
sunchild
'
s
dress
should
be
worn
to
be
a
matter
of
opinion
,
not
dogma
.
i
see
we
have
adopted
different
fashions
.
have
you
any
decided
opinions
upon
the
subject
?
"
"
i
have
;
but
i
will
ask
you
not
to
press
me
for
them
.
let
this
matter
remain
as
the
king
has
left
it
.
"
my
father
thought
that
he
might
now
venture
on
a
shot
.
so
he
said
,
"
i
have
always
understood
,
too
,
that
the
king
forced
the
repeal
of
the
laws
against
machinery
on
the
bridgeford
committee
,
as
another
condition
of
his
assent
?
"
"
certainly
.
he
insisted
on
this
,
partly
to
gratify
the
queen
,
who
had
not
yet
forgiven
him
,
and
who
had
set
her
heart
on
having
a
watch
,
and
partly
because
he
expected
that
a
development
of
the
country
'
s
resources
,
in
consequence
of
a
freer
use
of
machinery
,
would
bring
more
money
into
his
exchequer
.
bridgeford
fought
hard
and
wisely
here
,
but
they
had
gained
so
much
by
the
musical
bank
managers
being
recognised
as
the
authorised
exponents
of
sunchildism
,
that
they
thought
it
wise
to
yield
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
apparently
with
a
good
grace
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
thus
gild
the
pill
which
his
majesty
was
about
to
swallow
.
but
even
then
they
feared
the
consequences
that
are
already
beginning
to
appear
,
all
which
,
if
i
mistake
not
,
will
assume
far
more
serious
proportions
in
the
future
.
"
"
see
,
"
said
my
father
suddenly
,
"
we
are
coming
to
another
procession
,
and
they
have
got
some
banners
,
let
us
walk
a
little
quicker
and
overtake
it
.
"
"
horrible
!
"
replied
mr
balmy
fiercely
.
"
you
must
be
short
-
sighted
,
or
you
could
never
have
called
my
attention
to
it
.
let
us
get
it
behind
us
as
fast
as
possible
,
and
not
so
much
as
look
at
it
.
"
"
oh
yes
,
yes
,
"
said
my
father
,
"
it
is
indeed
horrible
,
i
had
not
seen
what
it
was
.
"
he
had
not
the
faintest
idea
what
the
matter
was
,
but
he
let
mr
balmy
walk
a
little
ahead
of
him
,
so
that
he
could
see
the
banners
,
the
most
important
of
which
he
found
to
display
a
balloon
pure
and
simple
,
with
one
figure
in
the
car
.
true
,
at
the
top
of
the
banner
there
was
a
smudge
which
might
be
taken
for
a
little
chariot
,
and
some
very
little
horses
,
but
the
balloon
was
the
only
thing
insisted
on
.
as
for
the
procession
,
it
consisted
entirely
of
men
,
whom
a
smaller
banner
announced
to
be
workmen
from
the
fairmead
iron
and
steel
works
.
there
was
a
third
banner
,
which
said
,
"
science
as
well
as
sunchildism
.
"
"
it
is
enough
to
break
one
'
s
heart
,
"
said
mr
balmy
when
he
had
outstripped
the
procession
,
and
my
father
was
again
beside
him
.
"
'
as
well
as
,
'
indeed
!
we
know
what
that
means
.
wherever
there
is
a
factory
there
is
a
hot
-
bed
of
unbelief
.
'
as
well
as
'
!
why
it
is
a
defiance
.
"
"
what
,
i
wonder
,
"
said
my
father
innocently
,
"
must
the
sunchild
'
s
feelings
be
,
as
he
looks
down
on
this
procession
.
for
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
he
is
doing
so
.
"
"
there
can
be
no
doubt
at
all
,
"
replied
mr
balmy
,
"
that
he
is
taking
note
of
it
,
and
of
all
else
that
is
happening
this
day
in
erewhon
.
heaven
grant
that
he
be
not
so
angered
as
to
chastise
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
.
"
"
i
doubt
,
"
said
my
father
,
"
his
being
so
angry
even
with
this
procession
,
as
you
think
he
is
.
"
here
,
fearing
an
outburst
of
indignation
,
he
found
an
excuse
for
rapidly
changing
the
conversation
.
moreover
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
playing
upon
this
poor
good
creature
.
he
had
not
done
so
of
malice
prepense
;
he
had
begun
to
deceive
him
,
because
he
believed
himself
to
be
in
danger
if
he
spoke
the
truth
;
and
though
he
knew
the
part
to
be
an
unworthy
one
,
he
could
not
escape
from
continuing
to
play
it
,
if
he
was
to
discover
things
that
he
was
not
likely
to
discover
otherwise
.
often
,
however
,
he
had
checked
himself
.
it
had
been
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
be
illuminated
with
the
words
,
sukoh
and
sukop
were
two
pretty
men
,
they
lay
in
bed
till
the
clock
struck
ten
,
and
to
follow
it
up
with
,
now
with
the
drops
of
this
most
yknarc
time
my
love
looks
fresh
,
in
order
to
see
how
mr
balmy
would
interpret
the
assertion
here
made
about
the
professors
,
and
what
statement
he
would
connect
with
his
own
erewhonian
name
;
but
he
had
restrained
himself
.
the
more
he
saw
,
and
the
more
he
heard
,
the
more
shocked
he
was
at
the
mischief
he
had
done
.
see
how
he
had
unsettled
the
little
mind
this
poor
,
dear
,
good
gentleman
had
ever
had
,
till
he
was
now
a
mere
slave
to
preconception
.
and
how
many
more
had
he
not
in
like
manner
brought
to
the
verge
of
idiocy
?
how
many
again
had
he
not
made
more
corrupt
than
they
were
before
,
even
though
he
had
not
deceived
them
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
for
example
,
hanky
and
panky
.
and
the
young
?
how
could
such
a
lie
as
that
a
chariot
and
four
horses
came
down
out
of
the
clouds
enter
seriously
into
the
life
of
any
one
,
without
distorting
his
mental
vision
,
if
not
ruining
it
?
and
yet
,
the
more
he
reflected
,
the
more
he
also
saw
that
he
could
do
no
good
by
saying
who
he
was
.
matters
had
gone
so
far
that
though
he
spoke
with
the
tongues
of
men
and
angels
he
would
not
be
listened
to
;
and
even
if
he
were
,
it
might
easily
prove
that
he
had
added
harm
to
that
which
he
had
done
already
.
no
.
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
hanky
'
s
sermon
,
he
would
begin
to
work
his
way
back
,
and
if
the
professors
had
not
yet
removed
their
purchase
,
he
would
recover
it
;
but
he
would
pin
a
bag
containing
about
five
pounds
worth
of
nuggets
on
to
the
tree
in
which
they
had
hidden
it
,
and
,
if
possible
,
he
would
find
some
way
of
sending
the
rest
to
george
.
he
let
mr
balmy
continue
talking
,
glad
that
this
gentleman
required
little
more
than
monosyllabic
answers
,
and
still
more
glad
,
in
spite
of
some
agitation
,
to
see
that
they
were
now
nearing
sunch
'
ston
,
towards
which
a
great
concourse
of
people
was
hurrying
from
clearwater
,
and
more
distant
towns
on
the
main
road
.
many
whole
families
were
coming
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
fathers
and
mothers
carrying
the
smaller
children
,
and
also
their
own
shoes
and
stockings
,
which
they
would
put
on
when
nearing
the
town
.
most
of
the
pilgrims
brought
provisions
with
them
.
all
wore
european
costumes
,
but
only
a
few
of
them
wore
it
reversed
,
and
these
were
almost
invariably
of
higher
social
status
than
the
great
body
of
the
people
,
who
were
mainly
peasants
.
when
they
reached
the
town
,
my
father
was
relieved
at
finding
that
mr
balmy
had
friends
on
whom
he
wished
to
call
before
going
to
the
temple
.
he
asked
my
father
to
come
with
him
,
but
my
father
said
that
he
too
had
friends
,
and
would
leave
him
for
the
present
,
while
hoping
to
meet
him
again
later
in
the
day
.
the
two
,
therefore
,
shook
hands
with
great
effusion
,
and
went
their
several
ways
.
my
father
'
s
way
took
him
first
into
a
confectioner
'
s
shop
,
where
he
bought
a
couple
of
sunchild
buns
,
which
he
put
into
his
pocket
,
and
refreshed
himself
with
a
bottle
of
sunchild
cordial
and
water
.
all
shops
except
those
dealing
in
refreshments
were
closed
,
and
the
town
was
gaily
decorated
with
flags
and
flowers
,
often
festooned
into
words
or
emblems
proper
for
the
occasion
.
my
father
,
it
being
now
a
quarter
to
eleven
,
made
his
way
towards
the
temple
,
and
his
heart
was
clouded
with
care
as
he
walked
along
.
not
only
was
his
heart
clouded
,
but
his
brain
also
was
oppressed
,
and
he
reeled
so
much
on
leaving
the
confectioner
'
s
shop
,
that
he
had
to
catch
hold
of
some
railings
till
the
faintness
and
giddiness
left
him
.
he
knew
the
feeling
to
be
the
same
as
what
he
had
felt
on
the
friday
evening
,
but
he
had
no
idea
of
the
cause
,
and
as
soon
as
the
giddiness
left
him
he
thought
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
him
.
turning
down
a
side
street
that
led
into
the
main
square
of
the
town
,
he
found
himself
opposite
the
south
end
of
the
temple
,
with
its
two
lofty
towers
that
flanked
the
richly
decorated
main
entrance
.
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
the
architecture
,
for
my
father
could
give
me
little
information
on
this
point
.
he
only
saw
the
south
front
for
two
or
three
minutes
,
and
was
not
impressed
by
it
,
save
in
so
far
as
it
was
richly
ornamented
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
evidently
at
great
expense
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
very
large
.
even
if
he
had
had
a
longer
look
,
i
doubt
whether
i
should
have
got
more
out
of
him
,
for
he
knew
nothing
of
architecture
,
and
i
fear
his
test
whether
a
building
was
good
or
bad
,
was
whether
it
looked
old
and
weather
-
beaten
or
no
.
no
matter
what
a
building
was
,
if
it
was
three
or
four
hundred
years
old
he
liked
it
,
whereas
,
if
it
was
new
,
he
would
look
to
nothing
but
whether
it
kept
the
rain
out
.
indeed
i
have
heard
him
say
that
the
mediaeval
sculpture
on
some
of
our
great
cathedrals
often
only
pleases
us
because
time
and
weather
have
set
their
seals
upon
it
,
and
that
if
we
could
see
it
as
it
was
when
it
left
the
mason
'
s
hands
,
we
should
find
it
no
better
than
much
that
is
now
turned
out
in
the
euston
road
.
the
ground
plan
here
given
will

the
reader
to
understand
the
few
following
pages
more
easily

regarded
as
having
any
greater
sanctity
than
the
rest
of
the
temple
.
behind
the
table
,
the
picture
already
spoken
of
was
raised
aloft
.
there
was
no
balloon
;
some
clouds
that
hung
about
the
lower
part
of
the
chariot
served
to
conceal
the
fact
that
the
painter
was
uncertain
whether
it
ought
to
have
wheels
or
no
.
the
horses
were
without
driver
,
and
my
father
thought
that
some
one
ought
to
have
had
them
in
hand
,
for
they
were
in
far
too
excited
a
state
to
be
left
safely
to
themselves
.
they
had
hardly
any
harness
,
but
what
little
there
was
was
enriched
with
gold
bosses
.
my
mother
was
in
erewhonian
costume
,
my
father
in
european
,
but
he
wore
his
clothes
reversed
.
both
he
and
my
mother
seemed
to
be
bowing
graciously
to
an
unseen
crowd
beneath
them
,
and
in
the
distance
,
near
the
bottom
of
the
picture
,
was
a
fairly
accurate
representation
of
the
sunch
'
ston
new
temple
.
high
up
,
on
the
right
hand
,
was
a
disc
,
raised
and
gilt
,
to
represent
the
sun
;
on
it
,
in
low
relief
,
there
was
an
indication
of
a
gorgeous
palace
,
in
which
,
no
doubt
,
the
sun
was
supposed
to
live
;
though
how
they
made
it
all
out
my
father
could
not
conceive
.
space
between
them
,
which
was
partly
occupied
by
the
president
'
s
seat
already
mentioned
.
those
on
the
right
,
as
one
looked
towards
the
apse
,
were
for
the
managers
and
cashiers
of
the
bank
,
while
those
on
the
left
were
for
their
wives
and
daughters
.
as
my
father
was
worming
his
way
among
the
crowd
,
which
was
now
very
dense
,
he
was
startled
at
finding
himself
tapped
lightly
on
the
shoulder
,
and
turning
round
in
alarm
was
confronted
by
the
beaming
face
of
george
.
"
how
do
you
do
,
professor
panky
?
"
said
the
youth
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
who
had
decided
thus
to
address
him
.
"
what
are
you
doing
here
among
the
common
people
?
why
have
you
not
taken
your
place
in
one
of
the
seats
reserved
for
our
distinguished
visitors
?
i
am
afraid
they
must
be
all
full
by
this
time
,
but
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
.
come
with
me
.
"
"
thank
you
,
"
said
my
father
.
his
heart
beat
so
fast
that
this
was
all
he
could
say
,
and
he
followed
meek
as
a
lamb
.
with
some
difficulty
the
two
made
their
way
to
the
right
-
hand
corner
seats
of
block
c
,
for
every
seat
in
the
reserved
block
was
taken
.
the
places
which
george
wanted
for
my
father
and
for
himself
were
already
occupied
by
two
young
men
of
about
eighteen
and
nineteen
,
both
of
them
well
-
grown
,
and
of
prepossessing
appearance
.
my
father
saw
by
the
truncheons
they
carried
that
they
were
special
constables
,
but
he
took
no
notice
of
this
,
for
there
were
many
others
scattered
about
the
crowd
.
george
whispered
a
few
words
to
one
of
them
,
and
to
my
father
'
s
surprise
they
both
gave
up
their
seats
,
which
appear
on
the
plan
as
(
k
)
.
it
afterwards
transpired
that
these
two
young
men
were
george
'
s
brothers
,
who
by
his
desire
had
taken
the
seats
some
hours
ago
,
for
it
was
here
that
george
had
determined
to
place
himself
and
my
father
if
he
could
find
him
.
he
chose
these
places
because
they
would
be
near
enough
to
let
his
mother
(
who
was
at
i
,
in
the
middle
of
the
front
row
of
block
e
,
to
the
left
of
the
pulpit
)
see
my
father
without
being
so
near
as
to
embarrass
him
;
he
could
also
see
and
be
seen
by
hanky
,
and
hear
every
word
of
his
sermon
;
but
perhaps
his
chief
reason
had
been
the
fact
that
they
were
not
far
from
the
side
-
door
at
the
upper
end
of
the
right
-
hand
aisle
,
while
there
was
no
barrier
to
interrupt
rapid
egress
should
this
prove
necessary
.
it
was
now
high
time
that
they
should
sit
down
,
which
they
accordingly
did
.
george
sat
at
the
end
of
the
bench
,
and
thus
had
my
father
on
his
left
.
my
father
was
rather
uncomfortable
at
seeing
the
young
men
whom
they
had
turned
out
,
standing
against
a
column
close
by
,
but
george
said
that
this
was
how
it
was
to
be
,
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
submit
.
the
young
men
seemed
quite
happy
,
which
puzzled
my
father
,
who
of
course
had
no
idea
that
their
action
was
preconcerted
.
panky
was
in
the
first
row
of
block
f
,
so
that
my
father
could
not
see
his
face
except
sometimes
when
he
turned
round
.
he
was
sitting
on
the
mayor
'
s
right
hand
,
while
dr
downie
was
on
his
left
;
he
looked
at
my
father
once
or
twice
in
a
puzzled
way
,
as
though
he
ought
to
have
known
him
,
but
my
father
did
not
think
he
recognised
him
.
hanky
was
still
with
president
gurgoyle
and
others
in
the
robing
-
room
,
n
;
yram
had
already
taken
her
seat
:
my
father
knew
her
in
a
moment
,
though
he
pretended
not
to
do
so
when
george
pointed
her
out
to
him
.
their
eyes
met
for
a
second
;
yram
turned
hers
quickly
away
,
and
my
father
could
not
see
a
trace
of
recognition
in
her
face
.
at
no
time
during
the
whole
ceremony
did
he
catch
her
looking
at
him
again
.
"
why
,
you
stupid
man
,
"
she
said
to
him
later
on
in
the
day
with
a
quick
,
kindly
smile
,
"
i
was
looking
at
you
all
the
time
.
as
soon
as
the
president
or
hanky
began
to
talk
about
you
i
knew
you
would
stare
at
him
,
and
then
i
could
look
.
as
soon
as
they
left
off
talking
about
you
i
knew
you
would
be
looking
at
me
,
unless
you
went
to
sleep
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
as
i
did
not
know
which
you
might
be
doing
,
i
waited
till
they
began
to
talk
about
you
again
.
"
my
father
had
hardly
taken
note
of
his
surroundings
when
the
choir
began
singing
,
accompanied
by
a
few
feeble
flutes
and
lutes
,
or
whatever
the
name
of
the
instrument
should
be
,
but
with
no
violins
,
for
he
knew
nothing
of
the
violin
,
and
had
not
been
able
to
teach
the
erewhonians
anything
about
it
.
the
voices
were
all
in
unison
,
and
the
tune
they
sang
was
one
which
my
father
had
taught
yram
to
sing
;
but
he
could
not
catch
the
words
.
as
soon
as
the
singing
began
,
a
procession
,
headed
by
the
venerable
dr
gurgoyle
,
president
of
the
musical
banks
of
the
province
,
began
to
issue
from
the
robing
-
room
,
and
move
towards
the
middle
of
the
apse
.
the
president
was
sumptuously
dressed
,
but
he
wore
no
mitre
,
nor
anything
to
suggest
an
english
or
european
bishop
.
the
vice
-
president
,
head
manager
,
vice
-
manager
,
and
some
cashiers
of
the
bank
,
now
ranged
themselves
on
either
side
of
him
,
and
formed
an
impressive
group
as
they
stood
,
gorgeously
arrayed
,
at
the
top
of
the
steps
leading
from
the
apse
to
the
nave
.
here
they
waited
till
the
singers
left
off
singing
.
when
the
litany
,
or
hymn
,
or
whatever
it
should
be
called
,
was
over
,
the
head
manager
left
the
president
'
s
side
and
came
down
to
the
lectern
in
the
nave
,
where
he
announced
himself
as
about
to
read
some
passages
from
the
sunchild
'
s
sayings
.
perhaps
because
it
was
the
first
day
of
the
year
according
to
their
new
calendar
,
the
reading
began
with
the
first
chapter
,
the
whole
of
which
was
read
.
my
father
told
me
that
he
quite
well
remembered
having
said
the
last
verse
,
which
he
still
held
as
true
;
hardly
a
word
of
the
rest
was
ever
spoken
by
him
,
though
he
recognised
his
own
influence
in
almost
all
of
it
.
the
reader
paused
,
with
good
effect
,
for
about
five
seconds
between
each
paragraph
,
and
read
slowly
and
very
clearly
.
the
chapter
was
as
follows
:
-
these
are
the
words
of
the
sunchild
about
god
and
man
.
he
said
:
1
.
god
is
the
baseless
basis
of
all
thoughts
,
things
,
and
deeds
.
2
.
so
that
those
who
say
that
there
is
a
god
,
lie
,
unless
they
also
mean
that
there
is
no
god
;
and
those
who
say
that
there
is
no
god
,
lie
,
unless
they
also
mean
that
there
is
a
god
.
3
.
it
is
very
true
to
say
that
man
is
made
after
the
likeness
of
god
;
and
yet
it
is
very
untrue
to
say
this
.
4
.
god
lives
and
moves
in
every
atom
throughout
the
universe
.
therefore
it
is
wrong
to
think
of
him
as
'
him
'
and
'
he
,
'
save
as
by
the
clutching
of
a
drowning
man
at
a
straw
.
5
.
god
is
god
to
us
only
so
long
as
we
cannot
see
him
.
when
we
are
near
to
seeing
him
he
vanishes
,
and
we
behold
nature
in
his
stead
.
6
.
we
approach
him
most
nearly
when
we
think
of
him
as
our
expression
for
man
'
s
highest
conception
,
of
goodness
,
wisdom
,
and
power
.
but
we
cannot
rise
to
him
above
the
level
of
our
own
highest
selves
.
7
.
we
remove
ourselves
most
far
from
him
when
we
invest
him
with
human
form
and
attributes
.
8
.
my
father
the
sun
,
the
earth
,
the
moon
,
and
all
planets
that
roll
round
my
father
,
are
to
god
but
as
a
single
cell
in
our
bodies
to
ourselves
.
9
.
he
is
as
much
above
my
father
,
as
my
father

the

abandoned
for

through
the
pressure
round
it
of

enormous

who
were
assembled

more
singing
followed
of
a
simple
but
impressive
kind
;
during
this
i
am
afraid
i
must
own
that
my
father
,
tired
with
his
walk
,
dropped
off
into
a
refreshing
slumber
,
from
which
he
did
not
wake
till
george
nudged
him
and
told
him
not
to
snore
,
just
as
the

manager
was
going
towards
the
lectern
to
read
another
chapter
of
the
sunchild
'
s
sayings
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
which
was
as
follows
:
-
the
sunchild
also
spoke
to
us
a
parable
about
the
unwisdom
of
the
children
yet
unborn
,
who
though
they
know
so
much
,
yet
do
not
know
as
much
as
they
think
they
do
.
he
said
:
-
"
the
unborn
have
knowledge
of
one
another
so
long
as
they
are
unborn
,
and
this
without
impediment
from
walls
or
material
obstacles
.
the
unborn
children
in
any
city
form
a
population
apart
,
who
talk
with
one
another
and
tell
each
other
about
their
developmental
progress
.
"
they
have
no
knowledge
,
and
cannot
even
conceive
the
existence
of
anything
that
is
not
such
as
they
are
themselves
.
those
who
have
been
born
are
to
them
what
the
dead
are
to
us
.
they
can
see
no
life
in
them
,
and
know
no
more
about
them
than
they
do
of
any
stage
in
their
own
past
development
other
than
the
one
through
which
they
are
passing
at
the
moment
.
they
do
not
even
know
that
their
mothers
are
alive
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
much
less
that
their
mothers
were
once
as
they
now
are
.
to
an
embryo
,
its
mother
is
simply
the
environment
,
and
is
looked
upon
much
as
our
inorganic
surroundings
are
by
ourselves
.
"
the
great
terror
of
their
lives
is
the
fear
of
birth
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
they
shall
have
to
leave
the
only
thing
that
they
can
think
of
as
life
,
and
enter
upon
a
dark
unknown
which
is
to
them
tantamount
to
annihilation
.
"
some
,
indeed
,
among
them
have
maintained
that
birth
is
not
the
death
which
they
commonly
deem
it
,
but
that
there
is
a
life
beyond
the
womb
of
which
they
as
yet
know
nothing
,
and
which
is
a
million
fold
more
truly
life
than
anything
they
have
yet
been
able
even
to
imagine
.
but
the
greater
number
shake
their
yet
unfashioned
heads
and
say
they
have
no
evidence
for
this
that
will
stand

the

again
closed
his

resumed
his

in

professor
hanky
then
went
up
into
the
pulpit
,
richly
but
soberly
robed
in
vestments
the
exact
nature
of
which
i
cannot
determine
.
his
carriage
was
dignified
,
and
the
harsh
lines
on
his
face
gave
it
a
strong
individuality
,
which
,
though
it
did
not
attract
,
conveyed
an
impression
of
power
that
could
not
fail
to
interest
.
as
soon
as
he
had
given
attention
time
to
fix
itself
upon
him
,
he
began
his
sermon
without
text
or
preliminary
matter
of
any
kind
,
and
apparently
without
notes
.
he
spoke
clearly
and
very
quietly
,
especially
at
the
beginning
;
he
used
action
whenever
it
could
point
his
meaning
,
or
give
it
life
and
colour
,
but
there
was
no
approach
to
staginess
or
even
oratorical
display
.
in
fact
,
he
spoke
as
one
who
meant
what
he
was
saying
,
and
desired
that
his
hearers
should
accept
his
meaning
,
fully
confident
in
his
good
faith
.
his
use
of
pause
was
effective
.
after
the
word
"
mistake
,
"
at
the
end
of
the
opening
sentence
,
he
held
up
his
half
-
bent
hand
and
paused
for
full
three
seconds
,
looking
intently
at
his
audience
as
he
did
so
.
every
one
felt
the
idea
to
be
here
enounced
that
was
to
dominate
the
sermon
.
the
sermon

.

.
.
.
.
so
much
of
it
as
i
can
find
room
for

.
.
.
.
was
as
follows
:
-
"
my
friends
,
let
there
be
no
mistake
.
at
such
a
time
,
as
this
,
it
is
well
we
should
look
back
upon
the
path
by
which
we
have
travelled
,
and
forward
to
the
goal
towards
which
we
are
tending
.
as
it
was
necessary
that
the
material
foundations
of
this
building
should
be
so
sure
that
there
shall
be
no
subsidence
in
the
superstructure
,
so
is
it
not
less
necessary
to
ensure
that
there
shall
be
no
subsidence
in
the
immaterial
structure
that
we
have
raised
in
consequence
of
the
sunchild
'
s
sojourn
among
us
.
therefore
,
my
friends
,
i
again
say
,
'
let
there
be
no
mistake

'
each
stone
that
goes
towards
the
uprearing
of
this
visible
fane
,
each
human
soul
that
does
its
part
in
building
the
invisible
temple
of
our
national
faith
,
is
bearing
witness
to
,
and
lending
its
support
to
,
that
which
is
either
the
truth
of
truths
,
or
the
baseless
fabric
of
a
dream
.
"
my
friends
,
this
is
the
only
possible
alternative

he
in
whose
name
we
are
here
assembled

is
either
worthy
of
more
reverential
honour
than
we
can
ever
pay
him
,
or
he
is
worthy
of
no
more
honour
than
any
other
honourable
man
among
ourselves
.
there
can
be
no
halting
between
these
two
opinions

question
of
questions

is
it
to
the
palace
of
the
sun
that
he
returned
when
he
left
us
,
or
was
he
,
as
some
amongst
us
still
do
not
hesitate
to
maintain
,
a
mere
man
,
escaping
by
unusual
but
strictly
natural
means
to
some
part
of

with
which
we
are
unacquainted

my
friends

either
we
are
on
a
right
path

on
a
very
wrong
one
,

in
a
matter
of
such
supreme
importance
.

there
must

miracles
were
performed

fallen

make

spotless

later
weeks

not

a
smile
at

effrontery

continued
:

sign

seal
by
his
presence

bond

his
assent
to
those

changes

have
found

first
great
material
expression
in

see
around

all

expressed
will
of

sunchild
,

and

of

musical
banks
began
as
soon
as
he
had
left
us
to
examine
,
patiently
,
carefully
,
earnestly
,
and
without
bias
of
any
kind
,
firstly
the
evidences
in
support
of
the
sunchild
'
s
claim
to
be
the
son
of
the
tutelar
deity
of

,
and
secondly
the
precise
nature
of
his
instructions
as
regards
the
future
position
and
authority
of
the
musical
banks
.
"
my
friends
,
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
the
sunchild
should
have
given
us
these
instructions
.
with
that
foresight
which
is
the
special
characteristic
of
divine
,
as
compared
with
human
,
wisdom
,
he
desired
that
the
evidences
in
support
of
his
superhuman
character
should
be
collected
,
sifted
,
and
placed
on
record
,
before
anything
was
either
lost
through
the
death
of
those
who
could
alone
substantiate
it
,
or
unduly
supplied
through
the
enthusiasm
of
over
-
zealous
visionaries
.
the
greater
any
true
miracle
has
been
,
the
more
certainly
will
false
ones
accrete
round
it
;
here
,
then
,
we
find
the
explanation
of
the
command
the
sunchild
gave
to
us
to
gather
,
verify
,
and
record
,
the
facts
of
his
sojourn
here
in
erewhon
.
for
above
all
things
he
held
it
necessary
to
ensure
that
there
should
be
neither
mistake
,
nor
even
possibility
of
mistake
.
"
consider
for
a
moment
what
differences
of
opinion
would
infallibly
have
arisen
,
if
the
evidences
for
the
miraculous
character
of
the
sunchild
'
s
mission
had
been
conflicting
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
if
they
had
rested
on
versions
each
claiming
to
be
equally
authoritative
,
but
each
hopelessly
irreconcilable
on
vital
points
with
every
single
other
.
what
would
future
generations
have
said
in
answer
to
those
who
bade
them
fling
all
human
experience
to
the
winds
,
on
the
strength
of
records
written
they
knew
not
certainly
by
whom
,
nor
how
long
after
the
marvels
that
they
recorded
,
and
of
which
all
that
could
be
certainly
said
was
that
no
two
of
them
told
the
same
story
?
"
who
that
believes
either
in
god
or
man

who
with
any
self

respect
,
or
respect
for
the
gift
of
reason
with
which
god
had
endowed
him
,
either
would
,
or
could
,
believe
that
a
chariot
and
four
horses
had
come
down
from
heaven
,
and
gone
back
again
with
human
or
quasi
-
human
occupants
,
unless
the
evidences
for
the
fact
left
no
loophole
for
escape
?
if
a
single
loophole
were
left
him
,
he
would
be
unpardonable
,
not
for
disbelieving
the
story
,
but
for
believing
it
.
the
sin
against
god
would
lie
not
in
want
of
faith
,
but
in
faith
.
"
my
friends
,
there
are
two
sins
in
matters
of
belief
.
there
is
that
of
believing
on
too
little
evidence
,
and
that
of
requiring
too
much
before
we
are
convinced
.
the
guilt
of
the
latter
is
incurred
,
alas
!
by
not
a
few
amongst
us
at
the
present
day
,
but
if
the
testimony
to
the
truth
of
the
wondrous
event
so
faithfully
depicted
on
the
picture
that
confronts
you
had
been
less
contemporaneous
,
less
authoritative
,
less
unanimous
,
future
generations
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
it
is
for
them
that
we
should
now
provide
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
would
be
guilty
of
the
first
-
named
,
and
not
less
heinous
sin
if
they
believed
at
all
.
"
small
wonder
,
then
,
that
the
sunchild
,
having
come
amongst
us
for
our
advantage
,
not
his
own
,
would
not
permit
his
beneficent
designs
to
be
endangered
by

developments

defects

chosen
the
officials
of

downwards

be
the
authoritative

of

it
is
even
possible
that
he
may
be
here
amongst
us
at
this
very
moment
,
disguised
so
that
none
may
know
him
,
and
intent
only
on
watching
our
devotion
towards
him
.
if
this
be
so
,
let
me
implore
him
,
in
the
name
of
the
sun
his
father
,
to
reveal
himself
.
"
now
hanky
had
already
given
my
father
more
than
one
look
that
had
made
him
uneasy
.
he
had
evidently
recognised
him
as
the
supposed
ranger
of
last
thursday
evening
.
twice
he
had
run
his
eye
like
a
searchlight
over
the
front
benches
opposite
to
him
,
and
when
the
beam
had
reached
my
father
there
had
been
no
more
searching
.
it
was
beginning
to
dawn
upon
my
father
that
george
might
have
discovered
that
he
was
not
professor
panky
;
was
it
for
this
reason
that
these
two
young
special
constables
,
though
they
gave
up
their
places
,
still
kept
so
close
to
him
?
was
george
only
waiting
his
opportunity
to
arrest
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
not
of
course
even
suspecting
who
he
was
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
as
a
foreign
devil
who
had
tried
to
pass
himself
off
as
professor
panky
?
had
this
been
the
meaning
of
his
having
followed
him
to
fairmead
?
and
should
he
have
to
be
thrown
into
the
blue
pool
by
george
after
all
?
"
it
would
serve
me
,
"
said
he
to
himself
,
"
richly
right
.
"
these
fears
which
had
been
taking
shape
for
some
few
minutes
were
turned
almost
to
certainties
by
the
half
-
contemptuous
glance
hanky
threw
towards
him
as
he
uttered
what
was
obviously
intended
as
a
challenge
.
he
saw
that
all
was
over
,
and
was
starting
to
his
feet
to
declare
himself
,
and
thus
fall
into
the
trap
that
hanky
was
laying
for
him
,
when
george
gripped
him
tightly
by
the
knee
and
whispered
,
"
don
'
t
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
are
in
great
danger
.
"
and
he
smiled
kindly
as
he
spoke
.
my
father
sank
back
dumbfounded
.
"
you
know
me
?
"
he
whispered
in
reply
.
"
perfectly
.
so
does
hanky
,
so
does
my
mother
;
say
no
more
,
"
and
he
again
smiled
.
george
,
as
my
father
afterwards
learned
,
had
hoped
that
he
would
reveal
himself
,
and
had
determined
in
spite
of
his
mother
'
s
instructions
,
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
.
it
was
for
this
reason
that
he
had
not
arrested
him
quietly
,
as
he
could
very
well
have
done
,
before
the
service
began
.
he
wished
to
discover
what
manner
of
man
his
father
was
,
and
was
quite
happy
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
he
would
have
spoken
out
if
he
had
not
been
checked
.
he
had
not
yet
caught
hanky
'
s
motive
in
trying
to
goad
my
father
,
but
on
seeing
that
he
was
trying
to
do
this
,
he
knew
that
a
trap
was
being
laid
,
and
that
my
father
must
not
be
allowed
to
speak
.
almost
immediately
,
however
,
he
perceived
that
while
his
eyes
had
been
turned
on
hanky
,
two
burly
vergers
had
wormed
their
way
through
the
crowd
and
taken
their
stand
close
to
his
two
brothers
.
then
he
understood
,
and
understood
also
how
to
frustrate
.
as
for
my
father
,
george
'
s
ascendancy
over
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
quite
felt
by
george
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
was
so
absolute
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
now
but
the
exceeding
great
joy
of
finding
his
fears
groundless
,
and
of
delivering
himself
up
to
his
son
'
s
guidance
in
the
assurance
that
the
void
in
his
heart
was
filled
,
and
that
his
wager
not
only
would
be
held
as
won
,
but
was
being
already
paid
.
how
they
had
found
out
,
why
he
was
not
to
speak
as
he
would
assuredly
have
done
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
he
was
in
a
white
heat
of
fury
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
what
did
it
all
matter
now
that
he
had
found
that
which
he
had
feared
he
should
fail
to
find
?
he
gave
george
a
puzzled
smile
,
and
composed
himself
as
best
he
could
to
hear
the
continuation
of
hanky
'
s
sermon
,
which
was
as
follows
:
-
"
who
could
the
sunchild
have
chosen
,
even
though
he
had
been
gifted
with
no
more
than
human
sagacity
,
but
the
body
of
men
whom
he
selected
?
it
becomes
me
but
ill
to
speak
so
warmly
in
favour
of
that
body
of
whom
i
am
the
least
worthy
member
,
but
what
other
is
there
in
erewhon
so
above
all
suspicion
of
slovenliness
,
self
-
seeking
,
preconceived
bias
,
or
bad
faith
?
if
there
was
one
set
of
qualities
more
essential
than
another
for
the
conduct
of
the
investigations
entrusted
to
us
by
the
sunchild
,
it
was
those
that
turn
on
meekness
and
freedom
from
all
spiritual
pride
.
i
believe
i
can
say
quite
truly
that
these
are
the
qualities
for
which
bridgeford
is
more
especially
renowned
.
the
readiness
of
her
professors
to
learn
even
from
those
who
at
first
sight
may
seem
least
able
to
instruct
them
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
gentleness
with
which
they
correct
an
opponent
if
they
feel
it
incumbent
upon
them
to
do
so
,
the
promptitude
with
which
they
acknowledge
error
when
it
is
pointed
out
to
them
and
quit
a
position
no
matter
how
deeply
they
have
been
committed
to
it
,
at
the
first
moment
in
which
they
see
that
they
cannot
hold
it
righteously
,
their
delicate
sense
of
honour
,
their
utter
immunity
from
what
the
sunchild
used
to
call
log
-
rolling
or
intrigue
,
the
scorn
with
which
they
regard
anything
like
hitting
below
the
belt
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
these
i
believe
i
may
truly
say
are
the
virtues
for
which
bridgeford
is
pre
-
eminently
renowned
.
"
the
professor
went
on
to
say
a
great
deal
more
about
the
fitness
of
bridgeford
and
the
musical
bank
managers
for
the
task
imposed
on
them
by
the
sunchild
,
but
here
my
father
'
s
attention
flagged
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
nor
,
on
looking
at
the
verbatim
report
of
the
sermon
that
appeared
next
morning
in
the
leading
sunch
'
ston
journal
,
do
i
see
reason
to
reproduce
hanky
'
s
words
on
this
head
.
it
was
all
to
shew
that
there
had
been
no
possibility
of
mistake
.
meanwhile
george
was
writing
on
a
scrap
of
paper
as
though
he
was
taking
notes
of
the
sermon
.
presently
he
slipped
this
into
my
father
'
s
hand
.
it
ran
:
-
"
you
see
those
vergers
standing
near
my
brothers
,
who
gave
up
their
seats
to
us
.
hanky
tried
to
goad
you
into
speaking
that
they
might
arrest
you
,
and
get
you
into
the
bank
prisons
.
if
you
fall
into
their
hands
you
are
lost
.
i
must
arrest
you
instantly
on
a
charge
of
poaching
