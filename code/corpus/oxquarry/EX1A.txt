the
schoolmaster
was
leaving
the
village
,
and
everybody
seemed
sorry
.
the
miller
at
cresscombe
lent
him
the
small
white
tilted
cart
and
horse
to
carry
his
goods
to
the
city
of
his
destination
,
about
twenty
miles
off
,
such
a
vehicle
proving
of
quite
sufficient
size
for
the
departing
teacher
'
s
effects
.
for
the
schoolhouse
had
been
partly
furnished
by
the
managers
,
and
the
only
cumbersome
article
possessed
by
the
master
,
in
addition
to
the
packing
-
case
of
books
,
was
a
cottage
piano
that
he
had
bought
at
an
auction
during
the
year
in
which
he
thought
of
learning
instrumental
music
.
but
the
enthusiasm
having
waned
he
had
never
acquired
any
skill
in
playing
,
and
the
purchased
article
had
been
a
perpetual
trouble
to
him
ever
since
in
moving
house
.
the
rector
had
gone
away
for
the
day
,
being
a
man
who
disliked
the
sight
of
changes
.
he
did
not
mean
to
return
till
the
evening
,
when
the
new
school
-
teacher
would
have
arrived
and
settled
in
,
and
everything
would
be
smooth
again
.
the
blacksmith
,
the
farm
bailiff
,
and
the
schoolmaster
himself
were
standing
in
perplexed
attitudes
in
the
parlour
before
the
instrument
.
the
master
had
remarked
that
even
if
he
got
it
into
the
cart
he
should
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
on
his
arrival
at
christminster
,
the
city
he
was
bound
for
,
since
he
was
only
going
into
temporary
lodgings
just
at
first
.
a
little
boy
of
eleven
,
who
had
been
thoughtfully
assisting
in
the
packing
,
joined
the
group
of
men
,
and
as
they
rubbed
their
chins
he
spoke
up
,
blushing
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
:
"
aunt
have
got
a
great
fuel
-
house
,
and
it
could
be
put
there
,
perhaps
,
till
you
'
ve
found
a
place
to
settle
in
,
sir
.
"
"
a
proper
good
notion
,
"
said
the
blacksmith
.
it
was
decided
that
a
deputation
should
wait
on
the
boy
'
s
aunt
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
an
old
maiden
resident
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
ask
her
if
she
would
house
the
piano
till
mr
phillotson
should
send
for
it
.
the
smith
and
the
bailiff
started
to
see
about
the
practicability
of
the
suggested
shelter
,
and
the
boy
and
the
schoolmaster
were
left
standing
alone
.
"
sorry
i
am
going
,
jude
?
"
asked
the
latter
kindly
.
tears
rose
into
the
boy
'
s
eyes
,
for
he
was
not
among
the
regular
day
scholars
,
who
came
unromantically
close
to
the
schoolmaster
'
s
life
,
but
one
who
had
attended
the
night
school
only
during
the
present
teacher
'
s
term
of
office
.
the
regular
scholars
,
if
the
truth
must
be
told
,
stood
at
the
present
moment
afar
off
,
like
certain
historic
disciples
,
indisposed
to
any
enthusiastic
volunteering
of
aid
.
the
boy
awkwardly
opened
the
book
he
held
in
his
hand
,
which
mr
phillotson
had
bestowed
on
him
as
a
parting
gift
,
and
admitted
that
he
was
sorry
.
"
so
am
i
,
"
said
mr
phillotson
.
"
why
do
you
go
,
sir
?
"
asked
the
boy
.
"
ah
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
would
be
a
long
story
.
you
would
not
understand
my
reasons
,
jude
.
you
will
,
perhaps
,
when
you
are
older
.
"
"
i
think
i
should
now
,
sir
.
"
"
well
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
do
not
speak
of
this
everywhere
.
you
know
what
a
university
is
,
and
a
university
degree
?
it
is
the
necessary
hallmark
of
a
man
who
wants
to
do
anything
in
teaching
.
my
scheme
,
or
dream
,
is
to
be
a
university
graduate
,
and
then
to
be
ordained
.
by
going
to
live
at
christminster
,
or
near
it
,
i
shall
be
at
headquarters
,
so
to
speak
,
and
if
my
scheme
is
practicable
at
all
,
i
consider
that
being
on
the
spot
will
afford
me
a
better
chance
of
carrying
it
out
than
i
should
have
elsewhere
.
"
the
smith
and
his
companion
returned
.
old
miss
fawley
'
s
fuel
-
house
was
dry
,
and
eminently
practicable
;
and
she
seemed
willing
to
give
the
instrument
standing
-
room
there
.
it
was
accordingly
left
in
the
school
till
the
evening
,
when
more
hands
would
be
available
for
removing
it
;
and
the
schoolmaster
gave
a
final
glance
round
.
the
boy
jude
assisted
in
loading
some
small
articles
,
and
at
nine
o
'
clock
mr
phillotson
mounted
beside
his
box
of
books
and
other
impedimenta
,
and
bade
his
friends
good
-
bye
.
"
i
sha
not
forget
you
,
jude
,
"
he
said
,
smiling
,
as
the
cart
moved
off
.
"
be
a
good
boy
,
remember
;
and
be
kind
to
animals
and
birds
,
and
read
all
you
can
.
and
if
ever
you
come
to
christminster
remember
you
hunt
me
out
for
old
acquaintance
'
sake
.
"
the
cart
creaked
across
the
green
,
and
disappeared
round
the
corner
by
the
rectory
-
house
.
the
boy
returned
to
the
draw
-
well
at
the
edge
of
the
greensward
,
where
he
had
left
his
buckets
when
he
went
to
help
his
patron
and
teacher
in
the
loading
.
there
was
a
quiver
in
his
lip
now
and
after
opening
the
well
-
cover
to
begin
lowering
the
bucket
he
paused
and
leant
with
his
forehead
and
arms
against
the
framework
,
his
face
wearing
the
fixity
of
a
thoughtful
child
'
s
who
has
felt
the
pricks
of
life
somewhat
before
his
time
.
the
well
into
which
he
was
looking
was
as
ancient
as
the
village
itself
,
and
from
his
present
position
appeared
as
a
long
circular
perspective
ending
in
a
shining
disk
of
quivering
water
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
feet
down
.
there
was
a
lining
of
green
moss
near
the
top
,
and
nearer
still
the
hart
'
s
-
tongue
fern
.
he
said
to
himself
,
in
the
melodramatic
tones
of
a
whimsical
boy
,
that
the
schoolmaster
had
drawn
at
that
well
scores
of
times
on
a
morning
like
this
,
and
would
never
draw
there
any
more
.
"
i
'
ve
seen
him
look
down
into
it
,
when
he
was
tired
with
his
drawing
,
just
as
i
do
now
,
and
when
he
rested
a
bit
before
carrying
the
buckets
home
!
but
he
was
too
clever
to
bide
here
any
longer
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
small
sleepy
place
like
this
!
"
a
tear
rolled
from
his
eye
into
the
depths
of
the
well
.
the
morning
was
a
little
foggy
,
and
the
boy
'
s
breathing
unfurled
itself
as
a
thicker
fog
upon
the
still
and
heavy
air
.
his
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
a
sudden
outcry
:
"
bring
on
that
water
,
will
ye
,
you
idle
young
harlican
!
"
it
came
from
an
old
woman
who
had
emerged
from
her
door
towards
the
garden
gate
of
a
green
-
thatched
cottage
not
far
off
.
the
boy
quickly
waved
a
signal
of
assent
,
drew
the
water
with
what
was
a
great
effort
for
one
of
his
stature
,
landed
and
emptied
the
big
bucket
into
his
own
pair
of
smaller
ones
,
and
pausing
a
moment
for
breath
,
started
with
them
across
the
patch
of
clammy
greensward
whereon
the
well
stood
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
nearly
in
the
centre
of
the
little
village
,
or
rather
hamlet
of
marygreen
.
it
was
as
old
-
fashioned
as
it
was
small
,
and
it
rested
in
the
lap
of
an
undulating
upland
adjoining
the
north
wessex
downs
.
old
as
it
was
,
however
,
the
well
-
shaft
was
probably
the
only
relic
of
the
local
history
that
remained
absolutely
unchanged
.
many
of
the
thatched
and
dormered
dwelling
-
houses
had
been
pulled
down
of
late
years
,
and
many
trees
felled
on
the
green
.
above
all
,
the
original
church
,
hump
-
backed
,
wood
-
turreted
,
and
quaintly
hipped
,
had
been
taken
down
,
and
either
cracked
up
into
heaps
of
road
-
metal
in
the
lane
,
or
utilized
as
pig
-
sty
walls
,
garden
seats
,
guard
-
stones
to
fences
,
and
rockeries
in
the
flower
-
beds
of
the
neighbourhood
.
in
place
of
it
a
tall
new
building
of
modern
gothic
design
,
unfamiliar
to
english
eyes
,
had
been
erected
on
a
new
piece
of
ground
by
a
certain
obliterator
of
historic
records
who
had
run
down
from
london
and
back
in
a
day
.
the
site
whereon
so
long
had
stood
the
ancient
temple
to
the
christian
divinities
was
not
even
recorded
on
the
green
and
level
grass
-
plot
that
had
immemorially
been
the
churchyard
,
the
obliterated
graves
being
commemorated
by
eighteen
-
penny
castiron
crosses
warranted
to
last
five
years
.
slender
as
was
jude
fawley
'
s
frame
he
bore
the
two
brimming
house
-
buckets
of
water
to
the
cottage
without
resting
.
over
the
door
was
a
little
rectangular
piece
of
blue
board
,
on
which
was
painted
in
yellow
letters
,
"
drusilla
fawley
,
baker
.
"
within
the
little
lead
panes
of
the
window
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
this
being
one
of
the
few
old
houses
left
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
were
five
bottles
of
sweets
,
and
three
buns
on
a
plate
of
the
willow
pattern
.
while
emptying
the
buckets
at
the
back
of
the
house
he
could
hear
an
animated
conversation
in
progress
within
-
doors
between
his
great
-
aunt
,
the
drusilla
of
the
sign
-
board
,
and
some
other
villagers
.
having
seen
the
school
-
master
depart
,
they
were
summing
up
particulars
of
the
event
,
and
indulging
in
predictions
of
his
future
.
"
and
who
'
s
he
?
"
asked
one
,
comparatively
a
stranger
,
when
the
boy
entered
.
"
well

med

,
mrs
williams
.
he
is
my
great

nephew

.
.

.

since
you
was
last
this
way
.
"
the
old
inhabitant
who
answered
was
a
tall
,
gaunt
woman
,
who
spoke
tragically
on
the
most
trivial
subject
,
and
gave
a
phrase
of
her
conversation
to
each
auditor
in
turn
.
"

from
mellstock

down
in
south

about
a

"
she
continued
,
as
the
boy
,
feeling
the
impact
of
their
glances
like
slaps
upon
his
face
,
moved
aside
.
the
local
washerwoman
replied
that
it
was
perhaps
a
very
good
plan
of
miss
or
mrs
fawley

s
(
as
they
called
her
indifferently
)

"
she
continued
,
in
frowning
pleasantry
.
"
i
am
sure
he
could
not

took

"
jude
,
finding
the
general
attention
again
centering
on
himself
,
went
out
to
the
bakehouse
,
where
he
ate
the
cake
provided
for
his
breakfast
.
the
end
of
his
spare
time
had
now
arrived
,
and
emerging
from
the
garden
by
getting
over
the
hedge
at
the
back
he
pursued
a
path
northward
,
till
he
came
to
a
wide
and
lonely
depression
in
the
general
level
of
the
upland
,
which
was
sown
as
a
corn
-
field
.
this
vast
concave
was
the
scene
of
his
labours
for
mr
troutham
the
farmer
,
and
he
descended
into
the
midst
of
it
.
the
brown
surface
of
the
field
went
right
up
towards
the
sky
all
round
,
where
it
was
lost
by
degrees
in
the
mist
that
shut
out
the
actual
verge
and
accentuated
the
solitude
.
the
only
marks
on
the
uniformity
of
the
scene
were
a
rick
of
last
year
'
s
produce
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
arable
,
the
rooks
that
rose
at
his
approach
,
and
the
path
athwart
the
fallow
by
which
he
had
come
,
trodden
now
by
he
hardly
knew
whom
,
though
once
by
many
of
his
own
dead
family
.
"
how
ugly
it
is
here
!
"
he
murmured
.
the
fresh
harrow
-
lines
seemed
to
stretch
like
the
channellings
in
a
piece
of
new
corduroy
,
lending
a
meanly
utilitarian
air
to
the
expanse
,
taking
away
its
gradations
,
and
depriving
it
of
all
history
beyond
that
of
the
few
recent
months
,
though
to
every
clod
and
stone
there
really
attached
associations
enough
and
to
spare

.
.
.

echoes
of
songs
from
ancient
harvest
-
days
,
of
spoken
words
,
and
of
sturdy
deeds

every
inch
of
ground
had
been
the
site

of
energy
,
gaiety
,
horse

play
,

divided
the
field

themselves
to

heads
to
look
at
them
by
the
next
harvest
;
and
in
that
ancient
cornfield
many
a
man
had
made
love
-
promises
to
a
woman
at
whose
voice
he
had
trembled
by
the
next
seed
-
time
after
fulfilling
them
in
the
church
adjoining
.
but
this
neither
jude
nor
the
rooks
around
him
considered
.
for
them
it
was
a
lonely
place
,
possessing
,
in
the
one
view
,
only
the
quality
of
a
work
-
ground
,
and
in
the
other
that
of
a
granary
good
to
feed
in
.
the
boy
stood
under
the
rick
before
mentioned
,
and
every
few
seconds
used
his
clacker
or
rattle
briskly
.
at
each
clack
the
rooks
left
off
pecking
,
and
rose
and
went
away
on
their
leisurely
wings
,
burnished
like
tassets
of
mail
,
afterwards
wheeling
back
and
regarding
him
warily
,
and
descending
to
feed
at
a
more
respectful
distance
.
he
sounded
the
clacker
till
his
arm
ached
,
and
at
length
his
heart
grew
sympathetic
with
the
birds
'
thwarted
desires
.
they
seemed
,
like
himself
,
to
be
living
in
a
world
which
did
not
want
them
.
why
should
he
frighten
them
away
?
they
took
upon
more
and
more
the
aspect
of
gentle
friends
and
pensioners
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
only
friends
he
could
claim
as
being
in
the
least
degree
interested
in
him
,
for
his
aunt
had
often
told
him
that
she
was
not
.
he
ceased
his
rattling
,
and
they
alighted
anew
.
"
poor
little
dears
!
"
said
jude
,
aloud
.
"
you
shall
have
some
dinner
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
shall
.
there
is
enough
for
us
all
.
farmer
troutham
can
afford
to
let
you
have
some
.
eat
,
then
my
dear
little
birdies
,
and
make
a
good
meal
!
"
they
stayed
and
ate
,
inky
spots
on
the
nut
-
brown
soil
and
jude
enjoyed
their
appetite
.
a
magic
thread
of
fellow
-
feeling
united
his
own
life
with
theirs
.
puny
and
sorry
as
those
lives
were
,
they
much
resembled
his
own
.
his
clacker
he
had
by
this
time
thrown
away
from
him
,
as
being
a
mean
and
sordid
instrument
,
offensive
both
to
the
birds
and
to
himself
as
their
friend
.
all
at
once
he
became
conscious
of
a
smart
blow
upon
his
buttocks
,
followed
by
a
loud
clack
,
which
announced
to
his
surprised
senses
that
the
clacker
had
been
the
instrument
of
offence
used
.
the
birds
and
jude
started
up
simultaneously
,
and
the
dazed
eyes
of
the
latter
beheld
the
farmer
in
person
,
the
great
troutham
himself
,
his
red
face
glaring
down
upon
jude
'
s
cowering
frame
,
the
clacker
swinging
in
his
hand
.
"
so
it
is
'
eat
my
dear
birdies
,
'
is
it
,
young
man
?
'
eat
,
dear
birdies
,
'
indeed
!
i
will
tickle
your
breeches
,
and
see
if
you
say
,
'
eat
,
dear
birdies
,
'
again
in
a
hurry
!
and
you
'
ve
been
idling
at
the
schoolmaster
'
s
too
,
instead
of
coming
here
,
ha
'
n
'
t
ye
,
hey
?
that
'
s
how
you
earn
your
sixpence
a
day
for
keeping
the
rooks
off
my
corn
!
"
whilst
saluting
jude
'
s
ears
with
this
impassioned
rhetoric
,
troutham
had
seized
his
left
hand
with
his
own
left
,
and
swinging
his
slim
frame
round
him
at
arm
'
s
-
length
,
again
struck
jude
on
the
hind
parts
with
the
flat
side
of
jude
'
s
own
rattle
,
till
the
field
echoed
with
the
blows
,
which
were
delivered
once
or
twice
at
each
revolution
.
"
do
not
'
ee
,
sir
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
please
do
not
'
ee
!
"
cried
the
whirling
child
,
as
helpless
under
the
centrifugal
tendency
of
his
person
as
a
hooked
fish
swinging
to
land
,
and
beholding
the
hill
,
the
rick
,
the
plantation
,
the
path
,
and
the
rooks
going
round
and
round
him
in
an
amazing
circular
race
.
"
i
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
sir
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
only
meant
that
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
there
was
a
good
crop
in
the
ground
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
saw
'
em
sow
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
the
rooks
could
have
a
little
bit
for
dinner
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
you
would
not
miss
it
,
sir
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
mr
phillotson
said
i
was
to
be
kind
to
'
em
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
"
this
truthful
explanation
seemed
to
exasperate
the
farmer
even
more
than
if
jude
had
stoutly
denied
saying
anything
at
all
,
and
he
still
smacked
the
whirling
urchin
,
the
clacks
of
the
instrument
continuing
to
resound
all
across
the
field
and
as
far
as
the
ears
of
distant
workers
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
who
gathered
thereupon
that
jude
was
pursuing
his
business
of
clacking
with
great
assiduity
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
echoing
from
the
brand
-
new
church
tower
just
behind
the
mist
,
towards
the
building
of
which
structure
the
farmer
had
largely
subscribed
,
to
testify
his
love
for
god
and
man
.
presently
troutham
grew
tired
of
his
punitive
task
,
and
depositing
the
quivering
boy
on
his
legs
,
took
a
sixpence
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
him
in
payment
for
his
day
'
s
work
,
telling
him
to
go
home
and
never
let
him
see
him
in
one
of
those
fields
again
.
jude
leaped
out
of
arm
'
s
reach
,
and
walked
along
the
trackway
weeping
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
not
from
the
pain
,
though
that
was
keen
enough
;
not
from
the
perception
of
the
flaw
in
the
terrestrial
scheme
,
by
which
what
was
good
for
god
'
s
birds
was
bad
for
god
'
s
gardener
;
but
with
the
awful
sense
that
he
had
wholly
disgraced
himself
before
he
had
been
a
year
in
the
parish
,
and
hence
might
be
a
burden
to
his
great
-
aunt
for
life
.
with
this
shadow
on
his
mind
he
did
not
care
to
show
himself
in
the
village
,
and
went
homeward
by
a
roundabout
track
behind
a
high
hedge
and
across
a
pasture
.
here
he
beheld
scores
of
coupled
earthworms
lying
half
their
length
on
the
surface
of
the
damp
ground
,
as
they
always
did
in
such
weather
at
that
time
of
the
year
.
it
was
impossible
to
advance
in
regular
steps
without
crushing
some
of
them
at
each
tread
.
though
farmer
troutham
had
just
hurt
him
,
he
was
a
boy
who
could
not
himself
bear
to
hurt
anything
.
he
had
never
brought
home
a
nest
of
young
birds
without
lying
awake
in
misery
half
the
night
after
,
and
often
re
-
instating
them
and
the
nest
in
their
original
place
the
next
morning
.
he
could
scarcely
bear
to
see
trees
cut
down
or
lopped
,
from
a
fancy
that
it
hurt
them
;
and
late
pruning
,
when
the
sap
was
up
and
the
tree
bled
profusely
,
had
been
a
positive
grief
to
him
in
his
infancy
.
this
weakness
of
character
,
as
it
may
be
called
,
suggested
that
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
was
born
to
ache
a
good
deal
before
the
fall
of
the
curtain
upon
his
unnecessary
life
should
signify
that
all
was
well
with
him
again
.
he
carefully
picked
his
way
on
tiptoe
among
the
earthworms
,
without
killing
a
single
one
.
on
entering
the
cottage
he
found
his
aunt
selling
a
penny
loaf
to
a
little
girl
,
and
when
the
customer
was
gone
she
said
,
"
well
,
how
do
you
come
to
be
back
here
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
like
this
?
"
"
i
am
turned
away
.
"
"
what
?
"
"
mr
.
troutham
have
turned
me
away
because
i

the
rooks
have

few
peckings
of

and
there
'
s
my
wages
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
last
i
shall
ever
hae

"
he
threw
the
sixpence
tragically
on
the
table
.
"
ah
!
"
said
his
aunt
,
suspending
her
breath
.
and
she
opened
upon
him
a
lecture
on
how
she
would
now
have
him
all
the
spring
upon
her
hands
doing
nothing
.
"
if
you
ca
not
skeer
birds
,
what
can
ye
do
?
there
!
do
not
ye
look
so
deedy

"
more
angry
with
jude
for
demeaning
her
by
coming
there
than
for
dereliction
of
duty
,
she
rated
him
primarily
from
that
point
of
view
,
and
only
secondarily
from
a
moral
one
.

asked
the
boy
,
after
meditating
in
silence
.
"

!
you

"

you
would
not
ask
such
as
that

never
had
anything

"
jude
went
out
,
and
,
feeling
more
than
ever
his
existence
to
be
an
undemanded
one
,
he
lay
down
upon
his
back
on
a
heap
of
litter
near
the
pig
-
sty
.
the
fog
had
by
this
time
become
more
translucent
,
and
the
position
of
the
sun
could
be
seen
through
it
.
he
pulled
his
straw
hat
over
his
face
,
and
peered
through
the
interstices
of
the
plaiting
at
the
white
brightness
,
vaguely
reflecting
.
growing
up
brought
responsibilities
,
he
found
.
events
did
not
rhyme
quite
as
he
had
thought
.
nature
'
s
logic
was
too
horrid
for
him
to
care
for
.
that
mercy
towards
one
set
of
creatures
was
cruelty
towards
another
sickened
his
sense
of
harmony
.
as
you
got
older
,
and
felt
yourself
to
be
at
the
centre
of
your
time
,
and
not
at
a
point
in
its
circumference
,
as
you
had
felt
when
you
were
little
,
you
were
seized
with
a
sort
of
shuddering
,
he
perceived
.
all
around
you
there
seemed
to
be
something
glaring
,
garish
,
rattling
,
and
the
noises
and
glares
hit
upon
the
little
cell
called
your
life
,
and
shook
it
,
and
warped
it
.
if
he
could
only
prevent
himself
growing
up
!
he
did
not
want
to
be
a
man
.
then
,
like
the
natural
boy
,
he
forgot
his
despondency
,
and
sprang
up
.
during
the
remainder
of
the
morning
he
helped
his
aunt
,
and
in
the
afternoon
,
when
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
,
he
went
into
the
village
.
here
he
asked
a
man
whereabouts
christminster
lay
.
"
christminster
?
oh
,
well
,
out
by
there
yonder
;
though
i
'
ve
never
bin
there
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
not
i
.
i
'
ve
never
had
any
business
at
such
a
place
.
"
the
man
pointed
north
-
eastward
,
in
the
very
direction
where
lay
that
field
in
which
jude
had
so
disgraced
himself
.
there
was
something
unpleasant
about
the
coincidence
for
the
moment
,
but
the
fearsomeness
of
this
fact
rather
increased
his
curiosity
about
the
city
.
the
farmer
had
said
he
was
never
to
be
seen
in
that
field
again
;
yet
christminster
lay
across
it
,
and
the
path
was
a
public
one
.
so
,
stealing
out
of
the
hamlet
,
he
descended
into
the
same
hollow
which
had
witnessed
his
punishment
in
the
morning
,
never
swerving
an
inch
from
the
path
,
and
climbing
up
the
long
and
tedious
ascent
on
the
other
side
till
the
track
joined
the
highway
by
a
little
clump
of
trees
.
here
the
ploughed
land
ended
,
and
all
before
him
was
bleak
open
down
.
not
a
soul
was
visible
on
the
hedgeless
highway
,
or
on
either
side
of
it
,
and
the
white
road
seemed
to
ascend
and
diminish
till
it
joined
the
sky
.
at
the
very
top
it
was
crossed
at
right
angles
by
a
green
"
ridgeway
"
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
ickneild
street
and
original
roman
road
through
the
district
.
this
ancient
track
ran
east
and
west
for
many
miles
,
and
down
almost
to
within
living
memory
had
been
used
for
driving
flocks
and
herds
to
fairs
and
markets
.
but
it
was
now
neglected
and
overgrown
.
the
boy
had
never
before
strayed
so
far
north
as
this
from
the
nestling
hamlet
in
which
he
had
been
deposited
by
the
carrier
from
a
railway
station
southward
,
one
dark
evening
some
few
months
earlier
,
and
till
now
he
had
had
no
suspicion
that
such
a
wide
,
flat
,
low
-
lying
country
lay
so
near
at
hand
,
under
the
very
verge
of
his
upland
world
.
the
whole
northern
semicircle
between
east
and
west
,
to
a
distance
of
forty
or
fifty
miles
,
spread
itself
before
him
;
a
bluer
,
moister
atmosphere
,
evidently
,
than
that
he
breathed
up
here
.
not
far
from
the
road
stood
a
weather
-
beaten
old
barn
of
reddish
-
grey
brick
and
tile
.
it
was
known
as
the
brown
house
by
the
people
of
the
locality
.
he
was
about
to
pass
it
when
he
perceived
a
ladder
against
the
eaves
;
and
the
reflection
that
the
higher
he
got
,
the
further
he
could
see
,
led
jude
to
stand
and
regard
it
.
on
the
slope
of
the
roof
two
men
were
repairing
the
tiling
.
he
turned
into
the
ridgeway
and
drew
towards
the
barn
.
when
he
had
wistfully
watched
the
workmen
for
some
time
he
took
courage
,
and
ascended
the
ladder
till
he
stood
beside
them
.
"
well
,
my
lad
,
and
what
may
you
want
up
here
?
"
"
i
wanted
to
know
where
the
city
of
christminster
is
,
if
you
please
.
"
"
christminster
is
out
across
there
,
by
that
clump
.
you
can
see
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
at
least
you
can
on
a
clear
day
.
ah
,
no
,
you
ca
not
now
.
"
the
other
tiler
,
glad
of
any
kind
of
diversion
from
the
monotony
of
his
labour
,
had
also
turned
to
look
towards
the
quarter
designated
.
"
you
ca
not
often
see
it
in
weather
like
this
,
"
he
said
.
"
the
time
i
'
ve
noticed
it
is
when
the
sun
is
going
down
in
a
blaze
of
flame
,
and
it
looks
like
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
do
not
know
what
.
"
"
the
heavenly
jerusalem
,
"
suggested
the
serious
urchin
.
"
ay
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
though
i
should
never
ha
'
thought
of
it
myself
.
.
.
.
but
i
ca
not
see
no
christminster
to
-
day
.
"
the
boy
strained
his
eyes
also
;
yet
neither
could
he
see
the
far
-
off
city
.
he
descended
from
the
barn
,
and
abandoning
christminster
with
the
versatility
of
his
age
he
walked
along
the
ridge
-
track
,
looking
for
any
natural
objects
of
interest
that
might
lie
in
the
banks
thereabout
.
when
he
repassed
the
barn
to
go
back
to
marygreen
he
observed
that
the
ladder
was
still
in
its
place
,
but
that
the
men
had
finished
their
day
'
s
work
and
gone
away
.
it
was
waning
towards
evening
;
there
was
still
a
faint
mist
,
but
it
had
cleared
a
little
except
in
the
damper
tracts
of
subjacent
country
and
along
the
river
-
courses
.
he
thought
again
of
christminster
,
and
wished
,
since
he
had
come
two
or
three
miles
from
his
aunt
'
s
house
on
purpose
,
that
he
could
have
seen
for
once
this
attractive
city
of
which
he
had
been
told
.
but
even
if
he
waited
here
it
was
hardly
likely
that
the
air
would
clear
before
night
.
yet
he
was
loth
to
leave
the
spot
,
for
the
northern
expanse
became
lost
to
view
on
retreating
towards
the
village
only
a
few
hundred
yards
.
he
ascended
the
ladder
to
have
one
more
look
at
the
point
the
men
had
designated
,
and
perched
himself
on
the
highest
rung
,
overlying
the
tiles
.
he
might
not
be
able
to
come
so
far
as
this
for
many
days
.
perhaps
if
he
prayed
,
the
wish
to
see
christminster
might
be
forwarded
.
people
said
that
,
if
you
prayed
,
things
sometimes
came
to
you
,
even
though
they
sometimes
did
not
.
he
had
read
in
a
tract
that
a
man
who
had
begun
to
build
a
church
,
and
had
no
money
to
finish
it
,
knelt
down
and
prayed
,
and
the
money
came
in
by
the
next
post
.
another
man
tried
the
same
experiment
,
and
the
money
did
not
come
;
but
he
found
afterwards
that
the
breeches
he
knelt
in
were
made
by
a
wicked
jew
.
this
was
not
discouraging
,
and
turning
on
the
ladder
jude
knelt
on
the
third
rung
,
where
,
resting
against
those
above
it
,
he
prayed
that
the
mist
might
rise
.
he
then
seated
himself
again
,
and
waited
.
in
the
course
of
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
the
thinning
mist
dissolved
altogether
from
the
northern
horizon
,
as
it
had
already
done
elsewhere
,
and
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
time
of
sunset
the
westward
clouds
parted
,
the
sun
'
s
position
being
partially
uncovered
,
and
the
beams
streaming
out
in
visible
lines
between
two
bars
of
slaty
cloud
.
the
boy
immediately
looked
back
in
the
old
direction
.
some
way
within
the
limits
of
the
stretch
of
landscape
,
points
of
light
like
the
topaz
gleamed
.
the
air
increased
in
transparency
with
the
lapse
of
minutes
,
till
the
topaz
points
showed
themselves
to
be
the
vanes
,
windows
,
wet
roof
slates
,
and
other
shining
spots
upon
the
spires
,
domes
,
freestone
-
work
,
and
varied
outlines
that
were
faintly
revealed
.
it
was
christminster
,
unquestionably
;
either
directly
seen
,
or
miraged
in
the
peculiar
atmosphere
.
the
spectator
gazed
on
and
on
till
the
windows
and
vanes
lost
their
shine
,
going
out
almost
suddenly
like
extinguished
candles
.
the
vague
city
became
veiled
in
mist
.
turning
to
the
west
,
he
saw
that
the
sun
had
disappeared
.
the
foreground
of
the
scene
had
grown
funereally
dark
,
and
near
objects
put
on
the
hues
and
shapes
of
chimaeras
.
he
anxiously
descended
the
ladder
,
and
started
homewards
at
a
run
,
trying
not
to
think
of
giants
,
herne
the
hunter
,
apollyon
lying
in
wait
for
christian
,
or
of
the
captain
with
the
bleeding
hole
in
his
forehead
and
the
corpses
round
him
that
remutinied
every
night
on
board
the
bewitched
ship
.
he
knew
that
he
had
grown
out
of
belief
in
these
horrors
,
yet
he
was
glad
when
he
saw
the
church
tower
and
the
lights
in
the
cottage
windows
,
even
though
this
was
not
the
home
of
his
birth
,
and
his
great
-
aunt
did
not
care
much
about
him
.
inside
and
round
about
that
old
woman
'
s
"
shop
"
window
,
with
its
twenty
-
four
little
panes
set
in
lead
-
work
,
the
glass
of
some
of
them
oxidized
with
age
,
so
that
you
could
hardly
see
the
poor
penny
articles
exhibited
within
,
and
forming
part
of
a
stock
which
a
strong
man
could
have
carried
,
jude
had
his
outer
being
for
some
long
tideless
time
.
but
his
dreams
were
as
gigantic
as
his
surroundings
were
small
.
through
the
solid
barrier
of
cold
cretaceous
upland
to
the
northward
he
was
always
beholding
a
gorgeous
city
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
fancied
place
he
had
likened
to
the
new
jerusalem
,
though
there
was
perhaps
more
of
the
painter
'
s
imagination
and
less
of
the
diamond
merchant
'
s
in
his
dreams
thereof
than
in
those
of
the
apocalyptic
writer
.
and
the
city
acquired
a
tangibility
,
a
permanence
,
a
hold
on
his
life
,
mainly
from
the
one
nucleus
of
fact
that
the
man
for
whose
knowledge
and
purposes
he
had
so
much
reverence
was
actually
living
there
;
not
only
so
,
but
living
among
the
more
thoughtful
and
mentally
shining
ones
therein
.
in
sad
wet
seasons
,
though
he
knew
it
must
rain
at
christminster
too
,
he
could
hardly
believe
that
it
rained
so
drearily
there
.
whenever
he
could
get
away
from
the
confines
of
the
hamlet
for
an
hour
or
two
,
which
was
not
often
,
he
would
steal
off
to
the
brown
house
on
the
hill
and
strain
his
eyes
persistently
;
sometimes
to
be
rewarded
by
the
sight
of
a
dome
or
spire
,
at
other
times
by
a
little
smoke
,
which
in
his
estimate
had
some
of
the
mysticism
of
incense
.
then
the
day
came
when
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
ascended
to
the
point
of
view
after
dark
,
or
possibly
went
a
mile
or
two
further
,
he
would
see
the
night
lights
of
the
city
.
it
would
be
necessary
to
come
back
alone
,
but
even
that
consideration
did
not
deter
him
,
for
he
could
throw
a
little
manliness
into
his
mood
,
no
doubt
.
the
project
was
duly
executed
.
it
was
not
late
when
he
arrived
at
the
place
of
outlook
,
only
just
after
dusk
,
but
a
black
north
-
east
sky
,
accompanied
by
a
wind
from
the
same
quarter
,
made
the
occasion
dark
enough
.
he
was
rewarded
;
but
what
he
saw
was
not
the
lamps
in
rows
,
as
he
had
half
expected
.
no
individual
light
was
visible
,
only
a
halo
or
glow
-
fog
over
-
arching
the
place
against
the
black
heavens
behind
it
,
making
the
light
and
the
city
seem
distant
but
a
mile
or
so
.
he
set
himself
to
wonder
on
the
exact
point
in
the
glow
where
the
schoolmaster
might
be
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
who
never
communicated
with
anybody
at
marygreen
now
;
who
was
as
if
dead
to
them
here
.
in
the
glow
he
seemed
to
see
phillotson
promenading
at
ease
,
like
one
of
the
forms
in
nebuchadnezzar
'
s
furnace
.
he
had
heard
that
breezes
travelled
at
the
rate
of
ten
miles
an
hour
,
and
the
fact
now
came
into
his
mind
.
he
parted
his
lips
as
he
faced
the
north
-
east
,
and
drew
in
the
wind
as
if
it
were
a
sweet
liquor
.
"
you
,
"
he
said
,
addressing
the
breeze
caressingly
"
were
in
christminster
city
between
one
and
two
hours
ago
,
floating
along
the
streets
,
pulling
round
the
weather
-
cocks
,
touching
mr
phillotson
'
s
face
,
being
breathed
by
him
;
and
now
you
are
here
,
breathed
by
me
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
,
the
very
same
.
"
suddenly
there
came
along
this
wind
something
towards
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
message
from
the
place
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
from
some
soul
residing
there
,
it
seemed
.
surely
it
was
the
sound
of
bells
,
the
voice
of
the
city
,
faint
and
musical
,
calling
to
him
,
"
we
are
happy
here
!
"
he
had
become
entirely
lost
to
his
bodily
situation
during
this
mental
leap
,
and
only
got
back
to
it
by
a
rough
recalling
.
a
few
yards
below
the
brow
of
the
hill
on
which
he
paused
a
team
of
horses
made
its
appearance
,
having
reached
the
place
by
dint
of
half
an
hour
'
s
serpentine
progress
from
the
bottom
of
the
immense
declivity
.
they
had
a
load
of
coals
behind
them
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
fuel
that
could
only
be
got
into
the
upland
by
this
particular
route
.
they
were
accompanied
by
a
carter
,
a
second
man
,
and
a
boy
,
who
now
kicked
a
large
stone
behind
one
of
the
wheels
,
and
allowed
the
panting
animals
to
have
a
long
rest
,
while
those
in
charge
took
a
flagon
off
the
load
and
indulged
in
a
drink
round
.
they
were
elderly
men
,
and
had
genial
voices
.
jude
addressed
them
,
inquiring
if
they
had
come
from
christminster
.
"
heaven
forbid
,
with
this
load
!
"
said
they
.
"
the
place
i
mean
is
that
one
yonder
.
"
he
was
getting
so
romantically
attached
to
christminster
that
,
like
a
young
lover
alluding
to
his
mistress
,
he
felt
bashful
at
mentioning
its
name
again
.
he
pointed
to
the
light
in
the
sky
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
hardly
perceptible
to
their
older
eyes
.
"
yes
.
there
do
seem
a
spot
a
bit
brighter
in
the
nor
'
-
east
than
elsewhere
,
though
i
should
not
ha
'
noticed
it
myself
,
and
no
doubt
it
med
be
christminster
.
"
here
a
little
book
of
tales
which
jude
had
tucked
up
under
his
arm
,
having
brought
them
to
read
on
his
way
hither
before
it
grew
dark
,
slipped
and
fell
into
the
road
.
the
carter
eyed
him
while
he
picked
it
up
and
straightened
the
leaves
.
"
ah
,
young
man
,
"
he
observed
,
"
you
'
d
have
to
get
your
head
screwed
on

'
other
way
before
you
could
read
what

"
"
why
?
"
asked
the
boy
.
"
oh
,
they
never
look
at
anything
that
folks
like
we
can
understand

"
the
carter
continued
,
by
way
of
passing
the
time
.
"
on

foreign
tongues

in

days

jude
,
throwing
a
last
adoring
look
at
the
distant
halo
,
turned
and
walked
beside
his
remarkably
well
-
informed
friend
,
who
had
no
objection
to
telling
him
as
they
moved
on
more
yet
of

city

its
towers

halls

the

turned
into

cross

road

jude
thanked
the
carter
warmly
for
his
information

and
said
he
only
wished
he
could
talk
half
as
well
about
christminster

"
jude
continued
his
walk
homeward
alone
,
pondering
so
deeply
that
he
forgot
to
feel
timid
.
he
suddenly
grew
older
.
it
had
been
the
yearning
of
his
heart
to
find
something
to
anchor
on
,
to
cling
to
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
some
place
which
he
could
call
admirable
.
should
he
find
that
place
in
this
city
if
he
could
get
there
?
would
it
be
a
spot
in
which
,
without
fear
of
farmers
,
or
hindrance
,
or
ridicule
,
he
could
watch
and
wait
,
and
set
himself
to
some
mighty
undertaking
like
the
men
of
old
of
whom
he
had
heard
?
as
the
halo
had
been
to
his
eyes
when
gazing
at
it
a
quarter
of
an
hour
earlier
,
so
was
the
spot
mentally
to
him
as
he
pursued
his
dark
way
.
"
it
is
a
city
of
light
,
"
he
said
to
himself
.
"
the
tree
of
knowledge
grows
there
,
"
he
added
a
few
steps
further
on
.
"
it
is
a
place
that
teachers
of
men
spring
from
and
go
to
.
"
"
it
is
what
you
may
call
a
castle
,
manned
by
scholarship
and
religion
.
"
after
this
figure
he
was
silent
a
long
while
,
till
he
added
:
"
it
would
just
suit
me
.
"
walking
somewhat
slowly
by
reason
of
his
concentration
,
the
boy
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
an
ancient
man
in
some
phases
of
thought
,
much
younger
than
his
years

.
.
.
.
.
.
was
overtaken
by
a
light
-
footed
pedestrian
,
whom
,
notwithstanding
the
gloom
,
he
could
perceive
to
be
wearing
an
extraordinarily
tall
hat
,
a
swallow
-
tailed
coat
,
and
a
watch
-
chain
that
danced
madly
and
threw
around
scintillations
of
sky
-
light
as
its
owner
swung
along
upon
a
pair
of
thin
legs
and
noiseless
boots

jude
,
beginning
to
feel
lonely
,
endeavoured
to
keep
up
with
him
.
"
well
,
my
man
!
i
am
in
a
hurry
,
so
you
will
have
to
walk
pretty
fast

"
vilbert
was
an
itinerant
quack
-
doctor
,
well
known
to
the
rustic
population
,
and
absolutely
unknown
to
anybody
else
,
as
he
,
indeed
,
took
care
to
be
,
to
avoid
inconvenient
investigations
.
cottagers
formed
his
only
patients
,
and
his
wessex
-
wide
repute
was
among
them
alone
.
his
position
was
humbler
and
his
field
more
obscure
than
those
of
the
quacks
with
capital
and
an
organized
system
of
advertising
.
he
was
,
in
fact
,
a
survival
.
the
distances
he
traversed
on
foot
were
enormous
,
and
extended
nearly
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
wessex
.
jude
had
one
day
seen
him
selling
a
pot
of
coloured
lard
to
an
old
woman
as
a
certain
cure
for
a
bad
leg
,
the
woman
arranging
to
pay
a
guinea
,
in
instalments
of
a
shilling
a
fortnight
,
for
the
precious
salve
,
which
,
according
to
the
physician
,
could
only
be
obtained
from
a
particular
animal
which
grazed
on
mount
sinai
,
and
was
to
be
captured
only
at
great
risk
to
life
and
limb

jude
,
though
he
already
had
his
doubts
about

gentleman

felt
him
to

unquestionably
a

said

gratefully
,
but
in
gasps
,
for
the
amazing
speed
of
the
physician
'
s
walk
kept
him
in
a
dog

trot

was
giving
him
a

side

"
"
where
will
you
be
with
the
grammars
?
"
"
i
shall
be
passing
here
this
day
fortnight
at
precisely
this
hour
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
minutes
past
seven
.
my
movements
are
as
truly
timed
as
those
of
the
planets
in
their
courses
.
"
"
here
i
will
be
to
meet
you
,
"
said
jude
.
"
with
orders
for
my
medicines
?
"
"
yes
,
physician
.
"
jude
then
dropped
behind
,
waited
a
few
minutes
to
recover
breath
,
and
went
home
with
a
consciousness
of
having
struck
a
blow
for
christminster
.
through
the
intervening
fortnight
he
ran
about
and
smiled
outwardly
at
his
inward
thoughts
,
as
if
they
were
people
meeting
and
nodding
to
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
smiled
with
that
singularly
beautiful
irradiation
which
is
seen
to
spread
on
young
faces
at
the
inception
of
some
glorious
idea
,
as
if
a
supernatural
lamp
were
held
inside
their
transparent
natures
,
giving
rise
to
the
flattering
fancy
that
heaven
lies
about
them
then
.
he
honestly
performed
his
promise
to
the
man
of
many
cures
,
in
whom
he
now
sincerely
believed
,
walking
miles
hither
and
thither
among
the
surrounding
hamlets
as
the
physician
'
s
agent
in
advance
.
on
the
evening
appointed
he
stood
motionless
on
the
plateau
,
at
the
place
where
he
had
parted
from
vilbert
,
and
there
awaited
his
approach
.
the
road
-
physician
was
fairly
up
to
time
;
but
,
to
the
surprise
of
jude
on
striking
into
his
pace
,
which
the
pedestrian
did
not
diminish
by
a
single
unit
of
force
,
the
latter
seemed
hardly
to
recognize
his
young
companion
,
though
with
the
lapse
of
the
fortnight
the
evenings
had
grown
light
.
jude
thought
it
might
perhaps
be
owing
to
his
wearing
another
hat
,
and
he
saluted
the
physician
with
dignity
.
"
well
,
my
boy
?
"
said
the
latter
abstractedly
.
"
i
'
ve
come
,
"
said
jude
.
"
you
?
who
are
you
?
oh
yes
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
be
sure
!
got
any
orders
,
lad
?
"
"
yes
.
"
and
jude
told
him
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
cottagers
who
were
willing
to
test
the
virtues
of
the
world
-
renowned
pills
and
salve
.
the
quack
mentally
registered
these
with
great
care
.
"
and
the
latin
and
greek
grammars
?
"
jude
'
s
voice
trembled
with
anxiety
.
"
what
about
them
?
"
"
you
were
to
bring
me
yours
,
that
you
used
before
you
took
your
degree
.
"
"
ah
,
yes
,
yes
!
forgot
all
about
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
all
!
so
many
lives
depending
on
my
attention
,
you
see
,
my
man
,
that
i
ca
not
give
so
much
thought
as
i
would
like
to
other
things
.
"
jude
controlled
himself
sufficiently
long
to
make
sure
of
the
truth
;
and
he
repeated
,
in
a
voice
of
dry
misery
,
"
you
have
not
brought
'
em
!
"
"
no
.
but
you
must
get
me
some
more
orders
from
sick
people
,
and
i
will
bring
the
grammars
next
time
.
"
jude
dropped
behind
.
he
was
an
unsophisticated
boy
,
but
the
gift
of
sudden
insight
which
is
sometimes
vouchsafed
to
children
showed
him
all
at
once
what
shoddy
humanity
the
quack
was
made
of
.
there
was
to
be
no
intellectual
light
from
this
source
.
the
leaves
dropped
from
his
imaginary
crown
of
laurel
;
he
turned
to
a
gate
,
leant
against
it
,
and
cried
bitterly
.
the
disappointment
was
followed
by
an
interval
of
blankness
.
he
might
,
perhaps
,
have
obtained
grammars
from
alfredston
,
but
to
do
that
required
money
,
and
a
knowledge
of
what
books
to
order
;
and
though
physically
comfortable
,
he
was
in
such
absolute
dependence
as
to
be
without
a
farthing
of
his
own
.
at
this
date
mr
phillotson
sent
for
his
pianoforte
,
and
it
gave
jude
a
lead
.
why
should
he
not
write
to
the
schoolmaster
,
and
ask
him
to
be
so
kind
as
to
get
him
the
grammars
in
christminster
?
he
might
slip
a
letter
inside
the
case
of
the
instrument
,
and
it
would
be
sure
to
reach
the
desired
eyes
.
why
not
ask
him
to
send
any
old
second
-
hand
copies
,
which
would
have
the
charm
of
being
mellowed
by
the
university
atmosphere
?
to
tell
his
aunt
of
his
intention
would
be
to
defeat
it
.
it
was
necessary
to
act
alone
.
after
a
further
consideration
of
a
few
days
he
did
act
,
and
on
the
day
of
the
piano
'
s
departure
,
which
happened
to
be
his
next
birthday
,
clandestinely
placed
the
letter
inside
the
packing
-
case
,
directed
to
his
much
-
admired
friend
,
being
afraid
to
reveal
the
operation
to
his
aunt
drusilla
,
lest
she
should
discover
his
motive
,
and
compel
him
to
abandon
his
scheme
.
the
piano
was
despatched
,
and
jude
waited
days
and
weeks
,
calling
every
morning
at
the
cottage
post
office
before
his
great
-
aunt
was
stirring
.
at
last
a
packet
did
indeed
arrive
at
the
village
,
and
he
saw
from
the
ends
of
it
that
it
contained
two
thin
books
.
he
took
it
away
into
a
lonely
place
,
and
sat
down
on
a
felled
elm
to
open
it
.
ever
since
his
first
ecstasy
or
vision
of
christminster
and
its
possibilities
,
jude
had
meditated
much
and
curiously
on
the
probable
sort
of
process
that
was
involved
in
turning
the
expressions
of
one
language
into
those
of
another
.
he
concluded
that
a
grammar
of
the
required
tongue
would
contain
,
primarily
,
a
rule
,
prescription
,
or
clue
of
the
nature
of
a
secret
cipher
,
which
,
once
known
,
would
enable
him
,
by
merely
applying
it
,
to
change
at
will
all
words
of
his
own
speech
into
those
of
the
foreign
one
.
his
childish
idea
was
,
in
fact
,
a
pushing
to
the
extremity
of
mathematical
precision
what
is
everywhere
known
as
grimm
'
s
law
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
an
aggrandizement
of
rough
rules
to
ideal
completeness
.
thus
he
assumed
that
the
words
of
the
required
language
were
always
to
be
found
somewhere
latent
in
the
words
of
the
given
language
by
those
who
had
the
art
to
uncover
them
,
such
art
being
furnished
by
the
books
aforesaid
.
when
,
therefore
,
having
noted
that
the
packet
bore
the
postmark
of
christminster
,
he
cut
the
string
,
opened
the
volumes
,
and
turned
to
the
latin
grammar
,
which
chanced
to
come
uppermost
,
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
.
the
book
was
an
old
one
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
thirty
years
old
,
soiled
,
scribbled
wantonly
over
with
a
strange
name
in
every
variety
of
enmity
to
the
letterpress
,
and
marked
at
random
with
dates
twenty
years
earlier
than
his
own
day
.
but
this
was
not
the
cause
of
jude
'
s
amazement
.
he
learnt
for
the
first
time
that
there
was
no
law
of
transmutation
,
as
in
his
innocence
he
had
supposed
(
there
was
,
in
some
degree
,
but
the
grammarian
did
not
recognize
it
)
,
but
that
every
word
in
both
latin
and
greek
was
to
be
individually
committed
to
memory
at
the
cost
of
years
of
plodding
.
jude
flung
down
the
books
,
lay
backward
along
the
broad
trunk
of
the
elm
,
and
was
an
utterly
miserable
boy
for
the
space
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
as
he
had
often
done
before
,
he
pulled
his
hat
over
his
face
and
watched
the
sun
peering
insidiously
at
him
through
the
interstices
of
the
straw
.
this
was
latin
and
greek
,
then
,
was
it
this
grand
delusion
!
the
charm
he
had
supposed
in
store
for
him
was
really
a
labour
like
that
of
israel
in
egypt
.
what
brains
they
must
have
in
christminster
and
the
great
schools
,
he
presently
thought
,
to
learn
words
one
by
one
up
to
tens
of
thousands
!
there
were
no
brains
in
his
head
equal
to
this
business
;
and
as
the
little
sun
-
rays
continued
to
stream
in
through
his
hat
at
him
,
he
wished
he
had
never
seen
a
book
,
that
he
might
never
see
another
,
that
he
had
never
been
born
.
somebody
might
have
come
along
that
way
who
would
have
asked
him
his
trouble
,
and
might
have
cheered
him
by
saying
that
his
notions
were
further
advanced
than
those
of
his
grammarian
.
but
nobody
did
come
,
because
nobody
does
;
and
under
the
crushing
recognition
of
his
gigantic
error
jude
continued
to
wish
himself
out
of
the
world
.
during
the
three
or
four
succeeding
years
a
quaint
and
singular
vehicle
might
have
been
discerned
moving
along
the
lanes
and
by
-
roads
near
marygreen
,
driven
in
a
quaint
and
singular
way
.
in
the
course
of
a
month
or
two
after
the
receipt
of
the
books
jude
had
grown
callous
to
the
shabby
trick
played
him
by
the
dead
languages
.
in
fact
,
his
disappointment
at
the
nature
of
those
tongues
had
,
after
a
while
,
been
the
means
of
still
further
glorifying
the
erudition
of
christminster
.
to
acquire
languages
,
departed
or
living
in
spite
of
such
obstinacies
as
he
now
knew
them
inherently
to
possess
,
was
a
herculean
performance
which
gradually
led
him
on
to
a
greater
interest
in
it
than
in
the
presupposed
patent
process
.
the
mountain
-
weight
of
material
under
which
the
ideas
lay
in
those
dusty
volumes
called
the
classics
piqued
him
into
a
dogged
,
mouselike
subtlety
of
attempt
to
move
it
piecemeal
.
he
had
endeavoured
to
make
his
presence
tolerable
to
his
crusty
maiden
aunt
by
assisting
her
to
the
best
of
his
ability
,
and
the
business
of
the
little
cottage
bakery
had
grown
in
consequence
.
an
aged
horse
with
a
hanging
head
had
been
purchased
for
eight
pounds
at
a
sale
,
a
creaking
cart
with
a
whity
-
brown
tilt
obtained
for
a
few
pounds
more
,
and
in
this
turn
-
out
it
became
jude
'
s
business
thrice
a
week
to
carry
loaves
of
bread
to
the
villagers
and
solitary
cotters
immediately
round
marygreen
.
the
singularity
aforesaid
lay
,
after
all
,
less
in
the
conveyance
itself
than
in
jude
'
s
manner
of
conducting
it
along
its
route
.
its
interior
was
the
scene
of
most
of
jude
'
s
education
by
"
private
study
.
"
as
soon
as
the
horse
had
learnt
the
road
and
the
houses
at
which
he
was
to
pause
awhile
,
the
boy
,
seated
in
front
,
would
slip
the
reins
over
his
arm
,
ingeniously
fix
open
,
by
means
of
a
strap
attached
to
the
tilt
,
the
volume
he
was
reading
,
spread
the
dictionary
on
his
knees
,
and
plunge
into
the
simpler
passages
from
caesar
,
virgil
,
or
horace
,
as
the
case
might
be
,
in
his
purblind
stumbling
way
,
and
with
an
expenditure
of
labour
that
would
have
made
a
tender
-
hearted
pedagogue
shed
tears
;
yet
somehow
getting
at
the
meaning
of
what
he
read
,
and
divining
rather
than
beholding
the
spirit
of
the
original
,
which
often
to
his
mind
was
something
else
than
that
which
he
was
taught
to
look
for
.
the
only
copies
he
had
been
able
to
lay
hands
on
were
old
delphin
editions
,
because
they
were
superseded
,
and
therefore
cheap
.
but
,
bad
for
idle
schoolboys
,
it
did
so
happen
that
they
were
passably
good
for
him
.
the
hampered
and
lonely
itinerant
conscientiously
covered
up
the
marginal
readings
,
and
used
them
merely
on
points
of
construction
,
as
he
would
have
used
a
comrade
or
tutor
who
should
have
happened
to
be
passing
by
.
and
though
jude
may
have
had
little
chance
of
becoming
a
scholar
by
these
rough
and
ready
means
,
he
was
in
the
way
of
getting
into
the
groove
he
wished
to
follow
.
while
he
was
busied
with
these
ancient
pages
,
which
had
already
been
thumbed
by
hands
possibly
in
the
grave
,
digging
out
the
thoughts
of
these
minds
so
remote
yet
so
near
,
the
bony
old
horse
pursued
his
rounds
,
and
jude
would
be
aroused
from
the
woes
of
dido
by
the
stoppage
of
his
cart
and
the
voice
of
some
old
woman
crying
,
"
two
to
-
day
,
baker
,
and
i
return
this
stale
one
.
"
he
was
frequently
met
in
the
lanes
by
pedestrians
and
others
without
his
seeing
them
,
and
by
degrees
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
began
to
talk
about
his
method
of
combining
work
and
play
(
such
they
considered
his
reading
to
be
)
,
which
,
though
probably
convenient
enough
to
himself
,
was
not
altogether
a
safe
proceeding
for
other
travellers
along
the
same
roads
.
there
were
murmurs
.
then
a
private
resident
of
an
adjoining
place
informed
the
local
policeman
that
the
baker
'
s
boy
should
not
be
allowed
to
read
while
driving
,
and
insisted
that
it
was
the
constable
'
s
duty
to
catch
him
in
the
act
,
and
take
him
to
the
police
court
at
alfredston
,
and
get
him
fined
for
dangerous
practices
on
the
highway
.
the
policeman
thereupon
lay
in
wait
for
jude
,
and
one
day
accosted
him
and
cautioned
him
.
as
jude
had
to
get
up
at
three
o
'
clock
in
the
morning
to
heat
the
oven
,
and
mix
and
set
in
the
bread
that
he
distributed
later
in
the
day
,
he
was
obliged
to
go
to
bed
at
night
immediately
after
laying
the
sponge
;
so
that
if
he
could
not
read
his
classics
on
the
highways
he
could
hardly
study
at
all
.
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
,
therefore
,
to
keep
a
sharp
eye
ahead
and
around
him
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
circumstances
,
and
slip
away
his
books
as
soon
as
anybody
loomed
in
the
distance
,
the
policeman
in
particular
.
to
do
that
official
justice
,
he
did
not
put
himself
much
in
the
way
of
jude
'
s
bread
-
cart
,
considering
that
in
such
a
lonely
district
the
chief
danger
was
to
jude
himself
,
and
often
on
seeing
the
white
tilt
over
the
hedges
he
would
move
in
another
direction
.
on
a
day
when
fawley
was
getting
quite
advanced
,
being
now
about
sixteen
,
and
had
been
stumbling
through
the
"
carmen
saeculare
,
"
on
his
way
home
,
he
found
himself
to
be
passing
over
the
high
edge
of
the
plateau
by
the
brown
house
.
the
light
had
changed
,
and
it
was
the
sense
of
this
which
had
caused
him
to
look
up
.
the
sun
was
going
down
,
and
the
full
moon
was
rising
simultaneously
behind
the
woods
in
the
opposite
quarter
.
his
mind
had
become
so
impregnated
with
the
poem
that
,
in
a
moment
of
the
same
impulsive
emotion
which
years
before
had
caused
him
to
kneel
on
the
ladder
,
he
stopped
the
horse
,
alighted
,
and
glancing
round
to
see
that
nobody
was
in
sight
,
knelt
down
on
the
roadside
bank
with
open
book
.
he
turned
first
to
the
shiny
goddess
,
who
seemed
to
look
so
softly
and
critically
at
his
doings
,
then
to
the
disappearing
luminary
on
the
other
hand
,
as
he
began
:
"
phoebe
silvarumque
potens
diana
!
"
the
horse
stood
still
till
he
had
finished
the
hymn
,
which
jude
repeated
under
the
sway
of
a
polytheistic
fancy
that
he
would
never
have
thought
of
humouring
in
broad
daylight
.
reaching
home
,
he
mused
over
his
curious
superstition
,
innate
or
acquired
,
in
doing
this
,
and
the
strange
forgetfulness
which
had
led
to
such
a
lapse
from
common
sense
and
custom
in
one
who
wished
,
next
to
being
a
scholar
,
to
be
a
christian
divine
.
it
had
all
come
of
reading
heathen
works
exclusively
.
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
convinced
he
was
of
his
inconsistency
.
he
began
to
wonder
whether
he
could
be
reading
quite
the
right
books
for
his
object
in
life
.
certainly
there
seemed
little
harmony
between
this
pagan
literature
and
the
mediaeval
colleges
at
christminster
,
that
ecclesiastical
romance
in
stone
.
ultimately
he
decided
that
in
his
sheer
love
of
reading
he
had
taken
up
a
wrong
emotion
for
a
christian
young
man
.
he
had
dabbled
in
clarke
'
s
homer
,
but
had
never
yet
worked
much
at
the
new
testament
in
the
greek
,
though
he
possessed
a
copy
,
obtained
by
post
from
a
second
-
hand
bookseller
.
he
abandoned
the
now
familiar
ionic
for
a
new
dialect
,
and
for
a
long
time
onward
limited
his
reading
almost
entirely
to
the
gospels
and
epistles
in
griesbach
'
s
text
.
moreover
,
on
going
into
alfredston
one
day
,
he
was
introduced
to
patristic
literature
by
finding
at
the
bookseller
'
s
some
volumes
of
the
fathers
which
had
been
left
behind
by
an
insolvent
clergyman
of
the
neighbourhood
.
as
another
outcome
of
this
change
of
groove
he
visited
on
sundays
all
the
churches
within
a
walk
,
and
deciphered
the
latin
inscriptions
on
fifteenth
-
century
brasses
and
tombs
.
on
one
of
these
pilgrimages
he
met
with
a
hunch
-
backed
old
woman
of
great
intelligence
,
who
read
everything
she
could
lay
her
hands
on
,
and
she
told
him
more
yet
of
the
romantic
charms
of
the
city
of
light
and
lore
.
thither
he
resolved
as
firmly
as
ever
to
go
.
but
how
live
in
that
city
?
at
present
he
had
no
income
at
all
.
he
had
no
trade
or
calling
of
any
dignity
or
stability
whatever
on
which
he
could
subsist
while
carrying
out
an
intellectual
labour
which
might
spread
over
many
years
.
what
was
most
required
by
citizens
?
food
,
clothing
,
and
shelter
.
an
income
from
any
work
in
preparing
the
first
would
be
too
meagre
;
for
making
the
second
he
felt
a
distaste
;
the
preparation
of
the
third
requisite
he
inclined
to
.
they
built
in
a
city
;
therefore
he
would
learn
to
build
.
he
thought
of
his
unknown
uncle
,
his
cousin
susanna
'
s
father
,
an
ecclesiastical
worker
in
metal
,
and
somehow
mediaeval
art
in
any
material
was
a
trade
for
which
he
had
rather
a
fancy
.
he
could
not
go
far
wrong
in
following
his
uncle
'
s
footsteps
,
and
engaging
himself
awhile
with
the
carcases
that
contained
the
scholar
souls
.
as
a
preliminary
he
obtained
some
small
blocks
