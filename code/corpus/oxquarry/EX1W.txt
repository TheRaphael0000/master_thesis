in
the
meanwhile
silence
had
fallen
over
the
beautiful
old
manorial
house
one
by
one
the
guests
had
departed
leaving
that
peaceful
sense
of
complete
calm
and
isolation
which
follows
the
noisy
chatter
of
any
great
throng
bent
chiefly
on
enjoyment
the
evening
had
been
universally
acknowledged
to
have
been
brilliantly
successful
true
the
much
talked
of
french
artiste
had
not
sung
the
promised
ditties
but
in
the
midst
of
the
whirl
and
excitement
of
dances
of
the
inspiring
tunes
of
the
string
band
the
elaborate
supper
and
recherche
wines
no
one
had
paid
much
heed
to
this
change
in
the
programme
of
entertainments
and
everyone
had
agreed
that
never
had
lady
blakeney
looked
more
radiantly
beautiful
than
on
this
night
she
seemed
absolutely
indefatigable
a
perfect
hostess
full
of
charming
little
attentions
towards
every
one
although
more
than
ordinarily
absorbed
by
her
duties
towards
her
many
royal
guests
the
dramatic
incidents
which
had
taken
place
in
the
small
boudoir
had
not
been
much
bruited
abroad
it
was
always
considered
bad
form
in
those
courtly
days
to
discuss
men
'
s
quarrels
before
ladies
and
in
this
instance
those
who
were
present
when
it
all
occurred
instinctively
felt
that
their
discretion
would
be
appreciated
in
high
circles
and
held
their
tongues
accordingly
thus
the
brilliant
evening
was
brought
to
a
happy
conclusion
without
a
single
cloud
to
mar
the
enjoyment
of
the
guests
marguerite
performed
a
veritable
miracle
of
fortitude
forcing
her
very
smiles
to
seem
natural
and
gay
chatting
pleasantly
even
wittily
upon
every
known
fashionable
topic
of
the
day
laughing
merrily
the
while
her
poor
aching
heart
was
filled
with
unspeakable
misery
now
when
everybody
had
gone
when
the
last
of
her
guests
had
bobbed
before
her
the
prescribed
curtsey
to
which
she
had
invariably
responded
with
the
same
air
of
easy
self
-
possession
now
at
last
she
felt
free
to
give
rein
to
her
thoughts
to
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
looking
her
own
anxiety
straight
in
the
face
and
to
let
the
tension
of
her
nerves
relax
sir
andrew
ffoulkes
had
been
the
last
to
leave
and
percy
had
strolled
out
with
him
as
far
as
the
garden
gate
for
lady
ffoulkes
had
left
in
her
chaise
some
time
ago
and
sir
andrew
meant
to
walk
to
his
home
not
many
yards
distant
from
blakeney
manor
in
spite
of
herself
marguerite
felt
her
heartstrings
tighten
as
she
thought
of
this
young
couple
so
lately
wedded
people
smiled
a
little
when
sir
andrew
ffoulkes
'
name
was
mentioned
some
called
him
effeminate
other
uxorious
his
fond
attachment
for
his
pretty
little
wife
was
thought
to
pass
the
bounds
of
decorum
there
was
no
doubt
that
since
his
marriage
the
young
man
had
greatly
changed
his
love
of
sport
and
adventure
seemed
to
have
died
out
completely
yielding
evidently
to
the
great
more
overpowering
love
that
for
his
young
wife
suzanne
was
nervous
for
her
husband
'
s
safety
she
had
sufficient
influence
over
him
to
keep
him
at
home
when
other
members
of
the
brave
little
league
of
the
scarlet
pimpernel
followed
their
leader
with
mad
zest
on
some
bold
adventure
marguerite
too
at
first
had
smiled
in
kindly
derision
when
suzanne
ffoulkes
her
large
eyes
filled
with
tears
had
used
her
wiles
to
keep
sir
andrew
tied
to
her
own
dainty
apron
strings
but
somehow
lately
with
that
gentle
contempt
which
she
felt
for
the
weaker
man
there
had
mingled
a
half
-
acknowledged
sense
of
envy
how
different
'
twixt
her
and
her
husband
percy
loved
her
truly
and
with
a
depth
of
passion
proportionate
to
his
own
curious
dual
personality
it
were
sacrilege
almost
to
doubt
the
intensity
of
his
love
but
nevertheless
she
had
at
all
times
a
feeling
as
if
he
were
holding
himself
and
his
emotions
in
check
as
if
his
love
as
if
she
marguerite
his
wife
were
but
secondary
matters
in
his
life
as
if
her
anxieties
her
sorrow
when
he
left
her
her
fears
for
his
safety
were
but
small
episodes
in
the
great
book
of
life
which
he
had
planned
out
and
conceived
for
himself
then
she
would
hate
herself
for
such
thoughts
they
seemed
like
doubts
of
him
did
any
man
ever
love
a
woman
she
asked
herself
as
percy
loved
her
he
was
difficult
to
understand
and
perhaps
oh
that
was
an
awful
perhaps
perhaps
there
lurked
somewhere
in
his
mind
a
slight
mistrust
of
her
she
had
betrayed
him
once
unwittingly
'
tis
true
did
he
fear
she
might
do
so
again
and
to
-
night
after
her
guests
had
gone
she
threw
open
the
great
windows
that
gave
on
the
beautiful
terrace
with
its
marble
steps
leading
down
to
the
cool
river
beyond
everything
now
seemed
so
peaceful
and
still
the
scent
of
the
heliotrope
made
the
midnight
air
swoon
with
its
intoxicating
fragrance
the
rhythmic
murmur
of
the
waters
came
gently
echoing
from
below
and
from
far
away
there
came
the
melancholy
cry
of
a
night
-
bird
on
the
prowl
that
cry
made
marguerite
shudder
her
thoughts
flew
back
to
the
episodes
of
this
night
and
to
chauvelin
the
dark
bird
of
prey
with
his
mysterious
death
-
dealing
plans
his
subtle
intrigues
which
all
tended
towards
the
destruction
of
one
man
his
enemy
the
husband
whom
marguerite
loved
oh
how
she
hated
these
wild
adventures
which
took
percy
away
from
her
side
is
not
a
woman
who
loves
be
it
husband
or
child
the
most
truly
selfish
the
most
cruelly
callous
creature
in
the
world
there
where
the
safety
and
the
well
-
being
of
the
loved
one
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
safety
and
well
-
being
of
others
she
would
right
gladly
have
closed
her
eyes
to
every
horror
perpetrated
in
france
she
would
not
have
known
what
went
on
in
paris
she
wanted
her
husband
and
yet
month
after
month
with
but
short
intervals
she
saw
him
risk
that
precious
life
of
his
which
was
the
very
essence
of
her
own
soul
for
others
for
others
always
for
others
and
she
she
marguerite
his
wife
was
powerless
to
hold
him
back
powerless
to
keep
him
beside
her
when
that
mad
fit
of
passion
seized
him
to
go
on
one
of
those
wild
quests
wherefrom
she
always
feared
he
could
not
return
alive
and
this
although
she
might
use
every
noble
artifice
every
tender
wile
of
which
a
loving
and
beautiful
wife
is
capable
at
times
like
those
her
own
proud
heart
was
filled
with
hatred
and
with
envy
towards
everything
that
took
him
away
from
her
and
to
-
night
all
these
passionate
feelings
which
she
felt
were
quite
unworthy
of
her
and
of
him
seemed
to
surge
within
her
soul
more
tumultuously
than
ever
she
was
longing
to
throw
herself
in
his
arms
to
pour
out
into
his
loving
ear
all
that
she
suffered
in
fear
and
anxiety
and
to
make
one
more
appeal
to
his
tenderness
and
to
that
passion
which
had
so
often
made
him
forget
the
world
at
her
feet
and
so
instinctively
she
walked
along
the
terrace
towards
that
more
secluded
part
of
the
garden
just
above
the
river
bank
where
she
had
so
oft
wandered
hand
in
hand
with
him
in
the
honeymoon
of
their
love
there
great
clumps
of
old
-
fashioned
cabbage
roses
grew
in
untidy
splendour
and
belated
lilies
sent
intoxicating
odours
into
the
air
whilst
the
heavy
masses
of
egyptian
and
michaelmas
daisies
looked
like
ghostly
constellations
in
the
gloom
she
thought
percy
must
soon
be
coming
this
way
though
it
was
so
late
she
knew
that
he
would
not
go
to
bed
after
the
events
of
the
night
his
ruling
passion
strong
in
death
would
be
holding
him
in
its
thrall
she
too
felt
wide
awake
and
unconscious
of
fatigue
when
she
reached
the
secluded
path
beside
the
river
she
peered
eagerly
up
and
down
and
listened
for
a
sound
presently
it
seemed
to
her
that
above
the
gentle
clapper
of
the
waters
she
could
hear
a
rustle
and
the
scrunching
of
the
fine
gravel
under
carefully
measured
footsteps
she
waited
a
while
the
footsteps
seemed
to
draw
nearer
and
soon
although
the
starlit
night
was
very
dark
she
perceived
a
cloaked
and
hooded
figure
approaching
cautiously
toward
her
who
goes
there
she
called
suddenly
the
figure
paused
then
came
rapidly
forward
and
a
voice
said
timidly
ah
lady
blakeney
who
are
you
asked
marguerite
peremptorily
it
is
i
desiree
candeille
replied
the
midnight
prowler
demoiselle
candeille
ejaculated
marguerite
wholly
taken
by
surprise
what
are
you
doing
here
alone
and
at
this
hour
sh
-
sh
-
sh
whispered
candeille
eagerly
as
she
approached
quite
close
to
marguerite
and
drew
her
hood
still
lower
over
her
eyes
i
am
all
alone
i
wanted
to
see
someone
you
if
possible
lady
blakeney
for
i
could
not
rest
i
wanted
to
know
what
had
happened
what
had
happened
when
i
do
not
understand
what
happened
between
citizen
chauvelin
and
your
husband
asked
candeille
what
is
that
to
you
replied
marguerite
haughtily
i
pray
you
do
not
misunderstand
me
pleaded
candeille
eagerly
i
know
my
presence
in
your
house
the
quarrel
which
i
provoked
must
have
filled
your
heart
with
hatred
and
suspicion
towards
me
but
oh
how
can
i
persuade
you
i
acted
unwillingly
will
you
not
believe
me
i
was
that
man
'
s
tool
and
oh
god
she
added
with
sudden
wild
vehemence
if
only
you
could
know
what
tyranny
that
accursed
government
of
france
exercises
over
poor
helpless
women
or
men
who
happen
to
have
fallen
within
reach
of
its
relentless
clutches
her
voice
broke
down
in
a
sob
marguerite
hardly
knew
what
to
say
or
think
she
had
always
mistrusted
this
woman
with
her
theatrical
ways
and
stagy
airs
from
the
very
first
moment
she
saw
her
in
the
tent
on
the
green
and
she
did
not
wish
to
run
counter
against
her
instinct
in
anything
pertaining
to
the
present
crisis
and
yet
in
spite
of
her
mistrust
the
actress
'
vehement
words
found
an
echo
in
the
depths
of
her
own
heart
how
well
she
knew
that
tyranny
of
which
candeille
spoke
with
such
bitterness
had
she
not
suffered
from
it
endured
terrible
sorrow
and
humiliation
when
under
the
ban
of
that
same
appalling
tyranny
she
had
betrayed
the
identity
then
unknown
to
her
of
the
scarlet
pimpernel
therefore
when
candeille
paused
after
those
last
excited
words
she
said
with
more
gentleness
than
she
had
shown
hitherto
though
still
quite
coldly
but
you
have
not
yet
told
me
why
you
came
back
here
to
-
night
if
citizen
chauvelin
was
your
taskmaster
then
you
must
know
all
that
has
occurred
i
had
a
vague
hope
that
i
might
see
you
for
what
purpose
to
warn
you
if
i
could
i
need
no
warning
or
are
too
proud
to
take
one
do
you
know
lady
blakeney
that
citizen
chauvelin
has
a
personal
hatred
against
your
husband
how
do
you
know
that
asked
marguerite
with
her
suspicions
once
more
on
the
qui
-
vive
she
could
not
understand
candeille
'
s
attitude
this
midnight
visit
the
vehemence
of
her
language
the
strange
mixture
of
knowledge
and
ignorance
which
she
displayed
what
did
this
woman
know
of
chauvelin
'
s
secret
plans
was
she
his
open
ally
or
his
helpless
tool
and
was
she
even
now
playing
a
part
taught
her
or
commanded
her
by
that
prince
of
intriguers
candeille
however
seemed
quite
unaware
of
the
spirit
of
antagonism
and
mistrust
which
marguerite
took
but
little
pains
now
to
disguise
she
clasped
her
hands
together
and
her
voice
shook
with
the
earnestness
of
her
entreaty
oh
she
said
eagerly
have
i
not
seen
that
look
of
hatred
in
chauvelin
'
s
cruel
eyes
he
hates
your
husband
i
tell
you
why
i
know
not
but
he
hates
him
and
means
that
great
harm
shall
come
to
sir
percy
through
this
absurd
duel
oh
lady
blakeney
do
not
let
him
go
i
entreat
you
do
not
let
him
go
but
marguerite
proudly
drew
back
a
step
or
two
away
from
the
reach
of
those
hands
stretched
out
towards
her
in
such
vehement
appeal
you
are
overwrought
mademoiselle
she
said
coldly
believe
me
i
have
no
need
either
of
your
entreaties
or
of
your
warning
i
should
like
you
to
think
that
i
have
no
wish
to
be
ungrateful
that
i
appreciate
any
kind
thought
you
may
have
harboured
for
me
in
your
mind
but
beyond
that
please
forgive
me
if
i
say
it
somewhat
crudely
i
do
not
feel
that
the
matter
concerns
you
in
the
least
the
hour
is
late
she
added
more
gently
as
if
desiring
to
attenuate
the
harshness
of
her
last
words
shall
i
send
my
maid
to
escort
you
home
she
is
devoted
and
discreet
nay
retorted
the
other
in
tones
of
quiet
sadness
there
is
no
need
of
discretion
i
am
not
ashamed
of
my
visit
to
you
to
-
night
you
are
very
proud
and
for
your
sake
i
will
pray
to
god
that
sorrow
and
humiliation
may
not
come
to
you
as
i
feared
we
are
never
likely
to
meet
again
lady
blakeney
you
will
not
wish
it
and
i
shall
have
passed
out
of
your
life
as
swiftly
as
i
had
entered
into
it
but
there
was
another
thought
lurking
in
my
mind
when
i
came
to
-
night
in
case
sir
percy
goes
to
france
the
duel
is
to
take
place
in
or
near
boulogne
this
much
i
do
know
would
you
not
wish
to
go
with
him
truly
mademoiselle
i
must
repeat
to
you
that
'
tis
no
concern
of
mine
i
know
i
own
that
but
you
see
when
i
came
back
here
to
-
night
in
the
silence
and
the
darkness
i
had
not
guessed
that
you
would
be
so
proud
i
thought
that
i
a
woman
would
know
how
to
touch
your
womanly
heart
i
was
clumsy
i
suppose
i
made
so
sure
that
you
would
wish
to
go
with
your
husband
in
case
in
case
he
insisted
on
running
his
head
into
the
noose
which
i
feel
sure
chauvelin
has
prepared
for
him
i
myself
start
for
france
shortly
citizen
chauvelin
has
provided
me
with
the
necessary
passport
for
myself
and
my
maid
who
was
to
have
accompanied
me
then
just
now
when
i
was
all
alone
and
thought
over
all
the
mischief
which
that
fiend
had
forced
me
to
do
for
him
it
seemed
to
me
that
perhaps
she
broke
off
abruptly
and
tried
to
read
the
other
woman
'
s
face
in
the
gloom
but
marguerite
who
was
taller
than
the
frenchwoman
was
standing
very
stiff
and
erect
giving
the
young
actress
neither
discouragement
nor
confidence
she
did
not
interrupt
candeille
'
s
long
and
voluble
explanation
vaguely
she
wondered
what
it
was
all
about
and
even
now
when
the
frenchwoman
paused
marguerite
said
nothing
but
watched
her
quietly
as
she
took
a
folded
paper
from
the
capacious
pocked
of
her
cloak
and
then
held
it
out
with
a
look
of
timidity
towards
lady
blakeney
my
maid
need
not
come
with
me
said
desiree
candeille
humbly
i
would
far
rather
travel
alone
this
is
her
passport
and
oh
you
need
not
take
it
out
of
my
hand
she
added
in
tones
of
bitter
self
-
deprecation
as
marguerite
made
no
sign
of
taking
the
paper
from
her
see
i
will
leave
it
here
among
the
roses
you
mistrust
me
now
it
is
only
natural
presently
perhaps
calmer
reflection
will
come
you
will
see
that
my
purpose
now
is
selfless
that
i
only
wish
to
serve
you
and
him
she
stooped
and
placed
the
folded
paper
in
the
midst
of
a
great
clump
of
centifolium
roses
and
then
without
another
word
she
turned
and
went
her
way
for
a
few
moments
whilst
marguerite
still
stood
there
puzzled
and
vaguely
moved
she
could
hear
the
gentle
frou
-
frou
of
the
other
woman
'
s
skirts
against
the
soft
sand
of
the
path
and
then
a
long
-
drawn
sigh
that
sounded
like
a
sob
then
all
was
still
again
the
gentle
midnight
breeze
caressed
the
tops
of
the
ancient
oaks
and
elms
behind
her
drawing
murmurs
from
their
dying
leaves
like
unto
the
whisperings
of
ghosts
marguerite
shuddered
with
a
slight
sense
of
cold
before
her
amongst
the
dark
clump
of
leaves
and
the
roses
invisible
in
the
gloom
there
fluttered
with
a
curious
melancholy
flapping
the
folded
paper
placed
there
by
candeille
she
watched
it
for
awhile
as
disturbed
by
the
wind
it
seemed
ready
to
take
its
flight
towards
the
river
anon
it
fell
to
the
ground
and
marguerite
with
sudden
overpowering
impulse
stooped
and
picked
it
up
then
clutching
it
nervously
in
her
hand
she
walked
rapidly
back
towards
the
house
as
she
neared
the
terrace
she
became
conscious
of
several
forms
moving
about
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
some
few
feet
below
where
she
was
standing
soon
she
saw
the
glimmer
of
lanthorns
heard
whispering
voices
and
the
lapping
of
the
water
against
the
side
of
a
boat
anon
a
figure
laden
with
cloaks
and
sundry
packages
passed
down
the
steps
close
beside
her
even
in
the
darkness
marguerite
recognized
benyon
her
husband
'
s
confidential
valet
without
a
moment
'
s
hesitation
she
flew
among
the
terrace
towards
the
wing
of
the
house
occupied
by
sir
percy
she
had
not
gone
far
before
she
discerned
his
tall
figure
walking
leisurely
along
the
path
which
here
skirted
part
of
the
house
he
had
on
his
large
caped
coat
which
was
thrown
open
in
front
displaying
a
grey
travelling
suit
of
fine
cloth
his
hands
were
as
usual
buried
in
the
pockets
of
his
breeches
and
on
his
head
he
wore
the
folding
chapeau
-
bras
which
he
habitually
affected
before
she
had
time
to
think
or
to
realize
that
he
was
going
before
she
could
utter
one
single
word
she
was
in
his
arms
clinging
to
him
with
passionate
intensity
trying
in
the
gloom
to
catch
every
expression
of
his
eyes
every
quiver
of
the
face
now
bent
down
so
close
to
her
percy
you
cannot
go
you
cannot
go
she
pleaded
she
had
felt
his
strong
arms
closing
round
her
his
lips
seeking
hers
her
eyes
her
hair
her
clinging
hands
which
dragged
at
his
shoulders
in
a
wild
agony
of
despair
if
you
really
loved
me
percy
she
murmured
you
would
not
go
you
would
not
go
he
would
not
trust
himself
to
speak
it
well
-
nigh
seemed
as
if
his
sinews
cracked
with
the
violent
effort
at
self
-
control
oh
how
she
loved
him
when
she
felt
in
him
the
passionate
lover
the
wild
untamed
creature
that
he
was
at
heart
on
whom
the
frigid
courtliness
of
manner
sat
but
as
a
thin
veneer
this
was
his
own
real
personality
and
there
was
little
now
of
the
elegant
and
accomplished
gentleman
of
fashion
schooled
to
hold
every
emotion
in
check
to
hide
every
thought
every
desire
save
that
for
amusement
or
for
display
she
feeling
her
power
and
his
weakness
now
gave
herself
wholly
to
his
embrace
not
grudging
one
single
passionate
caress
yielding
her
lips
to
him
the
while
she
murmured
you
cannot
go
you
cannot
why
should
you
go
it
is
madness
to
leave
me
i
cannot
let
you
go
her
arms
clung
tenderly
round
him
her
voice
was
warm
and
faintly
shaken
with
suppressed
tears
and
as
he
wildly
murmured
do
not
for
pity
'
s
sake
she
almost
felt
that
her
love
would
be
triumphant
for
pity
'
s
sake
i
will
go
on
pleading
percy
she
whispered
oh
my
love
my
dear
do
not
leave
me
we
have
scarce
had
time
to
savour
our
happiness
we
have
such
arrears
of
joy
to
make
up
do
not
go
percy
there
'
s
so
much
i
want
to
say
to
you
nay
you
shall
not
you
shall
not
she
added
with
sudden
vehemence
look
me
straight
in
the
eyes
my
dear
and
tell
me
if
you
can
leave
now
he
did
not
reply
but
almost
roughly
he
placed
his
hand
over
her
tear
-
dimmed
eyes
which
were
turned
up
to
his
in
an
agony
of
tender
appeal
thus
he
blindfolded
her
with
that
wild
caress
she
should
not
see
no
not
even
she
that
for
the
space
of
a
few
seconds
stern
manhood
was
well
-
nigh
vanquished
by
the
magic
of
her
love
all
that
was
most
human
in
him
all
that
was
weak
in
this
strong
and
untamed
nature
cried
aloud
for
peace
and
luxury
and
idleness
for
long
summer
afternoons
spent
in
lazy
content
for
the
companionship
of
horses
and
dogs
and
of
flowers
with
no
thought
or
cares
save
those
for
the
next
evening
'
s
gavotte
no
graver
occupation
save
that
of
sitting
at
her
feet
and
during
these
few
seconds
whilst
his
hand
lay
across
her
eyes
the
lazy
idle
fop
of
fashionable
london
was
fighting
a
hand
-
to
-
hand
fight
with
the
bold
leader
of
a
band
of
adventurers
and
his
own
passionate
love
for
his
wife
ranged
itself
with
fervent
intensity
on
the
side
of
his
weaker
self
forgotten
were
the
horrors
of
the
guillotine
the
calls
of
the
innocent
the
appeal
of
the
helpless
forgotten
the
daring
adventures
the
excitements
the
hair
'
s
-
breadth
escapes
for
those
few
seconds
heavenly
in
themselves
he
only
remembered
her
his
wife
her
beauty
and
her
tender
appeal
to
him
she
would
have
pleaded
again
for
she
felt
that
she
was
winning
in
this
fight
her
instinct
that
unerring
instinct
of
the
woman
who
loves
and
feels
herself
beloved
told
her
that
for
the
space
of
an
infinitesimal
fraction
of
time
his
iron
will
was
inclined
to
bend
but
he
checked
her
pleading
with
a
kiss
then
there
came
a
change
like
a
gigantic
wave
carried
inwards
by
the
tide
his
turbulent
emotion
seemed
suddenly
to
shatter
itself
against
a
rock
of
self
-
control
was
it
a
call
from
the
boatmen
below
a
distant
scrunching
of
feet
upon
the
gravel
who
knows
perhaps
only
a
sigh
in
the
midnight
air
a
ghostly
summons
from
the
land
of
dreams
that
recalled
him
to
himself
even
as
marguerite
was
still
clinging
to
him
with
the
ardent
fervour
of
her
own
passion
she
felt
the
rigid
tension
of
his
arms
relax
the
power
of
his
embrace
weaken
the
wild
love
-
light
become
dim
in
his
eyes
he
kissed
her
fondly
tenderly
and
with
infinite
gentleness
smoothed
away
the
little
damp
curls
from
her
brow
there
was
a
wistfulness
now
in
his
caress
and
in
his
kiss
there
was
the
finality
of
a
long
farewell
'
tis
time
i
went
he
said
or
we
shall
miss
the
tide
these
were
the
first
coherent
words
he
had
spoken
since
first
she
had
met
him
here
in
this
lonely
part
of
the
garden
and
his
voice
was
perfectly
steady
conventional
and
cold
an
icy
pang
shot
through
marguerite
'
s
heart
it
was
as
if
she
had
been
abruptly
wakened
from
a
beautiful
dream
you
are
not
going
percy
she
murmured
and
her
own
voice
now
sounded
hollow
and
forced
oh
if
you
loved
me
you
would
not
go
if
i
love
you
nay
in
this
at
least
there
was
no
dream
no
coldness
in
his
voice
when
he
repeated
those
words
with
such
a
sigh
of
tenderness
such
a
world
of
longing
that
the
bitterness
of
her
great
pain
vanished
giving
place
to
tears
he
took
her
hand
in
his
the
passion
was
momentarily
conquered
forced
within
his
innermost
soul
by
his
own
alter
ego
that
second
personality
in
him
the
cold
-
blooded
and
coolly
-
calculating
adventurer
who
juggled
with
his
life
and
tossed
it
recklessly
upon
the
sea
of
chance
'
twixt
a
doggerel
and
a
smile
but
the
tender
love
lingered
on
fighting
the
enemy
a
while
longer
the
wistful
desire
was
there
for
her
kiss
the
tired
longing
for
the
exquisite
repose
of
her
embrace
he
took
her
hand
in
his
and
bent
his
lips
to
it
and
with
the
warmth
of
his
kiss
upon
it
she
felt
a
moisture
like
a
tear
i
must
go
dear
he
said
after
a
little
while
why
why
she
repeated
obstinately
am
i
nothing
then
is
my
life
of
no
account
my
sorrows
my
fears
my
misery
oh
she
added
with
vehement
bitterness
why
should
it
always
be
others
what
are
others
to
you
and
to
me
percy
are
we
not
happy
here
have
you
not
fulfilled
to
its
uttermost
that
self
-
imposed
duty
to
people
who
can
be
nothing
to
us
is
not
your
life
ten
thousand
times
more
precious
to
me
than
the
lives
of
ten
thousand
others
even
through
the
darkness
and
because
his
face
was
so
close
to
hers
she
could
see
a
quaint
little
smile
playing
round
the
corners
of
his
mouth
nay
m
'
dear
he
said
gently
'
tis
not
ten
thousand
lives
that
call
to
me
to
-
day
only
one
at
best
do
not
you
hate
to
think
of
that
poor
little
old
cure
sitting
in
the
midst
of
his
ruined
pride
and
hopes
the
jewels
so
confidently
entrusted
to
his
care
stolen
from
him
he
waiting
perhaps
in
his
little
presbytery
for
the
day
when
those
brutes
will
march
him
to
prison
and
to
death
nay
i
think
a
little
sea
voyage
and
english
country
air
would
suit
the
abbe
foucquet
m
'
dear
and
i
only
mean
to
ask
him
to
cross
the
channel
with
me
percy
she
pleaded
oh
i
know
i
know
he
rejoined
with
that
short
deprecatory
sigh
of
his
which
seemed
always
to
close
any
discussion
between
them
on
that
point
you
are
thinking
of
that
absurd
duel
he
laughed
lightly
good
-
humouredly
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
merriment
la
m
'
dear
he
said
gaily
will
you
not
reflect
a
moment
could
i
refuse
the
challenge
before
his
royal
highness
and
the
ladies
i
could
not
faith
that
was
it
just
a
case
of
could
not
fate
did
it
all
the
quarrel
my
interference
the
challenge
he
had
planned
it
all
of
course
let
us
own
that
he
is
a
brave
man
seeing
that
he
and
i
are
not
even
yet
for
that
beating
he
gave
me
on
the
calais
cliffs
yes
he
has
planned
it
all
she
retorted
vehemently
the
quarrel
to
-
night
your
journey
to
france
your
meeting
with
him
face
to
face
at
a
given
hour
and
place
where
he
can
most
readily
most
easily
close
the
death
-
trap
upon
you
this
time
he
broke
into
a
laugh
a
good
hearty
laugh
full
of
the
joy
of
living
of
the
madness
and
intoxication
of
a
bold
adventure
a
laugh
that
had
not
one
particle
of
anxiety
or
of
tremor
in
it
nay
m
'
dear
he
said
but
your
ladyship
is
astonishing
close
a
death
-
trap
upon
your
humble
servant
nay
the
governing
citizens
of
france
will
have
to
be
very
active
and
mighty
wide
-
awake
ere
they
succeed
in
stealing
a
march
on
me
zounds
but
we
will
give
them
an
exciting
chase
this
time
nay
little
woman
do
not
fear
he
said
with
sudden
infinite
gentleness
those
demmed
murderers
have
not
got
me
yet
oh
how
often
she
had
fought
with
him
thus
with
him
the
adventurer
the
part
of
his
dual
nature
that
was
her
bitter
enemy
and
which
took
him
the
lover
away
from
her
side
she
knew
so
well
the
finality
of
it
all
the
amazing
hold
which
that
unconquerable
desire
for
these
mad
adventures
had
upon
him
impulsive
ardent
as
she
was
marguerite
felt
in
her
very
soul
an
overwhelming
fury
against
herself
for
her
own
weakness
her
own
powerlessness
in
the
face
of
that
which
forever
threatened
to
ruin
her
life
and
her
happiness
yes
and
his
also
for
he
loved
her
he
loved
her
he
loved
her
the
thought
went
on
hammering
in
her
mind
for
she
knew
of
its
great
truth
he
loved
her
and
went
away
and
she
poor
puny
weakling
was
unable
to
hold
him
back
the
tendrils
which
fastened
his
soul
to
hers
were
not
so
tenacious
as
those
which
made
him
cling
to
suffering
humanity
over
there
in
france
where
men
and
women
were
in
fear
of
death
and
torture
and
looked
upon
the
elusive
and
mysterious
scarlet
pimpernel
as
a
heaven
-
born
hero
sent
to
save
them
from
their
doom
to
them
at
these
times
his
very
heartstrings
seemed
to
turn
with
unconquerable
force
and
when
with
all
the
ardour
of
her
own
passion
she
tried
to
play
upon
the
cords
of
his
love
for
her
he
could
not
respond
for
they
the
strangers
had
the
stronger
claim
and
yet
through
it
all
she
knew
that
this
love
of
humanity
this
mad
desire
to
serve
and
to
help
in
no
way
detracted
from
his
love
for
her
nay
it
intensified
it
made
it
purer
and
better
adding
to
the
joy
of
perfect
intercourse
the
poetic
and
subtle
fragrance
of
ever
-
recurring
pain
but
now
at
last
she
felt
weary
of
the
fight
her
heart
was
aching
bruised
and
sore
an
infinite
fatigue
seemed
to
weigh
like
lead
upon
her
very
soul
this
seemed
so
different
to
any
other
parting
that
had
perforce
been
during
the
past
year
the
presence
of
chauvelin
in
her
house
the
obvious
planning
of
this
departure
for
france
had
filled
her
with
a
foreboding
nay
almost
a
certitude
of
a
gigantic
and
deadly
cataclysm
her
senses
began
to
reel
she
seemed
not
to
see
anything
very
distinctly
even
the
loved
form
took
on
a
strange
and
ghostlike
shape
he
now
looked
preternaturally
tall
and
there
was
a
mist
between
her
and
him
she
thought
that
he
spoke
to
her
again
but
she
was
not
quite
sure
for
his
voice
sounded
like
some
weird
and
mysterious
echo
a
bosquet
of
climbing
heliotrope
close
by
threw
a
fragrance
into
the
evening
air
which
turned
her
giddy
with
its
overpowering
sweetness
she
closed
her
eyes
for
she
felt
as
if
she
must
die
if
she
held
them
open
any
longer
and
as
she
closed
them
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
he
folded
her
in
one
last
long
heavenly
embrace
he
felt
her
graceful
figure
swaying
in
his
arms
like
a
tall
and
slender
lily
bending
to
the
wind
he
saw
that
she
was
but
half
-
conscious
and
thanked
heaven
for
this
kindly
solace
to
his
heart
-
breaking
farewell
there
was
a
sloping
mossy
bank
close
by
there
where
the
marble
terrace
yielded
to
the
encroaching
shrubbery
a
tangle
of
pale
pink
monthly
roses
made
a
bower
overhead
she
was
just
sufficiently
conscious
to
enable
him
to
lead
her
to
this
soft
green
couch
there
he
laid
her
amongst
the
roses
kissed
the
dear
tired
eyes
her
hands
her
lips
her
tiny
feet
and
went
the
rhythmic
clapper
of
oars
roused
marguerite
from
this
trance
-
like
swoon
in
a
moment
she
was
on
her
feet
all
her
fatigue
gone
her
numbness
of
soul
and
body
vanished
as
in
a
flash
she
was
fully
conscious
now
conscious
that
he
had
gone
that
according
to
every
probability
under
heaven
and
every
machination
concocted
in
hell
he
would
never
return
from
france
alive
and
that
she
had
failed
to
hear
the
last
words
which
he
spoke
to
her
had
failed
to
glean
his
last
look
or
to
savour
his
final
kiss
though
the
night
was
starlit
and
balmy
it
was
singularly
dark
and
vainly
did
marguerite
strain
her
eyes
to
catch
sight
of
that
boat
which
was
bearing
him
away
so
swiftly
now
she
strained
her
ears
vaguely
hoping
to
catch
one
last
lingering
echo
of
his
voice
but
all
was
silence
save
that
monotonous
clapper
which
seemed
to
beat
against
her
heart
like
a
rhythmic
knell
of
death
she
could
hear
the
oars
distinctly
there
were
six
or
eight
she
thought
certainly
no
fewer
eight
oarsmen
probably
which
meant
the
larger
boat
and
undoubtedly
the
longer
journey
not
to
london
only
with
a
view
to
posting
to
dover
but
to
tilbury
fort
where
the
day
dream
would
be
in
readiness
to
start
with
a
favourable
tide
thought
was
returning
to
her
slowly
and
coherently
the
pain
of
the
last
farewell
was
still
there
bruising
her
very
senses
with
its
dull
and
heavy
weight
but
it
had
become
numb
and
dead
leaving
her
herself
her
heart
and
soul
stunned
and
apathetic
whilst
her
brain
was
gradually
resuming
its
activity
and
the
more
she
thought
it
over
the
more
certain
she
grew
that
her
husband
was
going
as
far
as
tilbury
by
river
and
would
embark
on
the
day
dream
there
of
course
he
would
go
to
boulogne
at
once
the
duel
was
to
take
place
there
candeille
had
told
her
that
adding
that
she
thought
she
marguerite
would
wish
to
go
with
him
to
go
with
him
heavens
above
was
not
that
the
only
real
tangible
thought
in
that
whirling
chaos
which
was
raging
in
her
mind
to
go
with
him
surely
there
must
be
some
means
of
reaching
him
yet
fate
nature
god
himself
would
never
permit
so
monstrous
a
thing
as
this
that
she
should
be
parted
from
her
husband
now
when
his
life
was
not
only
in
danger
but
forfeited
already
lost
a
precious
thing
all
but
gone
from
this
world
percy
was
going
to
boulogne
she
must
go
too
by
posting
at
once
to
dover
she
could
get
the
tidal
boat
on
the
morrow
and
reach
the
french
coast
quite
as
soon
as
the
day
dream
once
at
boulogne
she
would
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
her
husband
of
that
she
felt
sure
she
would
have
but
to
dog
chauvelin
'
s
footsteps
find
out
something
of
his
plans
of
the
orders
he
gave
to
troops
or
to
spies
oh
she
would
find
him
of
that
she
was
never
for
a
moment
in
doubt
how
well
she
remembered
her
journey
to
calais
just
a
year
ago
in
company
with
sir
andrew
ffoulkes
chance
had
favoured
her
then
had
enabled
her
to
be
of
service
to
her
husband
if
only
by
distracting
chauvelin
'
s
attention
for
awhile
to
herself
heaven
knows
she
had
but
little
hope
of
being
of
use
to
him
now
an
aching
sense
was
in
her
that
fate
had
at
last
been
too
strong
that
the
daring
adventurer
had
staked
once
too
often
had
cast
the
die
and
had
lost
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
she
felt
the
sharp
edge
of
the
paper
left
for
her
by
desiree
candeille
among
the
roses
in
the
park
she
had
picked
it
up
almost
mechanically
then
and
tucked
it
away
hardly
heeding
what
she
was
doing
whatever
the
motive
of
the
french
actress
had
been
in
placing
the
passport
at
her
disposal
marguerite
blessed
her
in
her
heart
for
it
to
the
woman
she
had
mistrusted
she
would
owe
the
last
supreme
happiness
of
her
life
her
resolution
never
once
wavered
percy
would
not
take
her
with
him
that
was
understandable
she
could
neither
expect
it
nor
think
it
but
she
on
the
other
hand
could
not
stay
in
england
at
blakeney
manor
whilst
any
day
any
hour
the
death
-
trap
set
by
chauvelin
for
the
scarlet
pimpernel
might
be
closing
upon
the
man
whom
she
worshipped
she
would
go
mad
if
she
stayed
as
there
could
be
no
chance
of
escape
for
percy
now
as
he
had
agreed
to
meet
his
deadly
enemy
face
to
face
at
a
given
place
and
a
given
hour
she
could
not
be
a
hindrance
to
him
and
she
knew
enough
subterfuge
enough
machinations
and
disguises
by
now
to
escape
chauvelin
'
s
observation
unless
unless
percy
wanted
her
and
then
she
would
be
there
no
she
could
not
be
a
hindrance
she
had
a
passport
in
her
pocket
everything
en
regle
nobody
could
harm
her
and
she
could
come
and
go
as
she
pleased
there
were
plenty
of
swift
horses
in
the
stables
plenty
of
devoted
servants
to
do
her
bidding
quickly
and
discreetly
moreover
at
moments
like
these
conventionalities
and
the
possible
conjectures
and
surmises
of
others
became
of
infinitesimally
small
importance
the
household
of
blakeney
manor
were
accustomed
to
the
master
'
s
sudden
journeys
and
absences
of
several
days
presumably
on
some
shooting
or
other
sporting
expeditions
with
no
one
in
attendance
on
him
save
benyon
his
favourite
valet
these
passed
without
any
comments
now
bah
let
everyone
marvel
for
once
at
her
ladyship
'
s
sudden
desire
to
go
to
dover
and
let
it
all
be
a
nine
days
'
wonder
she
certainly
did
not
care
skirting
the
house
she
reached
the
stables
beyond
one
or
two
men
were
astir
to
these
she
gave
the
necessary
orders
for
her
coach
and
four
then
she
found
her
way
back
to
the
house
walking
along
the
corridor
she
went
past
the
room
occupied
by
juliette
de
marny
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
then
she
turned
and
knocked
at
the
door
juliette
was
not
yet
in
bed
for
she
went
to
the
door
herself
and
opened
it
obviously
she
had
been
quite
unable
to
rest
her
hair
was
falling
loosely
over
her
shoulders
and
there
was
a
look
of
grave
anxiety
on
her
young
face
juliette
said
marguerite
in
a
hurried
whisper
the
moment
she
had
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
she
and
the
young
girl
were
alone
i
am
going
to
france
to
be
near
my
husband
he
has
gone
to
meet
that
fiend
in
a
duel
which
is
nothing
but
a
trap
set
to
capture
him
and
lead
him
to
his
death
i
want
you
to
be
of
help
to
me
here
in
my
house
in
my
absence
i
would
give
my
life
for
you
lady
blakeney
said
juliette
simply
is
it
not
his
since
he
save
it
it
is
only
a
little
presence
of
mind
a
little
coolness
and
patience
which
i
will
ask
of
you
dear
said
marguerite
you
of
course
know
who
your
rescuer
was
therefore
you
will
understand
my
fears
until
to
-
night
i
had
vague
doubts
as
to
how
much
chauvelin
really
knew
but
now
these
doubts
have
naturally
vanished
he
and
the
french
revolutionary
government
know
that
the
scarlet
pimpernel
and
percy
blakeney
are
one
and
the
same
the
whole
scene
to
-
night
was
prearranged
you
and
i
and
all
the
spectators
and
that
woman
candeille
we
were
all
puppets
piping
to
that
devil
'
s
tune
the
duel
too
was
prearranged
that
woman
wearing
your
mother
'
s
jewels
had
you
not
provoked
her
a
quarrel
between
her
and
me
or
one
of
my
guests
would
have
been
forced
somehow
i
wanted
to
tell
you
this
lest
you
should
fret
and
think
that
you
were
in
any
way
responsible
for
what
has
happened
you
were
not
he
had
arranged
it
all
you
were
only
the
tool
just
as
i
was
you
must
understand
and
believe
that
percy
would
hate
to
think
that
you
felt
yourself
to
blame
you
are
not
that
in
any
way
the
challenge
was
bound
to
come
chauvelin
had
arranged
that
it
should
come
and
if
you
had
failed
him
as
a
tool
he
soon
would
have
found
another
do
you
believe
that
i
believe
that
you
are
an
angel
of
goodness
lady
blakeney
replied
juliette
struggling
with
her
tears
and
that
you
are
the
only
woman
in
the
world
worthy
to
be
his
wife
but
insisted
marguerite
firmly
as
the
young
girl
took
her
cold
hand
in
her
own
and
gently
fondling
it
covered
it
with
grateful
kisses
but
if
if
anything
happens
anon
you
will
believe
firmly
that
you
were
in
no
way
responsible
that
you
were
innocent
and
merely
a
blind
tool
god
bless
you
for
that
you
will
believe
it
i
will
and
now
for
my
request
rejoined
lady
blakeney
in
a
more
quiet
more
matter
-
of
-
fact
tone
of
voice
you
must
represent
me
here
when
i
am
gone
explain
as
casually
and
as
naturally
as
you
can
that
i
have
gone
to
join
my
husband
on
his
yacht
for
a
few
days
lucie
my
maid
is
devoted
and
a
tower
of
secrecy
she
will
stand
between
you
and
the
rest
of
the
household
in
concocting
some
plausible
story
to
every
friend
who
calls
to
anyone
of
our
world
whom
you
may
meet
you
must
tell
the
same
tale
and
if
you
note
an
air
of
incredulity
in
anyone
if
you
hear
whispers
of
there
being
some
mystery
well
let
the
world
wag
its
busy
tongue
i
care
less
than
naught
it
will
soon
tire
of
me
and
my
doings
and
having
torn
my
reputation
to
shreds
will
quickly
leave
me
in
peace
but
to
sir
andrew
ffoulkes
she
added
earnestly
tell
the
whole
truth
from
me
he
will
understand
and
do
as
he
thinks
right
i
will
do
all
you
ask
lady
blakeney
and
am
proud
to
think
that
i
shall
be
serving
you
even
in
so
humble
and
easy
a
capacity
when
do
you
start
at
once
good
-
bye
juliette
she
bent
down
to
the
young
girl
and
kissed
her
tenderly
on
the
forehead
then
she
glided
out
of
the
room
as
rapidly
as
she
had
come
juliette
of
course
did
not
try
to
detain
her
or
to
force
her
help
of
companionship
on
her
when
obviously
she
would
wish
to
be
alone
marguerite
quickly
reached
her
room
her
maid
lucie
was
already
waiting
for
her
devoted
and
silent
as
she
was
one
glance
at
her
mistress
'
face
told
her
that
trouble
grave
and
imminent
had
reached
blakeney
manor
marguerite
whilst
lucie
undressed
her
took
up
the
passport
and
carefully
perused
the
personal
description
of
one
celine
dumont
maid
to
citizeness
desiree
candeille
which
was
given
therein
tall
blue
eyes
light
hair
age
about
twenty
-
five
it
all
might
have
been
vaguely
meant
for
her
she
had
a
dark
cloth
gown
and
long
black
cloak
with
hood
to
come
well
over
the
head
these
she
now
donned
with
some
thick
shoes
and
a
dark
-
coloured
handkerchief
tied
over
her
head
under
the
hood
so
as
to
hide
the
golden
glory
of
her
hair
she
was
quite
calm
and
in
no
haste
she
made
lucie
pack
a
small
hand
valise
with
some
necessaries
for
the
journey
and
provided
herself
plentifully
with
money
french
and
english
notes
which
she
tucked
well
away
inside
her
dress
then
she
bade
her
maid
who
was
struggling
with
her
tears
a
kindly
farewell
and
quickly
went
down
to
her
coach
during
the
journey
marguerite
had
not
much
leisure
to
think
the
discomforts
and
petty
miseries
incidental
on
cheap
travelling
had
the
very
welcome
effect
of
making
her
forget
for
the
time
being
the
soul
-
rendering
crisis
through
which
she
was
now
passing
for
of
necessity
she
had
to
travel
at
the
cheap
rate
among
the
crowd
of
poorer
passengers
who
were
herded
aft
the
packet
boat
leaning
up
against
one
another
sitting
on
bundles
and
packages
of
all
kinds
that
part
of
the
deck
reeking
with
the
smell
of
tar
and
sea
-
water
damp
squally
and
stuffy
was
an
abomination
of
hideous
discomfort
to
the
dainty
fastidious
lady
of
fashion
yet
she
almost
welcomed
the
intolerable
propinquity
the
cold
douches
of
salt
water
which
every
now
and
then
wetted
her
through
and
through
for
it
was
the
consequent
sense
of
physical
wretchedness
that
helped
her
to
forget
the
intolerable
anguish
of
her
mind
and
among
these
poorer
travellers
she
felt
secure
from
observation
no
one
took
much
notice
of
her
she
looked
just
like
one
of
the
herd
and
in
the
huddled
-
up
little
figure
in
the
dark
bedraggled
clothes
no
one
would
for
a
moment
have
recognized
the
dazzling
personality
of
lady
blakeney
drawing
her
hood
well
over
her
head
she
sat
in
a
secluded
corner
of
the
deck
upon
the
little
black
valise
which
contained
the
few
belongings
she
had
brought
with
her
her
cloak
and
dress
now
mud
-
stained
and
dank
with
splashings
of
salt
-
water
attracted
no
one
'
s
attention
there
was
a
keen
northeasterly
breeze
cold
and
penetrating
but
favourable
to
a
rapid
crossing
marguerite
who
had
gone
through
several
hours
of
weary
travelling
by
coach
before
she
had
embarked
at
dover
in
the
late
afternoon
was
unspeakably
tired
she
had
watched
the
golden
sunset
out
at
sea
until
her
eyes
were
burning
with
pain
and
as
the
dazzling
crimson
and
orange
and
purple
gave
place
to
the
soft
grey
tones
of
evening
she
descried
the
round
cupola
of
the
church
of
our
lady
of
boulogne
against
the
dull
background
of
the
sky
after
that
her
mind
became
a
blank
a
sort
of
torpor
fell
over
her
sense
she
was
wakeful
and
yet
half
-
asleep
unconscious
of
everything
around
her
seeing
nothing
but
the
distant
massive
towers
of
old
boulogne
churches
gradually
detaching
themselves
one
by
one
from
out
the
fast
gathering
gloom
the
town
seemed
like
a
dream
city
a
creation
of
some
morbid
imagination
presented
to
her
mind
'
s
eye
as
the
city
of
sorrow
and
death
when
the
boat
finally
scraped
her
sides
along
the
rough
wooden
jetty
marguerite
felt
as
if
she
were
forcibly
awakened
she
was
numb
and
stiff
and
thought
she
must
have
fallen
asleep
during
the
last
half
hour
of
the
journey
everything
round
her
was
dark
the
sky
was
overcast
and
the
night
seemed
unusually
sombre
figures
were
moving
all
around
her
there
was
noise
and
confusion
of
voices
and
a
general
pushing
and
shouting
which
seemed
strangely
weird
in
this
gloom
here
among
the
poorer
passengers
there
had
not
been
thought
any
necessity
for
a
light
one
solitary
lantern
fixed
to
a
mast
only
enhanced
the
intense
blackness
of
everything
around
now
and
then
a
face
would
come
within
range
of
this
meagre
streak
of
yellow
light
looking
strangely
distorted
with
great
elongated
shadows
across
the
brow
and
chin
a
grotesque
ghostly
apparition
which
quickly
vanished
again
scurrying
off
like
some
frightened
gnome
giving
place
other
forms
other
figures
all
equally
grotesque
and
equally
weird
marguerite
watched
them
all
half
stupidly
and
motionlessly
for
awhile
she
did
not
quite
know
what
she
ought
to
do
and
did
not
like
to
ask
any
questions
she
was
dazed
and
the
darkness
blinded
her
then
gradually
things
began
to
detach
themselves
more
clearly
on
looking
straight
before
her
she
began
to
discern
the
landing
place
the
little
wooden
bridge
across
which
the
passengers
walked
one
by
one
from
the
boat
unto
the
jetty
the
first
-
class
passengers
were
evidently
all
alighting
now
the
crowd
of
which
marguerite
formed
a
unit
had
been
pushed
back
in
a
more
compact
herd
out
of
the
way
for
the
moment
so
that
their
betters
might
get
along
more
comfortably
beyond
the
landing
stage
a
little
booth
had
been
erected
a
kind
of
tent
open
in
front
and
lighted
up
within
by
a
couple
of
lanthorns
under
this
tent
there
was
a
table
behind
which
sat
a
man
dressed
in
some
sort
of
official
looking
clothes
and
wearing
the
tricolour
scarf
across
his
chest
all
the
passengers
from
the
boat
had
apparently
to
file
past
this
tent
marguerite
could
see
them
now
quite
distinctly
the
profiles
of
the
various
faces
as
they
paused
for
a
moment
in
front
of
the
table
being
brilliantly
illuminated
by
one
of
the
lanterns
two
sentinels
wearing
the
uniform
of
the
national
guard
stood
each
side
of
the
table
the
passengers
one
by
one
took
out
their
passport
as
they
went
by
handed
it
to
the
man
in
the
official
dress
who
examined
it
carefully
very
lengthily
then
signed
it
and
returned
the
paper
to
its
owner
but
at
times
he
appeared
doubtful
folded
the
passport
and
put
it
down
in
front
of
him
the
passenger
would
protest
marguerite
could
not
hear
what
was
said
but
she
could
see
that
some
argument
was
attempted
quickly
dismissed
by
a
peremptory
order
from
the
official
the
doubtful
passport
was
obviously
put
on
one
side
for
further
examination
and
the
unfortunate
owner
thereof
detained
until
he
or
she
had
been
able
to
give
more
satisfactory
references
to
the
representatives
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
stationed
at
boulogne
this
process
of
examination
necessarily
took
a
long
time
marguerite
was
getting
horribly
tired
her
feet
ached
and
she
scarcely
could
hold
herself
upright
yet
she
watched
all
these
people
mechanically
making
absurd
little
guesses
in
her
weary
mind
as
to
whose
passport
would
find
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
official
and
whose
would
be
found
suspect
and
inadequate
suspect
a
terrible
word
these
times
since
merlin
'
s
terrible
law
decreed
now
that
every
man
woman
or
child
who
was
suspected
by
the
republic
of
being
a
traitor
was
a
traitor
in
fact
how
sorry
she
felt
for
those
whose
passports
were
detained
who
tried
to
argue
so
needlessly
and
who
were
finally
led
off
by
a
soldier
who
had
stepped
out
from
somewhere
in
the
dark
and
had
to
await
further
examination
probably
imprisonment
and
often
death
as
to
herself
she
felt
quite
safe
the
passport
given
to
her
by
chauvelin
'
s
own
accomplice
was
sure
to
be
quite
en
regle
then
suddenly
her
heart
seemed
to
give
a
sudden
leap
and
then
to
stop
in
its
beating
for
a
second
or
two
in
one
of
the
passengers
a
man
who
was
just
passing
in
front
of
the
tent
she
had
recognized
the
form
and
profile
of
chauvelin
he
had
no
passport
to
show
but
evidently
the
official
knew
who
he
was
for
he
stood
up
and
saluted
and
listened
deferentially
whilst
the
ex
-
ambassador
apparently
gave
him
a
few
instructions
it
seemed
to
marguerite
that
these
instructions
related
to
two
women
who
were
close
behind
chauvelin
at
the
time
and
who
presently
seemed
to
file
past
without
going
through
the
usual
formalities
of
showing
their
passports
but
of
this
she
could
not
be
quite
sure
the
women
were
closely
hooded
and
veiled
and
her
own
attention
had
been
completely
absorbed
by
this
sudden
appearance
of
her
deadly
enemy
yet
what
more
natural
than
that
chauvelin
should
be
here
now
his
object
accomplished
he
had
no
doubt
posted
to
dover
just
as
she
had
done
there
was
no
difficulty
in
that
and
a
man
of
his
type
and
importance
would
always
have
unlimited
means
and
money
at
his
command
to
accomplish
any
journey
he
might
desire
to
undertake
there
was
nothing
strange
or
even
unexpected
in
the
man
'
s
presence
here
and
yet
somehow
it
had
made
the
whole
awful
reality
more
tangible
more
wholly
unforgettable
marguerite
remembered
his
abject
words
to
her
when
first
she
had
seen
him
at
the
richmond
fete
he
said
that
he
had
fallen
into
disgrace
that
having
failed
in
his
service
to
the
republic
he
had
been
relegated
to
a
subordinate
position
pushed
aside
with
contumely
to
make
room
for
better
abler
men
well
all
that
was
a
lie
of
course
a
cunning
method
of
gaining
access
into
her
house
of
that
she
had
already
been
convinced
when
candeille
provoked
the
esclandre
which
led
to
the
challenge
that
on
french
soil
he
seemed
in
anything
but
a
subsidiary
position
that
he
appeared
to
rule
rather
than
to
obey
could
in
no
way
appear
to
marguerite
in
the
nature
of
surprise
as
the
actress
had
been
a
willing
tool
in
the
cunning
hands
of
chauvelin
so
were
probably
all
these
people
around
her
where
others
cringed
in
the
face
of
officialism
the
ex
-
ambassador
had
stepped
forth
as
a
master
he
had
shown
a
badge
spoken
a
word
mayhap
and
the
man
in
the
tent
who
had
made
other
people
tremble
stood
up
deferentially
and
obeyed
all
commands
it
was
all
very
simple
and
very
obvious
but
marguerite
'
s
mind
has
been
asleep
and
it
was
the
sight
of
the
sable
-
clad
little
figure
which
had
roused
it
from
its
happy
torpor
in
a
moment
now
her
brain
was
active
and
alert
and
presently
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
another
figure
taller
than
those
around
had
crossed
the
barrier
immediately
in
the
wake
of
chauvelin
then
she
chided
herself
for
her
fancies
it
could
not
be
her
husband
not
yet
he
had
gone
by
water
and
would
scarce
be
in
boulogne
before
the
morning
ah
now
at
last
came
the
turn
of
the
second
-
class
passengers
there
was
a
general
bousculade
and
the
human
bundle
began
to
move
marguerite
lost
sight
of
the
tent
and
its
awe
-
inspiring
appurtenances
she
was
a
mere
unit
again
in
this
herd
on
the
move
she
too
progressed
along
slowly
one
step
at
a
time
it
was
wearisome
and
she
was
deadly
tired
she
was
beginning
to
form
plans
now
that
she
had
arrived
in
france
all
along
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
begin
by
seeking
out
the
abbe
foucquet
for
he
would
prove
a
link
'
twixt
her
husband
and
herself
she
knew
that
percy
would
communicate
with
the
abbe
had
he
not
told
her
that
the
rescue
of
the
devoted
old
man
from
the
clutches
of
the
terrorists
would
be
one
of
the
chief
objects
of
his
journey
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
what
she
would
do
if
she
found
the
abbe
foucquet
gone
from
boulogne
he
la
mere
your
passport
the
rough
words
roused
her
from
her
meditations
she
had
moved
forward
quite
mechanically
her
mind
elsewhere
her
thoughts
not
following
the
aim
of
her
feet
thus
she
must
have
crossed
the
bridge
along
with
some
of
the
crowd
must
have
landed
on
the
jetty
and
reached
the
front
of
the
tent
without
really
knowing
what
she
was
doing
ah
yes
her
passport
she
had
quite
forgotten
that
but
she
had
it
by
her
quite
in
order
given
to
her
in
a
fit
of
tardy
remorse
by
demoiselle
candeille
the
intimate
friend
of
one
of
the
most
influential
members
of
the
revolutionary
government
of
france
she
took
the
passport
from
the
bosom
of
her
dress
and
handed
it
to
the
man
in
the
official
dress
your
name
he
asked
peremptorily
celine
dumont
she
replied
unhesitatingly
for
had
she
not
rehearsed
all
this
in
her
mind
dozens
of
times
until
her
tongue
could
rattle
off
the
borrowed
name
as
easily
as
it
could
her
own
servitor
to
citizeness
desiree
candeille
the
man
who
had
very
carefully
been
examining
the
paper
the
while
placed
it
down
on
the
table
deliberately
in
front
of
him
and
said
celine
dumont
eh
la
mere
what
tricks
are
you
up
to
now
tricks
i
do
not
understand
she
said
quietly
for
she
was
not
afraid
the
passport
was
en
regle
she
knew
she
had
nothing
to
fear
oh
but
i
think
you
do
retorted
the
official
with
a
sneer
and
'
tis
a
mighty
clever
one
i
will
allow
celine
dumont
ma
foi
not
badly
imagined
ma
petite
mere
and
all
would
have
passed
off
splendidly
unfortunately
celine
dumont
servitor
to
citizeness
desiree
candeille
passed
through
these
barriers
along
with
her
mistress
not
half
an
hour
ago
and
with
long
grimy
finger
he
pointed
to
an
entry
in
the
large
book
which
lay
open
before
him
and
wherein
he
had
apparently
been
busy
making
notes
of
the
various
passengers
who
had
filed
past
him
then
he
looked
up
with
a
triumphant
leer
at
the
calm
face
of
marguerite
she
still
did
not
feel
really
frightened
only
puzzled
and
perturbed
but
all
the
blood
had
rushed
away
from
her
face
leaving
her
cheeks
ashen
white
and
pressing
against
her
heart
until
it
almost
choked
her
you
are
making
a
mistake
citizen
she
said
very
quietly
i
am
citizeness
candeille
'
s
maid
she
gave
me
the
passport
herself
just
before
i
left
for
england
if
you
will
ask
her
the
question
she
will
confirm
what
i
say
and
she
assured
me
that
it
was
quite
en
regle
but
the
man
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
laughed
derisively
the
incident
evidently
amused
him
yet
he
must
have
seen
many
of
the
same
sort
in
the
far
corner
of
the
tent
marguerite
seemed
to
discern
a
few
moving
forms
soldiers
she
thought
for
she
caught
sight
of
a
glint
like
that
of
steel
one
or
two
men
stood
close
behind
the
official
at
the
desk
and
the
sentinels
were
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
tent
with
an
instinctive
sense
of
appeal
marguerite
looked
round
from
one
face
to
the
other
but
each
looked
absolutely
impassive
and
stolid
quite
uninterested
in
this
little
scene
the
exact
counterpart
of
a
dozen
others
enacted
on
this
very
spot
within
the
last
hour
he
la
la
petite
mere
said
the
official
in
the
same
tone
of
easy
persiflage
which
he
had
adopted
all
along
but
we
do
know
how
to
concoct
a
pretty
lie
aye
and
so
circumstantially
too
unfortunately
it
was
citizeness
desiree
candeille
herself
who
happened
to
be
standing
just
where
you
are
at
the
present
moment
along
with
her
maid
celine
dumont
both
of
whom
were
specially
signed
for
and
recommended
as
perfectly
trustworthy
by
no
less
a
person
than
citoyen
chauvelin
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
but
i
assure
you
that
there
is
a
mistake
pleased
marguerite
earnestly
'
tis
the
other
woman
who
lied
i
have
my
passport
and
a
truce
on
this
retorted
the
man
peremptorily
if
everything
is
as
you
say
and
if
you
have
nothing
to
hide
you
will
be
at
liberty
to
continue
your
journey
to
-
morrow
after
you
have
explained
yourself
before
the
citizen
governor
next
one
now
quick
marguerite
tried
another
protest
just
as
those
others
had
done
whom
she
had
watched
so
mechanically
before
but
already
she
knew
that
that
would
be
useless
for
she
had
felt
that
a
heavy
hand
was
being
placed
on
her
shoulder
and
that
she
was
being
roughly
led
away
in
a
flash
she
had
understood
and
seen
the
whole
sequel
of
the
awful
trap
which
had
all
along
been
destined
to
engulf
her
as
well
as
her
husband
what
a
clumsy
blind
fool
she
had
been
what
a
miserable
antagonist
the
subtle
schemes
of
a
past
master
of
intrigue
as
was
chauvelin
to
have
enticed
the
scarlet
pimpernel
to
france
was
a
great
thing
the
challenge
was
clever
the
acceptance
of
it
by
the
bold
adventurer
a
forgone
conclusion
but
the
master
stroke
of
the
whole
plan
was
done
when
she
the
wife
was
enticed
over
too
with
the
story
of
candeille
'
s
remorse
and
the
offer
of
the
passport
fool
fool
that
she
was
and
how
well
did
chauvelin
know
feminine
nature
how
cleverly
he
had
divined
her
thoughts
her
feelings
the
impulsive
way
in
which
she
would
act
how
easily
he
had
guessed
that
knowing
her
husband
'
s
danger
she
marguerite
would
immediately
follow
him
now
the
trap
had
closed
on
her
and
she
saw
it
all
when
it
was
too
late
percy
blakeney
in
france
his
wife
a
prisoner
her
freedom
and
safety
in
exchange
for
his
life
the
hopelessness
of
it
all
struck
her
with
appalling
force
and
her
sense
reeled
with
the
awful
finality
of
the
disaster
yet
instinct
in
her
still
struggled
for
freedom
ahead
of
her
and
all
around
beyond
the
tent
and
in
the
far
distance
there
was
a
provocative
alluring
darkness
if
she
only
could
get
away
only
could
reach
the
shelter
of
that
remote
and
sombre
distance
she
would
hide
and
wait
not
blunder
again
oh
no
she
would
be
prudent
and
wary
if
only
she
could
get
away
one
woman
'
s
struggles
against
five
men
it
was
pitiable
sublime
absolutely
useless
the
man
in
the
tent
seemed
to
be
watching
her
with
much
amusement
for
a
moment
or
two
as
her
whole
graceful
body
stiffened
for
that
absurd
and
unequal
physical
contest
he
seemed
vastly
entertained
at
the
sight
of
this
good
-
looking
young
woman
striving
to
pit
her
strength
against
five
sturdy
soldiers
of
the
republic
allons
that
will
do
now
he
said
at
last
roughly
we
have
no
time
to
waste
get
the
jade
away
and
let
her
cool
her
temper
in
no
6
until
the
citizen
governor
gives
further
orders
take
her
away
he
shouted
more
loudly
banging
a
grimy
fist
down
on
the
table
before
him
as
marguerite
still
struggled
on
with
the
blind
madness
of
despair
pardi
can
none
of
you
rid
us
of
that
turbulent
baggage
the
crowd
behind
were
pushing
forward
the
guard
within
the
tent
were
jeering
at
those
who
were
striving
to
drag
marguerite
away
these
latter
were
cursing
loudly
and
volubly
until
one
of
them
tired
out
furious
and
brutal
raised
his
heavy
fist
and
with
an
obscene
oath
brought
it
crashing
down
upon
the
unfortunate
woman
'
s
head
perhaps
though
it
was
the
work
of
a
savage
and
cruel
creature
the
blow
proved
more
merciful
than
it
had
been
intended
it
had
caught
marguerite
full
between
the
eyes
her
aching
senses
wearied
and
reeling
already
gave
way
beneath
this
terrible
violence
her
useless
struggles
ceased
her
arms
fell
inert
by
her
side
and
losing
consciousness
completely
her
proud
unbendable
spirit
was
spared
the
humiliating
knowledge
of
her
final
removal
by
the
rough
soldiers
and
of
the
complete
wreckage
of
her
last
lingering
hopes
consciousness
returned
very
slowly
very
painfully
it
was
night
when
last
marguerite
had
clearly
known
what
was
going
on
around
her
it
was
daylight
before
she
realized
that
she
still
lived
that
she
still
knew
and
