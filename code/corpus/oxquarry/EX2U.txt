a
large
map
of
london
would
be
needed
to
display
the
wild
and
zigzag
course
of
one
day
'
s
journey
undertaken
by
an
uncle
and
his
nephew
or
to
speak
more
truly
of
a
nephew
and
his
uncle
for
the
nephew
a
schoolboy
on
a
holiday
was
in
theory
the
god
in
the
car
or
in
the
cab
tram
tube
and
so
on
while
his
uncle
was
at
most
a
priest
dancing
before
him
and
offering
sacrifices
to
put
it
more
soberly
the
schoolboy
had
something
of
the
stolid
air
of
a
young
duke
doing
the
grand
tour
while
his
elderly
relative
was
reduced
to
the
position
of
a
courier
who
nevertheless
had
to
pay
for
everything
like
a
patron
the
schoolboy
was
officially
known
as
summers
minor
and
in
a
more
social
manner
as
stinks
the
only
public
tribute
to
his
career
as
an
amateur
photographer
and
electrician
the
uncle
was
the
rev
thomas
twyford
a
lean
and
lively
old
gentleman
with
a
red
eager
face
and
white
hair
he
was
in
the
ordinary
way
a
country
clergyman
but
he
was
one
of
those
who
achieve
the
paradox
of
being
famous
in
an
obscure
way
because
they
are
famous
in
an
obscure
world
in
a
small
circle
of
ecclesiastical
archaeologists
who
were
the
only
people
who
could
even
understand
one
another
'
s
discoveries
he
occupied
a
recognized
and
respectable
place
and
a
critic
might
have
found
even
in
that
day
'
s
journey
at
least
as
much
of
the
uncle
'
s
hobby
as
of
the
nephew
'
s
holiday
his
original
purpose
had
been
wholly
paternal
and
festive
but
like
many
other
intelligent
people
he
was
not
above
the
weakness
of
playing
with
a
toy
to
amuse
himself
on
the
theory
that
it
would
amuse
a
child
his
toys
were
crowns
and
miters
and
croziers
and
swords
of
state
and
he
had
lingered
over
them
telling
himself
that
the
boy
ought
to
see
all
the
sights
of
london
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
after
a
tremendous
tea
he
rather
gave
the
game
away
by
winding
up
with
a
visit
in
which
hardly
any
human
boy
could
be
conceived
as
taking
an
interest
an
underground
chamber
supposed
to
have
been
a
chapel
recently
excavated
on
the
north
bank
of
the
thames
and
containing
literally
nothing
whatever
but
one
old
silver
coin
but
the
coin
to
those
who
knew
was
more
solitary
and
splendid
than
the
koh
-
i
-
noor
it
was
roman
and
was
said
to
bear
the
head
of
st
paul
and
round
it
raged
the
most
vital
controversies
about
the
ancient
british
church
it
could
hardly
be
denied
however
that
the
controversies
left
summers
minor
comparatively
cold
indeed
the
things
that
interested
summers
minor
and
the
things
that
did
not
interest
him
had
mystified
and
amused
his
uncle
for
several
hours
he
exhibited
the
english
schoolboy
'
s
startling
ignorance
and
startling
knowledge
knowledge
of
some
special
classification
in
which
he
can
generally
correct
and
confound
his
elders
he
considered
himself
entitled
at
hampton
court
on
a
holiday
to
forget
the
very
names
of
cardinal
wolsey
or
william
of
orange
but
he
could
hardly
be
dragged
from
some
details
about
the
arrangement
of
the
electric
bells
in
the
neighboring
hotel
he
was
solidly
dazed
by
westminster
abbey
which
is
not
so
unnatural
since
that
church
became
the
lumber
room
of
the
larger
and
less
successful
statuary
of
the
eighteenth
century
but
he
had
a
magic
and
minute
knowledge
of
the
westminster
omnibuses
and
indeed
of
the
whole
omnibus
system
of
london
the
colors
and
numbers
of
which
he
knew
as
a
herald
knows
heraldry
he
would
cry
out
against
a
momentary
confusion
between
a
light
-
green
paddington
and
a
dark
-
green
bayswater
vehicle
as
his
uncle
would
at
the
identification
of
a
greek
ikon
and
a
roman
image
do
you
collect
omnibuses
like
stamps
asked
his
uncle
they
must
need
a
rather
large
album
or
do
you
keep
them
in
your
locker
i
keep
them
in
my
head
replied
the
nephew
with
legitimate
firmness
it
does
you
credit
i
admit
replied
the
clergyman
i
suppose
it
were
vain
to
ask
for
what
purpose
you
have
learned
that
out
of
a
thousand
things
there
hardly
seems
to
be
a
career
in
it
unless
you
could
be
permanently
on
the
pavement
to
prevent
old
ladies
getting
into
the
wrong
bus
well
we
must
get
out
of
this
one
for
this
is
our
place
i
want
to
show
you
what
they
call
st
paul
'
s
penny
is
it
like
st
paul
'
s
cathedral
asked
the
youth
with
resignation
as
they
alighted
at
the
entrance
their
eyes
were
arrested
by
a
singular
figure
evidently
hovering
there
with
a
similar
anxiety
to
enter
it
was
that
of
a
dark
thin
man
in
a
long
black
robe
rather
like
a
cassock
but
the
black
cap
on
his
head
was
of
too
strange
a
shape
to
be
a
biretta
it
suggested
rather
some
archaic
headdress
of
persia
or
babylon
he
had
a
curious
black
beard
appearing
only
at
the
corners
of
his
chin
and
his
large
eyes
were
oddly
set
in
his
face
like
the
flat
decorative
eyes
painted
in
old
egyptian
profiles
before
they
had
gathered
more
than
a
general
impression
of
him
he
had
dived
into
the
doorway
that
was
their
own
destination
nothing
could
be
seen
above
ground
of
the
sunken
sanctuary
except
a
strong
wooden
hut
of
the
sort
recently
run
up
for
many
military
and
official
purposes
the
wooden
floor
of
which
was
indeed
a
mere
platform
over
the
excavated
cavity
below
a
soldier
stood
as
a
sentry
outside
and
a
superior
soldier
an
anglo
-
indian
officer
of
distinction
sat
writing
at
the
desk
inside
indeed
the
sightseers
soon
found
that
this
particular
sight
was
surrounded
with
the
most
extraordinary
precautions
i
have
compared
the
silver
coin
to
the
koh
-
i
-
noor
and
in
one
sense
it
was
even
conventionally
comparable
since
by
a
historical
accident
it
was
at
one
time
almost
counted
among
the
crown
jewels
or
at
least
the
crown
relics
until
one
of
the
royal
princes
publicly
restored
it
to
the
shrine
to
which
it
was
supposed
to
belong
other
causes
combined
to
concentrate
official
vigilance
upon
it
there
had
been
a
scare
about
spies
carrying
explosives
in
small
objects
and
one
of
those
experimental
orders
which
pass
like
waves
over
bureaucracy
had
decreed
first
that
all
visitors
should
change
their
clothes
for
a
sort
of
official
sackcloth
and
then
(
when
this
method
caused
some
murmurs
)
that
they
should
at
least
turn
out
their
pockets
colonel
morris
the
officer
in
charge
was
a
short
active
man
with
a
grim
and
leathery
face
but
a
lively
and
humorous
eye
a
contradiction
borne
out
by
his
conduct
for
he
at
once
derided
the
safeguards
and
yet
insisted
on
them
i
do
not
care
a
button
myself
for
paul
'
s
penny
or
such
things
he
admitted
in
answer
to
some
antiquarian
openings
from
the
clergyman
who
was
slightly
acquainted
with
him
but
i
wear
the
king
'
s
coat
you
know
and
it
is
a
serious
thing
when
the
king
'
s
uncle
leaves
a
thing
here
with
his
own
hands
under
my
charge
but
as
for
saints
and
relics
and
things
i
fear
i
am
a
bit
of
a
voltairian
what
you
would
call
a
skeptic
i
am
not
sure
it
is
even
skeptical
to
believe
in
the
royal
family
and
not
in
the
'
holy
'
family
replied
mr
twyford
but
of
course
i
can
easily
empty
my
pockets
to
show
i
do
not
carry
a
bomb
the
little
heap
of
the
parson
'
s
possessions
which
he
left
on
the
table
consisted
chiefly
of
papers
over
and
above
a
pipe
and
a
tobacco
pouch
and
some
roman
and
saxon
coins
the
rest
were
catalogues
of
old
books
and
pamphlets
like
one
entitled
the
use
of
sarum
one
glance
at
which
was
sufficient
both
for
the
colonel
and
the
schoolboy
they
could
not
see
the
use
of
sarum
at
all
the
contents
of
the
boy
'
s
pockets
naturally
made
a
larger
heap
and
included
marbles
a
ball
of
string
an
electric
torch
a
magnet
a
small
catapult
and
of
course
a
large
pocketknife
almost
to
be
described
as
a
small
tool
box
a
complex
apparatus
on
which
he
seemed
disposed
to
linger
pointing
out
that
it
included
a
pair
of
nippers
a
tool
for
punching
holes
in
wood
and
above
all
an
instrument
for
taking
stones
out
of
a
horse
'
s
hoof
the
comparative
absence
of
any
horse
he
appeared
to
regard
as
irrelevant
as
if
it
were
a
mere
appendage
easily
supplied
but
when
the
turn
came
of
the
gentleman
in
the
black
gown
he
did
not
turn
out
his
pockets
but
merely
spread
out
his
hands
i
have
no
possessions
he
said
i
am
afraid
i
must
ask
you
to
empty
your
pockets
and
make
sure
observed
the
colonel
gruffly
i
have
no
pockets
said
the
stranger
mr
twyford
was
looking
at
the
long
black
gown
with
a
learned
eye
are
you
a
monk
he
asked
in
a
puzzled
fashion
i
am
a
magus
replied
the
stranger
you
have
heard
of
the
magi
perhaps
i
am
a
magician
oh
i
say
exclaimed
summers
minor
with
prominent
eyes
but
i
was
once
a
monk
went
on
the
other
i
am
what
you
would
call
an
escaped
monk
yes
i
have
escaped
into
eternity
but
the
monks
held
one
truth
at
least
that
the
highest
life
should
be
without
possessions
i
have
no
pocket
money
and
no
pockets
and
all
the
stars
are
my
trinkets
they
are
out
of
reach
anyhow
observed
colonel
morris
in
a
tone
which
suggested
that
it
was
well
for
them
i
'
ve
known
a
good
many
magicians
myself
in
india
mango
plant
and
all
but
the
indian
ones
are
all
frauds
i
will
swear
in
fact
i
had
a
good
deal
of
fun
showing
them
up
more
fun
than
i
have
over
this
dreary
job
anyhow
but
here
comes
mr
symon
who
will
show
you
over
the
old
cellar
downstairs
mr
symon
the
official
guardian
and
guide
was
a
young
man
prematurely
gray
with
a
grave
mouth
which
contrasted
curiously
with
a
very
small
dark
mustache
with
waxed
points
that
seemed
somehow
separate
from
it
as
if
a
black
fly
had
settled
on
his
face
he
spoke
with
the
accent
of
oxford
and
the
permanent
official
but
in
as
dead
a
fashion
as
the
most
indifferent
hired
guide
they
descended
a
dark
stone
staircase
at
the
floor
of
which
symon
pressed
a
button
and
a
door
opened
on
a
dark
room
or
rather
a
room
which
had
an
instant
before
been
dark
for
almost
as
the
heavy
iron
door
swung
open
an
almost
blinding
blaze
of
electric
lights
filled
the
whole
interior
the
fitful
enthusiasm
of
stinks
at
once
caught
fire
and
he
eagerly
asked
if
the
lights
and
the
door
worked
together
yes
it
is
all
one
system
replied
symon
it
was
all
fitted
up
for
the
day
his
royal
highness
deposited
the
thing
here
you
see
it
is
locked
up
behind
a
glass
case
exactly
as
he
left
it
a
glance
showed
that
the
arrangements
for
guarding
the
treasure
were
indeed
as
strong
as
they
were
simple
a
single
pane
of
glass
cut
off
one
corner
of
the
room
in
an
iron
framework
let
into
the
rock
walls
and
the
wooden
roof
above
there
was
now
no
possibility
of
reopening
the
case
without
elaborate
labor
except
by
breaking
the
glass
which
would
probably
arouse
the
night
watchman
who
was
always
within
a
few
feet
of
it
even
if
he
had
fallen
asleep
a
close
examination
would
have
showed
many
more
ingenious
safeguards
but
the
eye
of
the
rev
thomas
twyford
at
least
was
already
riveted
on
what
interested
him
much
more
the
dull
silver
disk
which
shone
in
the
white
light
against
a
plain
background
of
black
velvet
st
paul
'
s
penny
said
to
commemorate
the
visit
of
st
paul
to
britain
was
probably
preserved
in
this
chapel
until
the
eighth
century
symon
was
saying
in
his
clear
but
colorless
voice
in
the
ninth
century
it
is
supposed
to
have
been
carried
away
by
the
barbarians
and
it
reappears
after
the
conversion
of
the
northern
goths
in
the
possession
of
the
royal
family
of
gothland
his
royal
highness
the
duke
of
gothland
retained
it
always
in
his
own
private
custody
and
when
he
decided
to
exhibit
it
to
the
public
placed
it
here
with
his
own
hand
it
was
immediately
sealed
up
in
such
a
manner
unluckily
at
this
point
summers
minor
whose
attention
had
somewhat
strayed
from
the
religious
wars
of
the
ninth
century
caught
sight
of
a
short
length
of
wire
appearing
in
a
broken
patch
in
the
wall
he
precipitated
himself
at
it
calling
out
i
say
say
does
that
connect
it
was
evident
that
it
did
connect
for
no
sooner
had
the
boy
given
it
a
twitch
than
the
whole
room
went
black
as
if
they
had
all
been
struck
blind
and
an
instant
afterward
they
heard
the
dull
crash
of
the
closing
door
well
you
'
ve
done
it
now
said
symon
in
his
tranquil
fashion
then
after
a
pause
he
added
i
suppose
they
will
miss
us
sooner
or
later
and
no
doubt
they
can
get
it
open
but
it
may
take
some
little
time
there
was
a
silence
and
then
the
unconquerable
stinks
observed
rotten
that
i
had
to
leave
my
electric
torch
i
think
said
his
uncle
with
restraint
that
we
are
sufficiently
convinced
of
your
interest
in
electricity
then
after
a
pause
he
remarked
more
amiably
i
suppose
if
i
regretted
any
of
my
own
impedimenta
it
would
be
the
pipe
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
not
much
fun
smoking
in
the
dark
everything
seems
different
in
the
dark
everything
is
different
in
the
dark
said
a
third
voice
that
of
the
man
who
called
himself
a
magician
it
was
a
very
musical
voice
and
rather
in
contrast
with
his
sinister
and
swarthy
visage
which
was
now
invisible
perhaps
you
do
not
know
how
terrible
a
truth
that
is
all
you
see
are
pictures
made
by
the
sun
faces
and
furniture
and
flowers
and
trees
the
things
themselves
may
be
quite
strange
to
you
something
else
may
be
standing
now
where
you
saw
a
table
or
a
chair
the
face
of
your
friend
may
be
quite
different
in
the
dark
a
short
indescribable
noise
broke
the
stillness
twyford
started
for
a
second
and
then
said
sharply
really
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
suitable
occasion
for
trying
to
frighten
a
child
who
'
s
a
child
cried
the
indignant
summers
with
a
voice
that
had
a
crow
but
also
something
of
a
crack
in
it
and
who
'
s
a
funk
either
not
me
i
will
be
silent
then
said
the
other
voice
out
of
the
darkness
but
silence
also
makes
and
unmakes
the
required
silence
remained
unbroken
for
a
long
time
until
at
last
the
clergyman
said
to
symon
in
a
low
voice
i
suppose
it
is
all
right
about
air
oh
yes
replied
the
other
aloud
there
'
s
a
fireplace
and
a
chimney
in
the
office
just
by
the
door
a
bound
and
the
noise
of
a
falling
chair
told
them
that
the
irrepressible
rising
generation
had
once
more
thrown
itself
across
the
room
they
heard
the
ejaculation
a
chimney
why
i
will
be
and
the
rest
was
lost
in
muffled
but
exultant
cries
the
uncle
called
repeatedly
and
vainly
groped
his
way
at
last
to
the
opening
and
peering
up
it
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
disk
of
daylight
which
seemed
to
suggest
that
the
fugitive
had
vanished
in
safety
making
his
way
back
to
the
group
by
the
glass
case
he
fell
over
the
fallen
chair
and
took
a
moment
to
collect
himself
again
he
had
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
to
symon
when
he
stopped
and
suddenly
found
himself
blinking
in
the
full
shock
of
the
white
light
and
looking
over
the
other
man
'
s
shoulder
he
saw
that
the
door
was
standing
open
so
they
'
ve
got
at
us
at
last
he
observed
to
symon
the
man
in
the
black
robe
was
leaning
against
the
wall
some
yards
away
with
a
smile
carved
on
his
face
here
comes
colonel
morris
went
on
twyford
still
speaking
to
symon
one
of
us
will
have
to
tell
him
how
the
light
went
out
will
you
but
symon
still
said
nothing
he
was
standing
as
still
as
a
statue
and
looking
steadily
at
the
black
velvet
behind
the
glass
screen
he
was
looking
at
the
black
velvet
because
there
was
nothing
else
to
look
at
st
paul
'
s
penny
was
gone
colonel
morris
entered
the
room
with
two
new
visitors
presumably
two
new
sightseers
delayed
by
the
accident
the
foremost
was
a
tall
fair
rather
languid
-
looking
man
with
a
bald
brow
and
a
high
-
bridged
nose
his
companion
was
a
younger
man
with
light
curly
hair
and
frank
and
even
innocent
eyes
symon
scarcely
seemed
to
hear
the
newcomers
it
seemed
almost
as
if
he
had
not
realized
that
the
return
of
the
light
revealed
his
brooding
attitude
then
he
started
in
a
guilty
fashion
and
when
he
saw
the
elder
of
the
two
strangers
his
pale
face
seemed
to
turn
a
shade
paler
why
it
is
horne
fisher
and
then
after
a
pause
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
in
the
devil
of
a
hole
fisher
there
does
seem
a
bit
of
a
mystery
to
be
cleared
up
observed
the
gentleman
so
addressed
it
will
never
be
cleared
up
said
the
pale
symon
if
anybody
could
clear
it
up
you
could
but
nobody
could
i
rather
think
i
could
said
another
voice
from
outside
the
group
and
they
turned
in
surprise
to
realize
that
the
man
in
the
black
robe
had
spoken
again
you
said
the
colonel
sharply
and
how
do
you
propose
to
play
the
detective
i
do
not
propose
to
play
the
detective
answered
the
other
in
a
clear
voice
like
a
bell
i
propose
to
play
the
magician
one
of
the
magicians
you
show
up
in
india
colonel
no
one
spoke
for
a
moment
and
then
horne
fisher
surprised
everybody
by
saying
well
let
'
s
go
upstairs
and
this
gentleman
can
have
a
try
he
stopped
symon
who
had
an
automatic
finger
on
the
button
saying
no
leave
all
the
lights
on
it
is
a
sort
of
safeguard
the
thing
ca
not
be
taken
away
now
said
symon
bitterly
it
can
be
put
back
replied
fisher
twyford
had
already
run
upstairs
for
news
of
his
vanishing
nephew
and
he
received
news
of
him
in
a
way
that
at
once
puzzled
and
reassured
him
on
the
floor
above
lay
one
of
those
large
paper
darts
which
boys
throw
at
each
other
when
the
schoolmaster
is
out
of
the
room
it
had
evidently
been
thrown
in
at
the
window
and
on
being
unfolded
displayed
a
scrawl
of
bad
handwriting
which
ran
dear
uncle
i
am
all
right
meet
you
at
the
hotel
later
on
and
then
the
signature
insensibly
comforted
by
this
the
clergyman
found
his
thoughts
reverting
voluntarily
to
his
favorite
relic
which
came
a
good
second
in
his
sympathies
to
his
favorite
nephew
and
before
he
knew
where
he
was
he
found
himself
encircled
by
the
group
discussing
its
loss
and
more
or
less
carried
away
on
the
current
of
their
excitement
but
an
undercurrent
of
query
continued
to
run
in
his
mind
as
to
what
had
really
happened
to
the
boy
and
what
was
the
boy
'
s
exact
definition
of
being
all
right
meanwhile
horne
fisher
had
considerably
puzzled
everybody
with
his
new
tone
and
attitude
he
had
talked
to
the
colonel
about
the
military
and
mechanical
arrangements
and
displayed
a
remarkable
knowledge
both
of
the
details
of
discipline
and
the
technicalities
of
electricity
he
had
talked
to
the
clergyman
and
shown
an
equally
surprising
knowledge
of
the
religious
and
historical
interests
involved
in
the
relic
he
had
talked
to
the
man
who
called
himself
a
magician
and
not
only
surprised
but
scandalized
the
company
by
an
equally
sympathetic
familiarity
with
the
most
fantastic
forms
of
oriental
occultism
and
psychic
experiment
and
in
this
last
and
least
respectable
line
of
inquiry
he
was
evidently
prepared
to
go
farthest
he
openly
encouraged
the
magician
and
was
plainly
prepared
to
follow
the
wildest
ways
of
investigation
in
which
that
magus
might
lead
him
how
would
you
begin
now
he
inquired
with
an
anxious
politeness
that
reduced
the
colonel
to
a
congestion
of
rage
it
is
all
a
question
of
a
force
of
establishing
communications
for
a
force
replied
that
adept
affably
ignoring
some
military
mutterings
about
the
police
force
it
is
what
you
in
the
west
used
to
call
animal
magnetism
but
it
is
much
more
than
that
i
had
better
not
say
how
much
more
as
to
setting
about
it
the
usual
method
is
to
throw
some
susceptible
person
into
a
trance
which
serves
as
a
sort
of
bridge
or
cord
of
communication
by
which
the
force
beyond
can
give
him
as
it
were
an
electric
shock
and
awaken
his
higher
senses
it
opens
the
sleeping
eye
of
the
mind
i
am
suspectible
said
fisher
either
with
simplicity
or
with
a
baffling
irony
why
not
open
my
mind
'
s
eye
for
me
my
friend
harold
march
here
will
tell
you
i
sometimes
see
things
even
in
the
dark
nobody
sees
anything
except
in
the
dark
said
the
magician
heavy
clouds
of
sunset
were
closing
round
the
wooden
hut
enormous
clouds
of
which
only
the
corners
*
could
be
seen
in
the
little
window
like
purple
horns
and
tails
almost
as
if
some
huge
monsters
were
prowling
round
the
place
but
the
purple
was
already
deepening
to
dark
gray
it
would
soon
be
night
do
not
light
the
lamp
said
the
magus
with
quiet
authority
arresting
a
movement
in
that
direction
i
told
you
before
that
things
happen
only
in
the
dark
how
such
a
topsy
-
turvy
scene
ever
came
to
be
tolerated
in
the
colonel
'
s
office
of
all
places
was
afterward
a
puzzle
in
the
memory
of
many
including
the
colonel
they
recalled
it
like
a
sort
of
nightmare
like
something
they
could
not
control
perhaps
there
was
really
a
magnetism
about
the
mesmerist
perhaps
there
was
even
more
magnetism
about
the
man
mesmerized
anyhow
the
man
was
being
mesmerized
for
horne
fisher
had
collapsed
into
a
chair
with
his
long
limbs
loose
and
sprawling
and
his
eyes
staring
at
vacancy
and
the
other
man
was
mesmerizing
him
making
sweeping
movements
with
his
darkly
draped
arms
as
if
with
black
wings
the
colonel
had
passed
the
point
of
explosion
and
he
dimly
realized
that
eccentric
aristocrats
are
allowed
their
fling
he
comforted
himself
with
the
knowledge
that
he
had
already
sent
for
the
police
who
would
break
up
any
such
masquerade
and
with
lighting
a
cigar
the
red
end
of
which
in
the
gathering
darkness
glowed
with
protest
yes
i
see
pockets
the
man
in
the
trance
was
saying
i
see
many
pockets
but
they
are
all
empty
no
i
see
one
pocket
that
is
not
empty
there
was
a
faint
stir
in
the
stillness
and
the
magician
said
can
you
see
what
is
in
the
pocket
yes
answered
the
other
there
are
two
bright
things
i
think
they
are
two
bits
of
steel
one
of
the
pieces
of
steel
is
bent
or
crooked
have
they
been
used
in
the
removal
of
the
relic
from
downstairs
yes
there
was
another
pause
and
the
inquirer
added
do
you
see
anything
of
the
relic
itself
i
see
something
shining
on
the
floor
like
the
shadow
or
the
ghost
of
it
it
is
over
there
in
the
corner
beyond
the
desk
there
was
a
movement
of
men
turning
and
then
a
sudden
stillness
as
of
their
stiffening
for
over
in
the
corner
on
the
wooden
floor
there
was
really
a
round
spot
of
pale
light
it
was
the
only
spot
of
light
in
the
room
the
cigar
had
gone
out
it
points
the
way
came
the
voice
of
the
oracle
the
spirits
are
pointing
the
way
to
penitence
and
urging
the
thief
to
restitution
i
can
see
nothing
more
his
voice
trailed
off
into
a
silence
that
lasted
solidly
for
many
minutes
like
the
long
silence
below
when
the
theft
had
been
committed
then
it
was
broken
by
the
ring
of
metal
on
the
floor
and
the
sound
of
something
spinning
and
falling
like
a
tossed
halfpenny
light
the
lamp
cried
fisher
in
a
loud
and
even
jovial
voice
leaping
to
his
feet
with
far
less
languor
than
usual
i
must
be
going
now
but
i
should
like
to
see
it
before
i
go
why
i
came
on
purpose
to
see
it
the
lamp
was
lit
and
he
did
see
it
for
st
paul
'
s
penny
was
lying
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
oh
as
for
that
explained
fisher
when
he
was
entertaining
march
and
twyford
at
lunch
about
a
month
later
i
merely
wanted
to
play
with
the
magician
at
his
own
game
i
thought
you
meant
to
catch
him
in
his
own
trap
said
twyford
i
ca
not
make
head
or
tail
of
anything
yet
but
to
my
mind
he
was
always
the
suspect
i
do
not
think
he
was
necessarily
a
thief
in
the
vulgar
sense
the
police
always
seem
to
think
that
silver
is
stolen
for
the
sake
of
silver
but
a
thing
like
that
might
well
be
stolen
out
of
some
religious
mania
a
runaway
monk
turned
mystic
might
well
want
it
for
some
mystical
purpose
no
replied
fisher
the
runaway
monk
is
not
a
thief
at
any
rate
he
is
not
the
thief
and
he
is
not
altogether
a
liar
either
he
said
one
true
thing
at
least
that
night
and
what
was
that
inquired
march
he
said
it
was
all
magnetism
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
done
by
means
of
a
magnet
then
seeing
they
still
looked
puzzled
he
added
it
was
that
toy
magnet
belonging
to
your
nephew
mr
twyford
but
i
do
not
understand
objected
march
if
it
was
done
with
the
schoolboy
'
s
magnet
i
suppose
it
was
done
by
the
schoolboy
well
replied
fisher
reflectively
it
rather
depends
which
schoolboy
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
the
soul
of
a
schoolboy
is
a
curious
thing
fisher
continued
in
a
meditative
manner
it
can
survive
a
great
many
things
besides
climbing
out
of
a
chimney
a
man
can
grow
gray
in
great
campaigns
and
still
have
the
soul
of
a
schoolboy
a
man
can
return
with
a
great
reputation
from
india
and
be
put
in
charge
of
a
great
public
treasure
and
still
have
the
soul
of
a
schoolboy
waiting
to
be
awakened
by
an
accident
and
it
is
ten
times
more
so
when
to
the
schoolboy
you
add
the
skeptic
who
is
generally
a
sort
of
stunted
schoolboy
you
said
just
now
that
things
might
be
done
by
religious
mania
have
you
ever
heard
of
irreligious
mania
i
assure
you
it
exists
very
violently
especially
in
men
who
like
showing
up
magicians
in
india
but
here
the
skeptic
had
the
temptation
of
showing
up
a
much
more
tremendous
sham
nearer
home
a
light
came
into
harold
march
'
s
eyes
as
he
suddenly
saw
as
if
afar
off
the
wider
implication
of
the
suggestion
but
twyford
was
still
wrestling
with
one
problem
at
a
time
do
you
really
mean
he
said
that
colonel
morris
took
the
relic
he
was
the
only
person
who
could
use
the
magnet
replied
fisher
in
fact
your
obliging
nephew
left
him
a
number
of
things
he
could
use
he
had
a
ball
of
string
and
an
instrument
for
making
a
hole
in
the
wooden
floor
i
made
a
little
play
with
that
hole
in
the
floor
in
my
trance
by
the
way
with
the
lights
left
on
below
it
shone
like
a
new
shilling
twyford
suddenly
bounded
on
his
chair
but
in
that
case
he
cried
in
a
new
and
altered
voice
why
then
of
course
you
said
a
piece
of
steel
i
said
there
were
two
pieces
of
steel
said
fisher
the
bent
piece
of
steel
was
the
boy
'
s
magnet
the
other
was
the
relic
in
the
glass
case
but
that
is
silver
answered
the
archaeologist
in
a
voice
now
almost
unrecognizable
oh
replied
fisher
soothingly
i
dare
say
it
was
painted
with
silver
a
little
there
was
a
heavy
silence
and
at
last
harold
march
said
but
where
is
the
real
relic
where
it
has
been
for
five
years
replied
horne
fisher
in
the
possession
of
a
mad
millionaire
named
vandam
in
nebraska
there
was
a
playful
little
photograph
about
him
in
a
society
paper
the
other
day
mentioning
his
delusion
and
saying
he
was
always
being
taken
in
about
relics
harold
march
frowned
at
the
tablecloth
then
after
an
interval
he
said
i
think
i
understand
your
notion
of
how
the
thing
was
actually
done
according
to
that
morris
just
made
a
hole
and
fished
it
up
with
a
magnet
at
the
end
of
a
string
such
a
monkey
trick
looks
like
mere
madness
but
i
suppose
he
was
mad
partly
with
the
boredom
of
watching
over
what
he
felt
was
a
fraud
though
he
could
not
prove
it
then
came
a
chance
to
prove
it
to
himself
at
least
and
he
had
what
he
called
'
fun
'
with
it
yes
i
think
i
see
a
lot
of
details
now
but
it
is
just
the
whole
thing
that
knocks
me
how
did
it
all
come
to
be
like
that
fisher
was
looking
at
him
with
level
lids
and
an
immovable
manner
every
precaution
was
taken
he
said
the
duke
carried
the
relic
on
his
own
person
and
locked
it
up
in
the
case
with
his
own
hands
march
was
silent
but
twyford
stammered
i
do
not
understand
you
you
give
me
the
creeps
why
do
not
you
speak
plainer
if
i
spoke
plainer
you
would
understand
me
less
said
horne
fisher
all
the
same
i
should
try
said
march
still
without
lifting
his
head
oh
very
well
replied
fisher
with
a
sigh
the
plain
truth
is
of
course
that
it
is
a
bad
business
everybody
knows
it
is
a
bad
business
who
knows
anything
about
it
but
it
is
always
happening
and
in
one
way
one
can
hardly
blame
them
they
get
stuck
on
to
a
foreign
princess
that
'
s
as
stiff
as
a
dutch
doll
and
they
have
their
fling
in
this
case
it
was
a
pretty
big
fling
the
face
of
the
rev
thomas
twyford
certainly
suggested
that
he
was
a
little
out
of
his
depth
in
the
seas
of
truth
but
as
the
other
went
on
speaking
vaguely
the
old
gentleman
'
s
features
sharpened
and
set
if
it
were
some
decent
morganatic
affair
i
would
not
say
but
he
must
have
been
a
fool
to
throw
away
thousands
on
a
woman
like
that
at
the
end
it
was
sheer
blackmail
but
it
is
something
that
the
old
ass
did
not
get
it
out
of
the
taxpayers
he
could
only
get
it
out
of
the
yank
and
there
you
are
the
rev
thomas
twyford
had
risen
to
his
feet
well
i
am
glad
my
nephew
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
said
and
if
that
'
s
what
the
world
is
like
i
hope
he
will
never
have
anything
to
do
with
it
i
hope
not
answered
horne
fisher
no
one
knows
so
well
as
i
do
that
one
can
have
far
too
much
to
do
with
it
for
summers
minor
had
indeed
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
it
is
part
of
his
higher
significance
that
he
has
really
nothing
to
do
with
the
story
or
with
any
such
stories
the
boy
went
like
a
bullet
through
the
tangle
of
this
tale
of
crooked
politics
and
crazy
mockery
and
came
out
on
the
other
side
pursuing
his
own
unspoiled
purposes
from
the
top
of
the
chimney
he
climbed
he
had
caught
sight
of
a
new
omnibus
whose
color
and
name
he
had
never
known
as
a
naturalist
might
see
a
new
bird
or
a
botanist
a
new
flower
and
he
had
been
sufficiently
enraptured
in
rushing
after
it
and
riding
away
upon
that
fairy
ship
in
an
oasis
or
green
island
in
the
red
and
yellow
seas
of
sand
that
stretch
beyond
europe
toward
the
sunrise
there
can
be
found
a
rather
fantastic
contrast
which
is
none
the
less
typical
of
such
ai
place
since
international
treaties
have
made
it
an
outpost
of
the
british
occupation
the
site
is
famous
among
archaeologists
for
something
that
is
hardly
a
monument
but
merely
a
hole
in
the
ground
but
it
is
a
round
shaft
like
that
of
a
well
and
probably
a
part
of
some
great
irrigation
works
of
remote
and
disputed
date
perhaps
more
ancient
than
anything
in
that
ancient
land
there
is
a
green
fringe
of
palm
and
prickly
pear
round
the
black
mouth
of
the
well
but
nothing
of
the
upper
masonry
remains
except
two
bulky
and
battered
stones
standing
like
the
pillars
of
a
gateway
of
nowhere
in
which
some
of
the
more
transcendental
archaeologists
in
certain
moods
at
moonrise
or
sunset
think
they
can
trace
the
faint
lines
of
figures
or
features
of
more
than
babylonian
monstrosity
while
the
more
rationalistic
archaeologists
in
the
more
rational
hours
of
daylight
see
nothing
but
two
shapeless
rocks
it
may
have
been
noticed
however
that
all
englishmen
are
not
archaeologists
many
of
those
assembled
in
such
a
place
for
official
and
military
purposes
have
hobbies
other
than
archaeology
and
it
is
a
solemn
fact
that
the
english
in
this
eastern
exile
have
contrived
to
make
a
small
golf
links
out
of
the
green
scrub
and
sand
with
a
comfortable
clubhouse
at
one
end
of
it
and
this
primeval
monument
at
the
other
they
did
not
actually
use
this
archaic
abyss
as
a
bunker
because
it
was
by
tradition
unfathomable
and
even
for
practical
purposes
unfathomed
any
sporting
projectile
sent
into
it
might
be
counted
most
literally
as
a
lost
ball
but
they
often
sauntered
round
it
in
their
interludes
of
talking
and
smoking
cigarettes
and
one
of
them
had
just
come
down
from
the
clubhouse
to
find
another
gazing
somewhat
moodily
into
the
well
both
the
englishmen
wore
light
clothes
and
white
pith
helmets
and
puggrees
but
there
for
the
most
part
their
resemblance
ended
and
they
both
almost
simultaneously
said
the
same
word
but
they
said
it
on
two
totally
different
notes
of
the
voice
have
you
heard
the
news
asked
the
man
from
the
club
splendid
splendid
replied
the
man
by
the
well
but
the
first
man
pronounced
the
word
as
a
young
man
might
say
it
about
a
woman
and
the
second
as
an
old
man
might
say
it
about
the
weather
not
without
sincerity
but
certainly
without
fervor
and
in
this
the
tone
of
the
two
men
was
sufficiently
typical
of
them
the
first
who
was
a
certain
captain
boyle
was
of
a
bold
and
boyish
type
dark
and
with
a
sort
of
native
heat
in
his
face
that
did
not
belong
to
the
atmosphere
of
the
east
but
rather
to
the
ardors
and
ambitions
of
the
west
the
other
was
an
older
man
and
certainly
an
older
resident
a
civilian
official
horne
fisher
and
his
drooping
eyelids
and
drooping
light
mustache
expressed
all
the
paradox
of
the
englishman
in
the
east
he
was
much
too
hot
to
be
anything
but
cool
neither
of
them
thought
it
necessary
to
mention
what
it
was
that
was
splendid
that
would
indeed
have
been
superfluous
conversation
about
something
that
everybody
knew
the
striking
victory
over
a
menacing
combination
of
turks
and
arabs
in
the
north
won
by
troops
under
the
command
of
lord
hastings
the
veteran
of
so
many
striking
victories
was
already
spread
by
the
newspapers
all
over
the
empire
let
alone
to
this
small
garrison
so
near
to
the
battlefield
now
no
other
nation
in
the
world
could
have
done
a
thing
like
that
cried
captain
boyle
emphatically
horne
fisher
was
still
looking
silently
into
the
well
a
moment
later
he
answered
we
certainly
have
the
art
of
unmaking
mistakes
that
'
s
where
the
poor
old
prussians
went
wrong
they
could
only
make
mistakes
and
stick
to
them
there
is
really
a
certain
talent
in
unmaking
a
mistake
what
do
you
mean
asked
boyle
what
mistakes
well
everybody
knows
it
looked
like
biting
off
more
than
he
could
chew
replied
horne
fisher
it
was
a
peculiarity
of
mr
fisher
that
he
always
said
that
everybody
knew
things
which
about
one
person
in
two
million
was
ever
allowed
to
hear
of
and
it
was
certainly
jolly
lucky
that
travers
turned
up
so
well
in
the
nick
of
time
odd
how
often
the
right
thing
'
s
been
done
for
us
by
the
second
in
command
even
when
a
great
man
was
first
in
command
like
colborne
at
waterloo
it
ought
to
add
a
whole
province
to
the
empire
observed
the
other
well
i
suppose
the
zimmernes
would
have
insisted
on
it
as
far
as
the
canal
observed
fisher
thoughtfully
though
everybody
knows
adding
provinces
does
not
always
pay
much
nowadays
captain
boyle
frowned
in
a
slightly
puzzled
fashion
being
cloudily
conscious
of
never
having
heard
of
the
zimmernes
in
his
life
he
could
only
remark
stolidly
well
one
ca
not
be
a
little
englander
horne
fisher
smiled
and
he
had
a
pleasant
smile
every
man
out
here
is
a
little
englander
he
said
he
wishes
he
were
back
in
little
england
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
am
afraid
said
the
younger
man
rather
suspiciously
one
would
think
you
did
not
really
admire
hastings
or
or
anything
i
admire
him
no
end
replied
fisher
he
is
by
far
the
best
man
for
this
post
he
understands
the
moslems
and
can
do
anything
with
them
that
'
s
why
i
am
all
against
pushing
travers
against
him
merely
because
of
this
last
affair
i
really
do
not
understand
what
you
are
driving
at
said
the
other
frankly
perhaps
it
is
not
worth
understanding
answered
fisher
lightly
and
anyhow
we
need
not
talk
politics
do
you
know
the
arab
legend
about
that
well
i
am
afraid
i
do
not
know
much
about
arab
legends
said
boyle
rather
stiffly
that
'
s
rather
a
mistake
replied
fisher
especially
from
your
point
of
view
lord
hastings
himself
is
an
arab
legend
that
is
perhaps
the
very
greatest
thing
he
really
is
if
his
reputation
went
it
would
weaken
us
all
over
asia
and
africa
well
the
story
about
that
hole
in
the
ground
that
goes
down
nobody
knows
where
has
always
fascinated
me
rather
it
is
mohammedan
in
form
now
but
i
should
not
wonder
if
the
tale
is
a
long
way
older
than
mohammed
it
is
all
about
somebody
they
call
the
sultan
aladdin
not
our
friend
of
the
lamp
of
course
but
rather
like
him
in
having
to
do
with
genii
or
giants
or
something
of
that
sort
they
say
he
commanded
the
giants
to
build
him
a
sort
of
pagoda
rising
higher
and
higher
above
all
the
stars
the
utmost
for
the
highest
as
the
people
said
when
they
built
the
tower
of
babel
but
the
builders
of
the
tower
of
babel
were
quite
modest
and
domestic
people
like
mice
compared
with
old
aladdin
they
only
wanted
a
tower
that
would
reach
heaven
a
mere
trifle
he
wanted
a
tower
that
would
pass
heaven
and
rise
above
it
and
go
on
rising
for
ever
and
ever
and
allah
cast
him
down
to
earth
with
a
thunderbolt
which
sank
into
the
earth
boring
a
hole
deeper
and
deeper
till
it
made
a
well
that
was
without
a
bottom
as
the
tower
was
to
have
been
without
a
top
and
down
that
inverted
tower
of
darkness
the
soul
of
the
proud
sultan
is
falling
forever
and
ever
what
a
queer
chap
you
are
said
boyle
you
talk
as
if
a
fellow
could
believe
those
fables
perhaps
i
believe
the
moral
and
not
the
fable
answered
fisher
but
here
comes
lady
hastings
you
know
her
i
think
the
clubhouse
on
the
golf
links
was
used
of
course
for
many
other
purposes
besides
that
of
golf
it
was
the
only
social
center
of
the
garrison
beside
the
strictly
military
headquarters
it
had
a
billiard
room
and
a
bar
and
even
an
excellent
reference
library
for
those
officers
who
were
so
perverse
as
to
take
their
profession
seriously
among
these
was
the
great
general
himself
whose
head
of
silver
and
face
of
bronze
like
that
of
a
brazen
eagle
were
often
to
be
found
bent
over
the
charts
and
folios
of
the
library
the
great
lord
hastings
believed
in
science
and
study
as
in
other
severe
ideals
of
life
and
had
given
much
paternal
advice
on
the
point
to
young
boyle
whose
appearances
in
that
place
of
research
were
rather
more
intermittent
it
was
from
one
of
these
snatches
of
study
that
the
young
man
had
just
come
out
through
the
glass
doors
of
the
library
on
to
the
golf
links
but
above
all
the
club
was
so
appointed
as
to
serve
the
social
conveniences
of
ladies
at
least
as
much
as
gentlemen
and
lady
hastings
was
able
to
play
the
queen
in
such
a
society
almost
as
much
as
in
her
own
ballroom
she
was
eminently
calculated
and
as
some
said
eminently
inclined
to
play
such
a
part
she
was
much
younger
than
her
husband
an
attractive
and
sometimes
dangerously
attractive
lady
and
mr
horne
fisher
looked
after
her
a
little
sardonically
as
she
swept
away
with
the
young
soldier
then
his
rather
dreary
eye
strayed
to
the
green
and
prickly
growths
round
the
well
growths
of
that
curious
cactus
formation
in
which
one
thick
leaf
grows
directly
out
of
the
other
without
stalk
or
twig
it
gave
his
fanciful
mind
a
sinister
feeling
of
a
blind
growth
without
shape
or
purpose
a
flower
or
shrub
in
the
west
grows
to
the
blossom
which
is
its
crown
and
is
content
but
this
was
as
if
hands
could
grow
out
of
hands
or
legs
grow
out
of
legs
in
a
nightmare
always
adding
a
province
to
the
empire
he
said
with
a
smile
and
then
added
more
sadly
but
i
doubt
if
i
was
right
after
all
a
strong
but
genial
voice
broke
in
on
his
meditations
and
he
looked
up
and
smiled
seeing
the
face
of
an
old
friend
the
voice
was
indeed
rather
more
genial
than
the
face
which
was
at
the
first
glance
decidedly
grim
it
was
a
typically
legal
face
with
angular
jaws
and
heavy
grizzled
eyebrows
and
it
belonged
to
an
eminently
legal
character
though
he
was
now
attached
in
a
semimilitary
capacity
to
the
police
of
that
wild
district
cuthbert
grayne
was
perhaps
more
of
a
criminologist
than
either
a
lawyer
or
a
policeman
but
in
his
more
barbarous
surroundings
he
had
proved
successful
in
turning
himself
into
a
practical
combination
of
all
three
the
discovery
of
a
whole
series
of
strange
oriental
crimes
stood
to
his
credit
but
as
few
people
were
acquainted
with
or
attracted
to
such
a
hobby
or
branch
of
knowledge
his
intellectual
life
was
somewhat
solitary
among
the
few
exceptions
was
horne
fisher
who
had
a
curious
capacity
for
talking
to
almost
anybody
about
almost
anything
studying
botany
or
is
it
archaeology
inquired
grayne
i
shall
never
come
to
the
end
of
your
interests
fisher
i
should
say
that
what
you
do
not
know
is
not
worth
knowing
you
are
wrong
replied
fisher
with
a
very
unusual
abruptness
'
and
even
bitterness
it
is
what
i
do
know
that
is
not
worth
knowing
all
the
seamy
side
of
things
all
the
secret
reasons
and
rotten
motives
and
bribery
arid
blackmail
they
call
politics
i
need
not
be
so
proud
of
having
been
down
all
these
sewers
that
i
should
brag
about
it
to
the
little
boys
in
the
street
what
do
you
mean
what
'
s
the
matter
with
you
asked
his
friend
i
never
knew
you
taken
like
this
before
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
replied
fisher
i
'
ve
just
been
throwing
cold
water
on
the
enthusiasms
of
a
boy
even
that
explanation
is
hardly
exhaustive
observed
the
criminal
expert
damned
newspaper
nonsense
the
enthusiasms
were
of
course
continued
fisher
but
i
ought
to
know
that
at
that
age
illusions
can
be
ideals
and
they
are
better
than
the
reality
anyhow
but
there
is
one
very
ugly
responsibility
about
jolting
a
young
man
out
of
the
rut
of
the
most
rotten
ideal
and
what
may
that
be
inquired
his
friend
it
is
very
apt
to
set
him
off
with
the
same
energy
in
a
much
worse
direction
answered
fisher
a
pretty
endless
sort
of
direction
a
bottomless
pit
as
deep
as
the
bottomless
well
fisher
did
not
see
his
friend
until
a
fortnight
later
when
he
found
himself
in
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
clubhouse
on
the
opposite
side
from
the
links
a
garden
heavily
colored
and
scented
with
sweet
semitropical
plants
in
the
glow
of
a
desert
sunset
two
other
men
were
with
him
the
third
being
the
now
celebrated
second
in
command
familiar
to
everybody
as
tom
travers
a
lean
dark
man
who
looked
older
than
his
years
with
a
furrow
in
his
brow
and
something
morose
about
the
very
shape
of
his
black
mustache
they
had
just
been
served
with
black
coffee
by
the
arab
now
officiating
as
the
temporary
servant
of
the
club
though
he
was
a
figure
already
familiar
and
even
famous
as
the
old
servant
of
the
general
he
went
by
the
name
of
said
and
was
notable
among
other
semites
for
that
unnatural
length
of
his
yellow
face
and
height
of
his
narrow
forehead
which
is
sometimes
seen
among
them
and
gave
an
irrational
impression
of
something
sinister
in
spite
of
his
agreeable
smile
i
never
feel
as
if
i
could
quite
trust
that
fellow
said
grayne
when
the
man
had
gone
away
it
is
very
unjust
i
take
it
for
he
was
certainly
devoted
to
hastings
and
saved
his
life
they
say
but
arabs
are
often
like
that
loyal
to
one
man
i
ca
not
help
feeling
he
might
cut
anybody
else
'
s
throat
and
even
do
it
treacherously
well
said
travers
with
a
rather
sour
smile
so
long
as
he
leaves
hastings
alone
the
world
wo
not
mind
much
there
was
a
rather
embarrassing
silence
full
of
memories
of
the
great
battle
and
then
horne
fisher
said
quietly
the
newspapers
are
not
the
world
tom
do
not
you
worry
about
them
everybody
in
your
world
knows
the
truth
well
enough
i
think
we
'
d
better
not
talk
about
the
general
just
now
remarked
grayne
for
he
is
just
coming
out
of
the
club
he
is
not
coming
here
said
fisher
he
is
only
seeing
his
wife
to
the
car
as
he
spoke
indeed
the
lady
came
out
on
the
steps
of
the
club
followed
by
her
husband
who
then
went
swiftly
in
front
of
her
to
open
the
garden
gate
as
he
did
so
she
turned
back
and
spoke
for
a
moment
to
a
solitary
man
still
sitting
in
a
cane
chair
in
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
the
only
man
left
in
the
deserted
club
save
for
the
three
that
lingered
in
the
garden
fisher
peered
for
a
moment
into
the
shadow
and
saw
that
it
was
captain
boyle
the
next
moment
rather
to
their
surprise
the
general
reappeared
and
remounting
the
steps
spoke
a
word
or
two
to
boyle
in
his
turn
then
he
signaled
to
said
who
hurried
up
with
two
cups
of
coffee
and
the
two
men
re
-
entered
the
club
each
carrying
his
cup
in
his
hand
the
next
moment
a
gleam
of
white
light
in
the
growing
darkness
showed
that
the
electric
lamps
had
been
turned
on
in
the
library
beyond
coffee
and
scientific
researches
said
travers
grimly
all
the
luxuries
of
learning
and
theoretical
research
well
i
must
be
going
for
i
have
my
work
to
do
as
well
and
he
got
up
rather
stiffly
saluted
his
companions
and
strode
away
into
the
dusk
i
only
hope
boyle
is
sticking
to
scientific
researches
said
horne
fisher
i
am
not
very
comfortable
about
him
myself
but
let
'
s
talk
about
something
else
they
talked
about
something
else
longer
than
they
probably
imagined
until
the
tropical
night
had
come
and
a
splendid
moon
painted
the
whole
scene
with
silver
but
before
it
was
bright
enough
to
see
by
fisher
had
already
noted
that
the
lights
in
the
library
had
been
abruptly
extinguished
he
waited
for
the
two
men
to
come
out
by
the
garden
entrance
but
nobody
came
they
must
have
gone
for
a
stroll
on
the
links
he
said
very
possibly
replied
grayne
it
is
going
to
be
a
beautiful
night
a
moment
or
two
after
he
had
spoken
they
heard
a
voice
hailing
them
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
clubhouse
and
were
astonished
to
perceive
travers
hurrying
toward
them
calling
out
as
he
came
i
shall
want
your
help
you
fellows
he
cried
there
'
s
something
pretty
bad
out
on
the
links
they
found
themselves
plunging
through
the
club
smoking
room
and
the
library
beyond
in
complete
darkness
mental
as
well
as
material
but
horne
fisher
in
spite
of
his
affectation
of
indifference
was
a
person
of
a
curious
and
almost
transcendental
sensibility
to
atmospheres
and
he
already
felt
the
presence
of
something
more
than
an
accident
he
collided
with
a
piece
of
furniture
in
the
library
and
almost
shuddered
with
the
shock
for
the
thing
moved
as
he
could
never
have
fancied
a
piece
of
furniture
moving
it
seemed
to
move
like
a
living
thing
yielding
and
yet
striking
back
the
next
moment
grayne
had
turned
on
the
lights
and
he
saw
he
had
only
stumbled
against
one
of
the
revolving
bookstands
that
had
swung
round
and
struck
him
but
his
involuntary
recoil
had
revealed
to
him
his
own
subconscious
sense
of
something
mysterious
and
monstrous
there
were
several
of
these
revolving
bookcases
standing
here
and
there
about
the
library
on
one
of
them
stood
the
two
cups
of
coffee
and
on
another
a
large
open
book
it
was
budge
'
s
book
on
egyptian
hieroglyphics
with
colored
plates
of
strange
birds
and
gods
and
even
as
he
rushed
past
he
was
conscious
of
something
odd
about
the
fact
that
this
and
not
any
work
of
military
science
should
be
open
in
that
place
at
that
moment
he
was
even
conscious
of
the
gap
in
the
well
-
lined
bookshelf
from
which
it
had
been
taken
and
it
seemed
almost
to
gape
at
him
in
an
ugly
fashion
like
a
gap
in
the
teeth
of
some
sinister
face
a
run
brought
them
in
a
few
minutes
to
the
other
side
of
the
ground
in
front
of
the
bottomless
well
and
a
few
yards
from
it
in
a
moonlight
almost
as
broad
as
daylight
they
saw
what
they
had
come
to
see
the
great
lord
hastings
lay
prone
on
his
face
in
a
posture
in
which
there
was
a
touch
of
something
strange
and
stiff
with
one
elbow
erect
above
his
body
the
arm
being
doubled
and
his
big
bony
hand
clutching
the
rank
and
ragged
grass
a
few
feet
away
was
boyle
almost
as
motionless
but
supported
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
staring
at
the
body
it
might
have
been
no
more
than
shock
and
accident
but
there
was
something
ungainly
and
unnatural
about
the
quadrupedal
posture
and
the
gaping
face
it
was
as
if
his
reason
had
fled
from
him
behind
there
was
nothing
but
the
clear
blue
southern
sky
and
the
beginning
of
the
desert
except
for
the
two
great
broken
stones
in
front
of
the
well
and
it
was
in
such
a
light
and
atmosphere
that
men
could
fancy
they
traced
in
them
enormous
and
evil
faces
looking
down
horne
fisher
stooped
and
touched
the
strong
hand
that
was
still
clutching
the
grass
and
it
was
as
cold
as
a
stone
he
knelt
by
the
body
and
was
busy
for
a
moment
applying
other
tests
then
he
rose
again
and
said
with
a
sort
of
confident
despair
lord
hastings
is
dead
there
was
a
stony
silence
and
then
travers
remarked
gruffly
this
is
your
department
grayne
i
will
leave
you
to
question
captain
boyle
i
can
make
no
sense
of
what
he
says
boyle
had
pulled
himself
together
and
risen
to
his
feet
but
his
face
still
wore
an
awful
expression
making
it
like
a
new
mask
or
the
face
of
another
man
i
was
looking
at
the
well
he
said
and
when
i
turned
he
had
fallen
down
grayne
'
s
face
was
very
dark
as
you
say
this
is
my
affair
he
said
i
must
first
ask
you
to
help
me
carry
him
to
the
library
and
let
me
examine
things
thoroughly
when
they
had
deposited
the
body
in
the
library
grayne
turned
to
fisher
and
said
in
a
voice
that
had
recovered
its
fullness
and
confidence
i
am
going
to
lock
myself
in
and
make
a
thorough
examination
first
i
look
to
you
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
others
and
make
a
preliminary
examination
of
boyle
i
will
talk
to
him
later
and
just
telephone
to
headquarters
for
a
policeman
and
let
him
come
here
at
once
and
stand
by
till
i
want
him
without
more
words
the
great
criminal
investigator
went
into
the
lighted
library
shutting
the
door
behind
him
and
fisher
without
replying
turned
and
began
to
talk
quietly
to
travers
it
is
curious
he
said
that
the
thing
should
happen
just
in
front
of
that
place
it
would
certainly
be
very
curious
replied
travers
if
the
place
played
any
part
in
it
i
think
replied
fisher
that
the
part
it
did
not
play
is
more
curious
still
and
with
these
apparently
meaningless
words
he
turned
to
the
shaken
boyle
and
taking
his
arm
began
to
walk
him
up
and
down
in
the
moonlight
talking
in
low
tones
dawn
had
begun
to
break
abrupt
and
white
when
cuthbert
grayne
turned
out
the
lights
in
the
library
and
came
out
on
to
the
links
fisher
was
lounging
about
alone
in
his
listless
fashion
but
the
police
messenger
for
whom
he
had
sent
was
standing
at
attention
in
the
background
i
sent
boyle
off
with
travers
observed
fisher
carelessly
he
will
look
after
him
and
he
'
d
better
have
some
sleep
anyhow
did
you
get
anything
out
of
him
asked
grayne
did
he
tell
you
what
he
and
hastings
were
doing
yes
answered
fisher
he
gave
me
a
pretty
clear
account
after
all
he
said
that
after
lady
hastings
went
off
in
the
car
the
general
asked
him
to
take
coffee
with
him
in
the
library
and
look
up
a
point
about
local
antiquities
he
himself
was
beginning
to
look
for
budge
'
s
book
in
one
of
the
revolving
bookstands
when
the
general
found
it
in
one
of
the
bookshelves
on
the
wall
after
looking
at
some
of
the
plates
they
went
out
it
would
seem
rather
abruptly
on
to
the
links
and
walked
toward
the
old
well
and
while
boyle
was
looking
into
it
he
heard
a
thud
behind
him
and
turned
round
to
find
the
general
lying
as
we
found
him
he
himself
dropped
on
his
knees
to
examine
the
body
and
then
was
paralyzed
with
a
sort
of
terror
and
could
not
come
nearer
to
it
or
touch
it
but
i
think
very
little
of
that
people
caught
in
a
real
shock
of
surprise
are
sometimes
found
in
the
queerest
postures
grayne
wore
a
grim
smile
of
attention
and
said
after
a
short
silence
well
he
has
not
told
you
many
lies
it
is
really
a
creditably
clear
and
consistent
account
of
what
happened
with
everything
of
importance
left
out
have
you
discovered
anything
in
there
asked
fisher
i
have
discovered
everything
answered
grayne
fisher
maintained
a
somewhat
gloomy
silence
as
the
other
resumed
his
explanation
in
quiet
and
assured
tones
you
were
quite
right
fisher
when
you
said
that
young
fellow
was
in
danger
of
going
down
dark
ways
toward
the
pit
whether
or
no
as
you
fancied
the
jolt
you
gave
to
his
view
of
the
general
had
anything
to
do
with
it
he
has
not
been
treating
the
general
well
for
some
time
it
is
an
unpleasant
business
and
i
do
not
want
to
dwell
on
it
but
it
is
pretty
plain
that
his
wife
was
not
treating
him
well
either
i
do
not
know
how
far
it
went
but
it
went
as
far
as
concealment
anyhow
for
when
lady
hastings
spoke
to
boyle
it
was
to
tell
him
she
had
hidden
a
note
in
the
budge
book
in
the
library
the
general
overheard
or
came
somehow
to
know
and
he
went
straight
to
the
book
and
found
it
he
confronted
boyle
with
it
and
they
had
a
scene
of
course
and
boyle
was
confronted
with
something
else
he
was
confronted
with
an
awful
alternative
in
which
the
life
of
one
old
man
meant
ruin
and
his
death
meant
triumph
and
even
happiness
well
observed
fisher
at
last
i
do
not
blame
him
for
not
telling
you
the
woman
'
s
part
of
the
story
but
how
do
you
know
about
the
letter
i
found
it
on
the
general
'
s
body
answered
grayne
but
i
found
worse
things
than
that
the
body
had
stiffened
in
the
way
rather
peculiar
to
poisons
of
a
certain
asiatic
sort
then
i
examined
the
coffee
cups
and
i
knew
enough
chemistry
to
find
poison
in
the
dregs
of
one
of
them
now
the
general
went
straight
to
the
bookcase
leaving
his
cup
of
coffee
on
the
bookstand
in
the
middle
of
the
room
while
his
back
was
turned
and
boyle
was
pretending
to
examine
the
bookstand
he
was
left
alone
with
the
coffee
cup
the
poison
takes
about
ten
minutes
to
act
and
ten
minutes
'
walk
would
bring
them
to
the
bottomless
well
yes
remarked
fisher
and
what
about
the
bottomless
well
what
has
the
bottomless
well
got
to
do
with
it
asked
his
friend
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
replied
fisher
that
is
what
i
find
utterly
confounding
and
incredible
and
why
should
that
particular
hole
in
the
ground
have
anything
to
do
with
it
it
is
a
particular
hole
in
your
case
said
fisher
but
i
wo
not
insist
on
that
just
now
by
the
way
there
is
another
thing
i
ought
to
tell
you
i
said
i
sent
boyle
away
in
charge
of
travers
it
would
be
just
as
true
to
say
i
sent
travers
in
charge
of
boyle
you
do
not
mean
to
say
you
suspect
tom
travers
cried
the
other
her
he
was
a
deal
bitterer
against
the
general
than
boyle
ever
was
observed
horne
fisher
with
a
curious
indifference
man
you
are
not
saying
what
you
mean
cried
grayne
i
tell
you
i
found
the
poison
in
one
of
the
coffee
cups
there
was
always
said
of
course
added
fisher
either
for
hatred
or
hire
we
agreed
he
was
capable
of
almost
anything
and
we
agreed
he
was
incapable
of
hurting
his
master
retorted
grayne
well
well
said
fisher
amiably
i
dare
say
you
are
right
but
i
should
just
like
to
have
a
look
at
the
library
and
the
coffee
cups
he
passed
inside
while
grayne
turned
to
the
policeman
in
attendance
and
handed
him
a
scribbled
note
to
be
telegraphed
from
headquarters
the
man
saluted
and
hurried
off
and
grayne
following
his
friend
into
the
library
found
him
beside
the
bookstand
in
the
middle
of
the
room
on
which
were
the
empty
cups
this
is
where
boyle
looked
for
budge
or
pretended
to
look
for
him
according
to
your
account
he
said
as
fisher
spoke
he
bent
down
in
a
half
-
crouching
attitude
to
look
at
the
volumes
in
the
low
revolving
shelf
for
the
whole
bookstand
was
not
much
higher
than
an
ordinary
table
the
next
moment
he
sprang
up
as
if
he
had
been
stung
oh
my
god
he
cried
very
few
people
if
any
had
ever
seen
mr
horne
fisher
behave
as
he
behaved
just
then
he
flashed
a
glance
at
the
door
saw
that
the
open
window
was
nearer
went
out
of
it
with
a
flying
leap
as
if
over
a
hurdle
and
went
racing
across
the
turf
in
the
track
of
the
disappearing
policeman
grayne
who
stood
staring
after
him
soon
saw
his
tall
loose
figure
returning
restored
to
all
its
normal
limpness
and
air
of
leisure
he
was
fanning
himself
slowly
with
a
piece
of
paper
the
telegram
he
had
so
violently
intercepted
lucky
i
stopped
that
he
observed
we
must
keep
this
affair
as
quiet
as
death
hastings
must
die
of
apoplexy
or
heart
disease
what
on
earth
is
the
trouble
demanded
the
other
investigator
the
trouble
is
said
fisher
that
in
a
few
days
we
should
have
had
a
very
agreeable
alternative
of
hanging
an
innocent
man
or
knocking
the
british
empire
to
hell
do
you
mean
to
say
asked
grayne
that
this
infernal
crime
is
not
to
be
punished
fisher
looked
at
him
steadily
