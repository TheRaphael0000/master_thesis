he
had
not
gone
far
before
a
turn
in
the
path
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
now
rapidly
widening
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
showed
him
two
high
towers
,
seemingly
some
two
miles
off
;
these
he
felt
sure
must
be
at
sunch
'
ston
,
he
therefore
stepped
out
,
lest
he
should
find
the
shops
shut
before
he
got
there
.
on
his
former
visit
he
had
seen
little
of
the
town
,
for
he
was
in
prison
during
his
whole
stay
.
he
had
had
a
glimpse
of
it
on
being
brought
there
by
the
people
of
the
village
where
he
had
spent
his
first
night
in
erewhon
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
village
which
he
had
seen
at
some
little
distance
on
his
right
hand
,
but
which
it
would
have
been
out
of
his
way
to
visit
,
even
if
he
had
wished
to
do
so
;
and
he
had
seen
the
museum
of
old
machines
,
but
on
leaving
the
prison
he
had
been
blindfolded
.
nevertheless
he
felt
sure
that
if
the
towers
had
been
there
he
should
have
seen
them
,
and
rightly
guessed
that
they
must
belong
to
the
temple
which
was
to
be
dedicated
to
himself
on
sunday
.
when
he
had
passed
through
the
suburbs
he
found
himself
in
the
main
street
.
space
will
not
allow
me
to
dwell
on
more
than
a
few
of
the
things
which
caught
his
eye
,
and
assured
him
that
the
change
in
erewhonian
habits
and
opinions
had
been
even
more
cataclysmic
than
he
had
already
divined
.
the
first
important
building
that
he
came
to
proclaimed
itself
as
the
college
of
spiritual
athletics
,
and
in
the
window
of
a
shop
that
was
evidently
affiliated
to
the
college
he
saw
an
announcement
that
moral
try
-
your
-
strengths
,
suitable
for
every
kind
of
ordinary
temptation
,
would
be
provided
on
the
shortest
notice
.
some
of
those
that
aimed
at
the
more
common
kinds
of
temptation
were
kept
in
stock
,
but
these
consisted
chiefly
of
trials
to
the
temper
.
on
dropping
,
for
example
,
a
penny
into
a
slot
,
you
could
have
a
jet
of
fine
pepper
,
flour
,
or
brickdust
,
whichever
you
might
prefer
,
thrown
on
to
your
face
,
and
thus
discover
whether
your
composure
stood
in
need
of
further
development
or
no
.
my
father
gathered
this
from
the
writing
that
was
pasted
on
to
the
try
-
your
-
strength
,
but
he
had
no
time
to
go
inside
the
shop
and
test
either
the
machine
or
his
own
temper
.
other
temptations
to
irritability
required
the
agency
of
living
people
,
or
at
any
rate
living
beings
.
crying
children
,
screaming
parrots
,
a
spiteful
monkey
,
might
be
hired
on
ridiculously
easy
terms
.
he
saw
one
advertisement
,
nicely
framed
,
which
ran
as
follows
:
-

"
then
followed
a
series
of
testimonials
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
example
:
-
"
dear
mrs
tantrums

.
.

.
i
have
for
years
been
tortured
with
a
husband
of
unusually
peevish
,
irritable
temper
,
who
made
my
life
so
intolerable
that
i
sometimes
answered
him
in
a
way
that
led
to
his
using
personal
violence
towards
me
.
after
taking
a
course
of
twelve
sittings
from
you
,
i
found
my
husband
'
s
temper
comparatively
angelic
,
and
we
have
ever
since
lived
together
in
complete

"
another
was

a

:

his
compliments
to

and
begs
to
assure
her
that
her
extra
special
hysterics
have
so
far
surpassed
anything
his
wife
can
do
,
as
to
render
him
callous
to
those
attacks
which
he
had
formerly
found
so
distressing
.
"
there
were
many
others
of
a
like
purport
,
but
time
did
not
permit
my
father
to
do
more
than
glance
at
them
.
he
contented
himself
with
the
two
following
,
of
which
the
first
ran
:
-
"

kind

in

twenty
minutes

single
dose
of

"
tearing
himself
away
from
the
college
of
spiritual
athletics
and
its
affiliated
shop
,
he
passed
on
a
few
doors
,
only
to
find
himself
looking
in
at
what
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
chemist
'
s
shop
.
in
the
window
there
were
advertisements
which
showed
that
the
practice
of
medicine
was
now
legal
,
but
my
father
could
not
stay
to
copy
a
single
one
of
the
fantastic
announcements
that
a
hurried
glance
revealed
to
him
.
it
was
also
plain
here
,
as
from
the
shop
already
more
fully
described
,
that
the
edicts
against
machines
had
been
repealed
,
for
there
were
physical
try
-
your
-
strengths
,
as
in
the
other
shop
there
had
been
moral
ones
,
and
such
machines
under
the
old
law
would
not
have
been
tolerated
for
a
moment
.
my
father
made
his
purchases
just
as
the
last
shops
were
closing
.
he
noticed
that
almost
all
of
them
were
full
of
articles
labelled
"
dedication
.
"
there
was
dedication
gingerbread
,
stamped
with
a
moulded
representation
of
the
new
temple
;
there
were
dedication
syrups
,
dedication
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
,
also
shewing
the
temple
,
and
in
one
corner
giving
a
highly
idealised
portrait
of
my
father
himself
.
the
chariot
and
the
horses
figured
largely
,
and
in
the
confectioners
'
shops
there
were
models
of
the
newly
discovered
relic
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
made
,
so
my
father
thought
,
with
a
little
heap
of
cherries
or
strawberries
,
smothered
in
chocolate
.
outside
one
tailor
'
s
shop
he
saw
a
flaring
advertisement
which
can
only
be
translated
,
"
try
our
dedication
trousers
,
price
ten
shillings
and
sixpence
.
"
presently
he
passed
the
new
temple
,
but
it
was
too
dark
for
him
to
do
more
than
see
that
it
was
a
vast
fane
,
and
must
have
cost
an
untold
amount
of
money
.
at
every
turn
he
found
himself
more
and
more
shocked
,
as
he
realised
more
and
more
fully
the
mischief
he
had
already
occasioned
,
and
the
certainty
that
this
was
small
as
compared
with
that
which
would
grow
up
hereafter
.
"
what
,
"
he
said
to
me
,
very
coherently
and
quietly
,
"
was
i
to
do
?
i
had
struck
a
bargain
with
that
dear
fellow
,
though
he
knew
not
what
i
meant
,
to
the
effect
that
i
should
try
to
undo
the
harm
i
had
done
,
by
standing
up
before
the
people
on
sunday
and
saying
who
i
was
.
true
,
they
would
not
believe
me
.
they
would
look
at
my
hair
and
see
it
black
,
whereas
it
should
be
very
light
.
on
this
they
would
look
no
further
,
but
very
likely
tear
me
in
pieces
then
and
there
.
suppose
that
the
authorities
held
a
post
-
mortem
examination
,
and
that
many
who
knew
me
(
let
alone
that
all
my
measurements
and
marks
were
recorded
twenty
years
ago
)
identified
the
body
as
mine
:
would
those
in
power
admit
that
i
was
the
sunchild
?
not
they
.
the
interests
vested
in
my
being
now
in
the
palace
of
the
sun
are
too
great
to
allow
of
my
having
been
torn
to
pieces
in
sunch
'
ston
,
no
matter
how
truly
i
had
been
torn
;
the
whole
thing
would
be
hushed
up
,
and
the
utmost
that
could
come
of
it
would
be
a
heresy
which
would
in
time
be
crushed
.
"
on
the
other
hand
,
what
business
have
i
with
'
would
be
'
or
'
would
not
be
?
'
should
i
not
speak
out
,
come
what
may
,
when
i
see
a
whole
people
being
led
astray
by
those
who
are
merely
exploiting
them
for
their
own
ends
?
though
i
could
do
but
little
,
ought
i
not
to
do
that
little
?
what
did
that
good
fellow
'
s
instinct
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
so
straight
from
heaven
,
so
true
,
so
healthy
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
tell
him
?
what
did
my
own
instinct
answer
?
what
would
the
conscience
of
any
honourable
man
answer
?
who
can
doubt
?
"
and
yet
,
is
there
not
reason
?
and
is
it
not
god
-
given
as
much
as
instinct
?
i
remember
having
heard
an
anthem
in
my
young
days
,
'
o
where
shall
wisdom
be
found
?
the
deep
saith
it
is
not
in
me
.
'
as
the
singers
kept
on
repeating
the
question
,
i
kept
on
saying
sorrowfully
to
myself
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
'
ah
,
where
,
where
,
where
?
'
and
when
the
triumphant
answer
came
,
'
the
fear
of
the
lord
,
that
is
wisdom
,
and
to
depart
from
evil
is
understanding
,
'
i
shrunk
ashamed
into
myself
for
not
having
foreseen
it
.
in
later
life
,
when
i
have
tried
to
use
this
answer
as
a
light
by
which
i
could
walk
,
i
found
it
served
but
to
the
raising
of
another
question
,
'
what
is
the
fear
of
the
lord
,
and
what
is
evil
in
this
particular
case
?
'
and
my
easy
method
with
spiritual
dilemmas
proved
to
be
but
a
case
of
ignotum
per
ignotius
.
"
if
satan
himself
is
at
times
transformed
into
an
angel
of
light
,
are
not
angels
of
light
sometimes
transformed
into
the
likeness
of
satan
?
if
the
devil
is
not
so
black
as
he
is
painted
,
is
god
always
so
white
?
and
is
there
not
another
place
in
which
it
is
said
,
'
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
,
'
as
though
it
were
not
the
last
word
upon
the
subject
?
if
a
man
should
not
do
evil
that
good
may
come
,
so
neither
should
he
do
good
that
evil
may
come
;
and
though
it
were
good
for
me
to
speak
out
,
should
i
not
do
better
by
refraining
?
"
such
were
the
lawless
and
uncertain
thoughts
that
tortured
me
very
cruelly
,
so
that
i
did
what
i
had
not
done
for
many
a
long
year
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
prayed
for
guidance
.
'
shew
me
thy
will
,
o
lord
,
'
i
cried
in
great
distress
,
'
and
strengthen
me
to
do
it
when
thou
hast
shewn
it
me
.
'
but
there
was
no
answer
.
instinct
tore
me
one
way
and
reason
another
.
whereon
i
settled
that
i
would
obey
the
reason
with
which
god
had
endowed
me
,
unless
the
instinct
he
had
also
given
me
should
thrash
it
out
of
me
.
i
could
get
no
further
than
this
,
that
the
lord
hath
mercy
on
whom
he
will
have
mercy
,
and
whom
he
willeth
he
hardeneth
;
and
again
i
prayed
that
i
might
be
among
those
on
whom
he
would
shew
his
mercy
.
"
this
was
the
strongest
internal
conflict
that
i
ever
remember
to
have
felt
,
and
it
was
at
the
end
of
it
that
i
perceived
the
first
,
but
as
yet
very
faint
,
symptoms
of
that
sickness
from
which
i
shall
not
recover
.
whether
this
be
a
token
of
mercy
or
no
,
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
knows
,
but
i
know
not
.
"
from
what
my
father
afterwards
told
me
,
i
do
not
think
the
above
reflections
had
engrossed
him
for
more
than
three
or
four
minutes
;
the
giddiness
which
had
for
some
seconds
compelled
him
to
lay
hold
of
the
first
thing
he
could
catch
at
in
order
to
avoid
falling
,
passed
away
without
leaving
a
trace
behind
it
,
and
his
path
seemed
to
become
comfortably
clear
before
him
.
he
settled
it
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
would
be
to
buy
some
food
,
start
back
at
once
while
his
permit
was
still
valid
,
help
himself
to
the
property
which
he
had
sold
the
professors
,
leaving
the
erewhonians
to
wrestle
as
they
best
might
with
the
lot
that
it
had
pleased
heaven
to
send
them
.
this
,
however
,
was
too
heroic
a
course
.
he
was
tired
,
and
wanted
a
night
'
s
rest
in
a
bed
;
he
was
hungry
,
and
wanted
a
substantial
meal
;
he
was
curious
,
moreover
,
to
see
the
temple
dedicated
to
himself
,
and
hear
hanky
'
s
sermon
;
there
was
also
this
further
difficulty
,
he
should
have
to
take
what
he
had
sold
the
professors
without
returning
them
their
4
pounds
,
10s
.
,
for
he
could
not
do
without
his
blanket
,
&
c
.
;
and
even
if
he
left
a
bag
of
nuggets
made
fast
to
the
sucker
,
he
must
either
place
it
where
it
could
be
seen
so
easily
that
it
would
very
likely
get
stolen
,
or
hide
it
so
cleverly
that
the
professors
would
never
find
it
.
he
therefore
compromised
by
concluding
that
he
would
sup
and
sleep
in
sunch
'
ston
,
get
through
the
morrow
as
he
best
could
without
attracting
attention
,
deepen
the
stain
on
his
face
and
hair
,
and
rely
on
the
change
so
made
in
his
appearance
to
prevent
his
being
recognised
at
the
dedication
of

he
would
do
nothing
to
disillusion
the
people
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
do
this
would
only
be
making
bad
worse
.
as
soon
as
the
service
was
over
,
he
would
set
out
towards
the
preserves
,
and
,
when
it
was
well
dark
,
make
for
the
statues
.
he
hoped
that
on
such
a
great
day
the
rangers
might
be
many
of
them
in
sunch
'
ston
;
if
there
were
any
about
,
he
must
trust
the
moonless
night
and
his
own
quick
eyes
and
ears
to
get
him
through
the
preserves
safely
.
the
shops
were
by
this
time
closed
,
but
the
keepers
of
a
few
stalls
were
trying
by
lamplight
to
sell
the
wares
they
had
not
yet
got
rid
of
.
one
of
these
was
a
bookstall
,
and
,
running
his
eye
over
some
of
the
volumes
,
my
father
saw
one
entitled
-
"
the
sayings
of
the
sunchild
during
his
stay
in

,
to
which
is
added
a

there
were
many
other
books
whose
titles
would
probably
have
attracted
my
father
as
much
as
those
that
i
have
given
,
but
he
was
too
tired
and
hungry
to
look
at
more
.
finding
that
he
could
buy
all
the
foregoing
for
4s
.
9d
.
,
he
bought
them
and
stuffed
them
into
the
valise
that
he
had
just
bought
.
his
purchases
in
all
had
now
amounted
to
a
little
over
1
pound
,
10s
.
(
silver
)
,
leaving
him
about
3
pounds
(
silver
)
,
including
the
money
for
which
he
had
sold
the
quails
,
to
carry
him
on
till
sunday
afternoon
.
he
intended
to
spend
say
2
pounds
(
silver
)
,
and
keep
the
rest
of
the
money
in
order
to
give
it
to
the
british
museum
.
he
now
began
to
search
for
an
inn
,
and
walked
about
the
less
fashionable
parts
of
the
town
till
he
found
an
unpretending
tavern
,
which
he
thought
would
suit
him
.
here
,
on
importunity
,
he
was
given
a
servant
'
s
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
all
others
being
engaged
by
visitors
who
had
come
for
the
dedication
.
he
ordered
a
meal
,
of
which
he
stood
in
great
need
,
and
having
eaten
it
,
he
retired
early
for
the
night
.
but
he
smoked
a
pipe
surreptitiously
up
the
chimney
before
he
got
into
bed
.
meanwhile
other
things
were
happening
,
of
which
,
happily
for
his
repose
,
he
was
still
ignorant
,
and
which
he
did
not
learn
till
a
few
days
later
.
not
to
depart
from
chronological
order
i
will
deal
with
them
in
my
next
chapter
.
the
professors
,
returning
to
their
hotel
early
on
the
friday
morning
,
found
a
note
from
the
mayoress
urging
them
to
be
her
guests
during
the
remainder
of
their
visit
,
and
to
meet
other
friends
at
dinner
on
this
same
evening
.
they
accepted
,
and
then
went
to
bed
;
for
they
had
passed
the
night
under
the
tree
in
which
they
had
hidden
their
purchase
,
and
,
as
may
be
imagined
,
had
slept
but
little
.
they
rested
all
day
,
and
transferred
themselves
and
their
belongings
to
the
mayor
'
s
house
in
time
to
dress
for
dinner
.
when
they
came
down
into
the
drawing
-
room
they
found
a
brilliant
company
assembled
,
chiefly
musical
-
bankical
like
themselves
.
there
was
dr
downie
,
professor
of
logomachy
,
and
perhaps
the
most
subtle
dialectician
in
erewhon
.
he
could
say
nothing
in
more
words
than
any
man
of
his
generation
.
his
text
-
book
on
the
"
art
of
obscuring
issues
"
had
passed
through
ten
or
twelve
editions
,
and
was
in
the
hands
of
all
aspirants
for
academic
distinction
.
he
had
earned
a
high
reputation
for
sobriety
of
judgement
by
resolutely
refusing
to
have
definite
views
on
any
subject
;
so
safe
a
man
was
he
considered
,
that
while
still
quite
young
he
had
been
appointed
to
the
lucrative
post
of
thinker
in
ordinary
to
the
royal
family
.
there
was
mr
principal
crank
,
with
his
sister
mrs
quack
;
professors
gabb
and
bawl
,
with
their
wives
and
two
or
three
erudite
daughters
.
old
mrs
humdrum
(
of
whom
more
anon
)
was
there
of
course
,
with
her
venerable
white
hair
and
rich
black
satin
dress
,
looking
the
very
ideal
of
all
that
a
stately
old
dowager
ought
to
be
.
in
society
she
was
commonly
known
as
ydgrun
,
so
perfectly
did
she
correspond
with
the
conception
of
this
strange
goddess
formed
by
the
erewhonians
.
she
was
one
of
those
who
had
visited
my
father
when
he
was
in
prison
twenty
years
earlier
.
when
he
told
me
that
she
was
now
called
ydgrun
,
he
said
,
"
i
am
sure
that
the
erinyes
were
only
mrs
humdrums
,
and
that
they
were
delightful
people
when
you
came
to
know
them
.
i
do
not
believe
they
did
the
awful
things
we
say
they
did
.
i
think
,
but
am
not
quite
sure
,
that
they
let
orestes
off
;
but
even
though
they
had
not
pardoned
him
,
i
doubt
whether
they
would
have
done
anything
more
dreadful
to
him
than
issue
a
mot
d
'
ordre
that
he
was
not
to
be
asked
to
any
more
afternoon
teas
.
this
,
however
,
would
be
down
-
right
torture
to
some
people
.
at
any
rate
,
"
he
continued
,
"
be
it
the
erinyes
,
or
mrs
grundy
,
or
ydgrun
,
in
all
times
and
places
it
is
woman
who
decides
whether
society
is
to
condone
an
offence
or
no
.
"
among
the
most
attractive
ladies
present
was
one
for
whose
erewhonian
name
i
can
find
no
english
equivalent
,
and
whom
i
must
therefore
call
miss
la
frime
.
she
was
lady
president
of
the
principal
establishment
for
the
higher
education
of
young
ladies
,
and
so
celebrated
was
she
,
that
pupils
flocked
to
her
from
all
parts
of
the
surrounding
country
.
her
primer
(
written
for
the
erewhonian
arts
and
science
series
)
on
the
art
of
man
-
killing
,
was
the
most
complete
thing
of
the
kind
that
had
yet
been
done
;
but
ill
-
natured
people
had
been
heard
to
say
that
she
had
killed
all
her
own
admirers
so
effectually
that
not
one
of
them
had
ever
lived
to
marry
her
.
according
to
erewhonian
custom
the
successful
marriages
of
the
pupils
are
inscribed
yearly
on
the
oak
paneling
of
the
college
refectory
,
and
a
reprint
from
these
in
pamphlet
form
accompanies
all
the
prospectuses
that
are
sent
out
to
parents
.
it
was
alleged
that
no
other
ladies
'
seminary
in
erewhon
could
show
such
a
brilliant
record
during
all
the
years
of
miss
la
frime
'
s
presidency
.
many
other
guests
of
less
note
were
there
,
but
the
lions
of
the
evening
were
the
two
professors
whom
we
have
already
met
with
,
and
more
particularly
hanky
,
who
took
the
mayoress
in
to
dinner
.
panky
,
of
course
,
wore
his
clothes
reversed
,
as
did
principal
crank
and
professor
gabb
;
the
others
were
dressed
english
fashion
.
everything
hung
upon
the
hostess
,
for
the
host
was
little
more
than
a
still
handsome
figure
-
head
.
he
had
been
remarkable
for
his
good
looks
as
a
young
man
,
and
strong
is
the
nearest
approach
i
can
get
to
a
translation
of
his
erewhonian
name
.
his
face
inspired
confidence
at
once
,
but
he
was
a
man
of
few
words
,
and
had
little
of
that
grace
which
in
his
wife
set
every
one
instantly
at
his
or
her
ease
.
he
knew
that
all
would
go
well
so
long
as
he
left
everything
to
her
,
and
kept
himself
as
far
as
might
be
in
the
background
.
before
dinner
was
announced
there
was
the
usual
buzz
of
conversation
,
chiefly
occupied
with
salutations
,
good
wishes
for
sunday
'
s
weather
,
and
admiration
for
the
extreme
beauty
of
the
mayoress
'
s
three
daughters
,
the
two
elder
of
whom
were
already
out
;
while
the
third
,
though
only
thirteen
,
might
have
passed
for
a
year
or
two
older
.
their
mother
was
so
much
engrossed
with
receiving
her
guests
that
it
was
not
till
they
were
all
at
table
that
she
was
able
to
ask
hanky
what
he
thought
of
the
statues
,
which
she
had
heard
that
he
and
professor
panky
had
been
to
see
.
she
was
told
how
much
interested
he
had
been
with
them
,
and
how
unable
he
had
been
to
form
any
theory
as
to
their
date
or
object
.
he
then
added
,
appealing
to
panky
,
who
was
on
the
mayoress
'
s
left
hand
,
"
but
we
had
rather
a
strange
adventure
on
our
way
down
,
had
we
not
,
panky
?
we
got
lost
,
and
were
benighted
in
the
forest
.
happily
we
fell
in
with
one
of
the
rangers
who
had
lit
a
fire
.
"
"
do
i
understand
,
then
,
"
said
yram
,
as
i
suppose
we
may
as
well
call
her
,
"
that
you
were
out
all
last
night
?
how
tired
you
must
be
!
but
i
hope
you
had
enough
provisions
with
you
?
"
"
indeed
we
were
out
all
night
.
we
staid
by
the
ranger
'
s
fire
till
midnight
,
and
then
tried
to
find
our
way
down
,
but
we
gave
it
up
soon
after
we
had
got
out
of
the
forest
,
and
then
waited
under
a
large
chestnut
tree
till
four
or
five
this
morning
.
as
for
food
,
we
had
not
so
much
as
a
mouthful
from
about
three
in
the
afternoon
till
we
got
to
our
inn
early
this
morning
.
"
"
oh
,
you
poor
,
poor
people
!
how
tired
you
must
be
.
"
"
no
;
we
made
a
good
breakfast
as
soon
as
we
got
in
,
and
then
went
to
bed
,
where
we
staid
till
it
was
time
for
us
to
come
to
your
house
.
"
here
panky
gave
his
friend
a
significant
look
,
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
had
said
enough
.
this
set
hanky
on
at
once
.
"
strange
to
say
,
the
ranger
was
wearing
the
old
erewhonian
dress
.
it
did
me
good
to
see
it
again
after
all
these
years
.
it
seems
your
son
lets
his
men
wear
what
few
of
the
old
clothes
they
may
still
have
,
so
long
as
they
keep
well
away
from
the
town
.
but
fancy
how
carefully
these
poor
fellows
husband
them
;
why
,
it
must
be
seventeen
years
since
the
dress
was
forbidden
!
"
we
all
of
us
have
skeletons
,
large
or
small
,
in
some
cupboard
of
our
lives
,
but
a
well
regulated
skeleton
that
will
stay
in
its
cupboard
quietly
does
not
much
matter
.
there
are
skeletons
,
however
,
which
can
never
be
quite
trusted
not
to
open
the
cupboard
door
at
some
awkward
moment
,
go
down
stairs
,
ring
the
hall
-
door
bell
,
with
grinning
face
announce
themselves
as
the
skeleton
,
and
ask
whether
the
master
or
mistress
is
at
home
.
this
kind
of
skeleton
,
though
no
bigger
than
a
rabbit
,
will
sometimes
loom
large
as
that
of
a
dinotherium
.
my
father
was
yram
'
s
skeleton
.
true
,
he
was
a
mere
skeleton
of
a
skeleton
,
for
the
chances
were
thousands
to
one
that
he
and
my
mother
had
perished
long
years
ago
;
and
even
though
he
rang
at
the
bell
,
there
was
no
harm
that
he
either
could
or
would
now
do
to
her
or
hers
;
still
,
so
long
as
she
did
not
certainly
know
that
he
was
dead
,
or
otherwise
precluded
from
returning
,
she
could
not
be
sure
that
he
would
not
one
day
come
back
by
the
way
that
he
would
alone
know
,
and
she
had
rather
he
should
not
do
so
.
hence
,
on
hearing
from
professor
hanky
that
a
man
had
been
seen
between
the
statues
and
sunch
'
ston
wearing
the
old
erewhonian
dress
,
she
was
disquieted
and
perplexed
.
the
excuse
he
had
evidently
made
to
the
professors
aggravated
her
uneasiness
,
for
it
was
an
obvious
attempt
to
escape
from
an
unexpected
difficulty
.
there
could
be
no
truth
in
it
.
her
son
would
as
soon
think
of
wearing
the
old
dress
himself
as
of
letting
his
men
do
so
;
and
as
for
having
old
clothes
still
to
wear
out
after
seventeen
years
,
no
one
but
a
bridgeford
professor
would
accept
this
.
she
saw
,
therefore
,
that
she
must
keep
her
wits
about
her
,
and
lead
her
guests
on
to
tell
her
as
much
as
they
could
be
induced
to
do
.
"
my
son
,
"
she
said
innocently
,
"
is
always
considerate
to
his
men
,
and
that
is
why
they
are
so
devoted
to
him
.
i
wonder
which
of
them
it
was
?
in
what
part
of
the
preserves
did
you
fall
in
with
him
?
"
hanky
described
the
place
,
and
gave
the
best
idea
he
could
of
my
father
'
s
appearance
.
"
of
course
he
was
swarthy
like
the
rest
of
us
?
"
"
i
saw
nothing
remarkable
about
him
,
except
that
his
eyes
were
blue
and
his
eyelashes
nearly
white
,
which
,
as
you
know
,
is
rare
in
erewhon
.
indeed
,
i
do
not
remember
ever
before
to
have
seen
a
man
with
dark
hair
and
complexion
but
light
eyelashes
.
nature
is
always
doing
something
unusual
.
"
"
i
have
no
doubt
,
"
said
yram
,
"
that
he
was
the
man
they
call
blacksheep
,
but
i
never
noticed
this
peculiarity
in
him
.
if
he
was
blacksheep
,
i
am
afraid
you
must
have
found
him
none
too
civil
;
he
is
a
rough
diamond
,
and
you
would
hardly
be
able
to
understand
his
uncouth
sunch
'
ston
dialect
.
"
"
on
the
contrary
,
he
was
most
kind
and
thoughtful
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
even
so
far
as
to
take
our
permit
from
us
,
and
thus
save
us
the
trouble
of
giving
it
up
at
your
son
'
s
office
.
as
for
his
dialect
,
his
grammar
was
often
at
fault
,
but
we
could
quite
understand
him
.
"
"
i
am
glad
to
hear
he
behaved
better
than
i
could
have
expected
.
did
he
say
in
what
part
of
the
preserves
he
had
been
?
"
"
he
had
been
catching
quails
between
the
place
where
we
saw
him
and
the
statues
;
he
was
to
deliver
three
dozen
to
your
son
this
afternoon
for
the
mayor
'
s
banquet
on
sunday
.
"
this
was
worse
and
worse
.
she
had
urged
her
son
to
provide
her
with
a
supply
of
quails
for
sunday
'
s
banquet
,
but
he
had
begged
her
not
to
insist
on
having
them
.
there
was
no
close
time
for
them
in
erewhon
,
but
he
set
his
face
against
their
being
seen
at
table
in
spring
and
summer
.
during
the
winter
,
when
any
great
occasion
arose
,
he
had
allowed
a
few
brace
to
be
provided
.
"
i
asked
my
son
to
let
me
have
some
,
"
said
yram
,
who
was
now
on
full
scent
.
she
laughed
genially
as
she
added
,
"
can
you
throw
any
light
upon
the
question
whether
i
am
likely
to
get
my
three
dozen
?
i
have
had
no
news
as
yet
.
"
"
the
man
had
taken
a
good
many
;
we
saw
them
but
did
not
count
them
.
he
started
about
midnight
for
the
ranger
'
s
shelter
,
where
he
said
he
should
sleep
till
daybreak
,
so
as
to
make
up
his
full
tale
betimes
.
"
yram
had
heard
her
son
complain
that
there
were
no
shelters
on
the
preserves
,
and
state
his
intention
of
having
some
built
before
the
winter
.
here
too
,
then
,
the
man
'
s
story
must
be
false
.
she
changed
the
conversation
for
the
moment
,
but
quietly
told
a
servant
to
send
high
and
low
in
search
of
her
son
,
and
if
he
could
be
found
,
to
bid
him
come
to
her
at
once
.
she
then
returned
to
her
previous
subject
.
"
and
did
not
this
heartless
wretch
,
knowing
how
hungry
you
must
both
be
,
let
you
have
a
quail
or
two
as
an
act
of
pardonable
charity
?
"
"
my
dear
mayoress
,
how
can
you
ask
such
a
question
?
we
knew
you
would
want
all
you
could
get
;
moreover
,
our
permit
threatened
us
with
all
sorts
of
horrors
if
we
so
much
as
ate
a
single
quail
.
i
assure
you
we
never
even
allowed
a
thought
of
eating
one
of
them
to
cross
our
minds
.
"
"
then
,
"
said
yram
to
herself
,
"
they
gorged
upon
them
.
"
what
could
she
think
?
a
man
who
wore
the
old
dress
,
and
therefore
who
had
almost
certainly
been
in
erewhon
,
but
had
been
many
years
away
from
it
;
who
spoke
the
language
well
,
but
whose
grammar
was
defective
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
hence
,
again
,
one
who
had
spent
some
time
in
erewhon
;
who
knew
nothing
of
the
afforesting
law
now
long
since
enacted
,
for
how
else
would
he
have
dared
to
light
a
fire
and
be
seen
with
quails
in
his
possession
;
an
adroit
liar
,
who
on
gleaning
information
from
the
professors
had
hazarded
an
excuse
for
immediately
retracing
his
steps
;
a
man
,
too
,
with
blue
eyes
and
light
eyelashes
.
what
did
it
matter
about
his
hair
being
dark
and
his
complexion
swarthy
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
higgs
was
far
too
clever
to
attempt
a
second
visit
to
erewhon
without
dyeing
his
hair
and
staining
his
face
and
hands
.
and
he
had
got
their
permit
out
of
the
professors
before
he
left
them
;
clearly
,
then
,
he
meant
coming
back
,
and
coming
back
at
once
before
the
permit
had
expired
.
how
could
she
doubt
?
my
father
,
she
felt
sure
,
must
by
this
time
be
in
sunch
'
ston
.
he
would
go
back
to
change
his
clothes
,
which
would
not
be
very
far
down
on
the
other
side
the
pass
,
for
he
would
not
put
on
his
old
erewhonian
dress
till
he
was
on
the
point
of
entering
erewhon
;
and
he
would
hide
his
english
dress
rather
than
throw
it
away
,
for
he
would
want
it
when
he
went
back
again
.
it
would
be
quite
possible
,
then
,
for
him
to
get
through
the
forest
before
the
permit
was
void
,
and
he
would
be
sure
to
go
on
to
sunch
'
ston
for
the
night
.
she
chatted
unconcernedly
,
now
with
one
guest
now
with
another
,
while
they
in
their
turn
chatted
unconcernedly
with
one
another
.
miss
la
frime
to
mrs
humdrum
:
"
you
know
how
he
got
his
professorship
?
no
?
i
thought
every
one
knew
that
.
the
question
the
candidates
had
to
answer
was
,
whether
it
was
wiser
during
a
long
stay
at
a
hotel
to
tip
the
servants
pretty
early
,
or
to
wait
till
the
stay
was
ended
.
all
the
other
candidates
took
one
side
or
the
other
,
and
argued
their
case
in
full
.
hanky
sent
in
three
lines
to
the
effect
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
would
be
to
promise
at
the
beginning
,
and
go
away
without
giving
.
the
king
,
with
whom
the
appointment
rested
,
was
so
much
pleased
with
this
answer
that
he
gave
hanky
the
professorship
without
so
much
as
looking
.
.
.
"
professor
gabb
to
mrs
humdrum
:
"
oh
no
,
i
can
assure
you
there
is
no
truth
in
it
.
what
happened
was
this
.
there
was
the
usual
crowd
,
and
the
people
cheered
professor
after
professor
,
as
he
stood
before
them
in
the
great
bridgeford
theatre
and
satisfied
them
that
a
lump
of
butter
which
had
been
put
into
his
mouth
would
not
melt
in
it
.
when
hanky
'
s
turn
came
he
was
taken
suddenly
unwell
,
and
had
to
leave
the
theatre
,
on
which
there
was
a
report
in
the
house
that
the
butter
had
melted
;
this
was
at
once
stopped
by
the
return
of
the
professor
.
another
piece
of
butter
was
put
into
his
mouth
,
and
on
being
taken
out
after
the
usual
time
,
was
found
to
shew
no
signs
of
having

"
miss
bawl
to
mr
principal
crank
:
"
the
manager
was
so
tall
,
you
know
,
and
then
there
was
that
little
mite
of
an
assistant
manager
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
it
was
so
funny
.
for
the
assistant
manager
'
s
voice
was
ever
so
much
louder
than
the
"
mrs
bawl
to
professor
gabb
:
"
live
for
art
!
if
i
had
to
choose
whether
i
would
lose
either
art
or
science
,
i
have
not
the
smallest
hesitation
in
saying
that
i
would
lose
"
the
mayor
and
dr
downie
:
"
that
you
are
to
be
canonised
at
the
close
of
the
year
along
with
professors
hanky
and
panky
?
"
"
i
believe
it
is
his
majesty
'
s
intention
that
the
professors
and
myself
are
to
head
the
list
of
the
sunchild
'
s
saints
,
but
we
have
all
of
us
got
to
"
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
,
buzz
,
buzz
,
buzz
,
over
the
whole
table
.
presently
yram
turned
to
hanky
and
said
:
"
by
the
way
,
professor
,
you
must
have
found
it
very
cold
up
at
the
statues
,
did
you
not
?
but
i
suppose
the
snow
is
all
gone
by
this
time
?
"
"
yes
,
it
was
cold
,
and
though
the
winter
'
s
snow
is
melted
,
there
had
been
a
recent
fall
.
strange
to
say
,
we
saw
fresh
footprints
in
it
,
as
of
some
one
who
had
come
up
from
the
other
side
.
but
thereon
hangs
a
tale
,
about
which
i
believe
i
should
say
nothing
.
"
"
then
say
nothing
,
my
dear
professor
,
"
said
yram
with
a
frank
smile
.
"
above
all
,
"
she
added
quietly
and
gravely
,
"
say
nothing
to
the
mayor
,
nor
to
my
son
,
till
after
sunday
.
even
a
whisper
of
some
one
coming
over
from
the
other
side
disquiets
them
,
and
they
have
enough
on
hand
for
the
moment
.
"
panky
,
who
had
been
growing
more
and
more
restive
at
his
friend
'
s
outspokenness
,
but
who
had
encouraged
it
more
than
once
by
vainly
trying
to
check
it
,
was
relieved
at
hearing
his
hostess
do
for
him
what
he
could
not
do
for
himself
.
as
for
yram
,
she
had
got
enough
out
of
the
professor
to
be
now
fully
dissatisfied
,
and
mentally
informed
them
that
they
might
leave
the
witness
-
box
.
during
the
rest
of
dinner
she
let
the
subject
of
their
adventure
severely
alone
.
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
dinner
was
never
going
to
end
;
but
in
the
course
of
time
it
did
so
,
and
presently
the
ladies
withdrew
.
as
they
were
entering
the
drawing
-
room
a
servant
told
her
that
her
son
had
been
found
more
easily
than
was
expected
,
and
was
now
in
his
own
room
dressing
.
"
tell
him
,
"
she
said
,
"
to
stay
there
till
i
come
,
which
i
will
do
directly
.
"
she
remained
for
a
few
minutes
with
her
guests
,
and
then
,
excusing
herself
quietly
to
mrs
humdrum
,
she
stepped
out
and
hastened
to
her
son
'
s
room
.
she
told
him
that
professors
hanky
and
panky
were
staying
in
the
house
,
and
that
during
dinner
they
had
told
her
something
he
ought
to
know
,
but
which
there
was
no
time
to
tell
him
until
her
guests
were
gone
.
"
i
had
rather
,
"
she
said
,
"
tell
you
about
it
before
you
see
the
professors
,
for
if
you
see
them
the
whole
thing
will
be
reopened
,
and
you
are
sure
to
let
them
see
how
much
more
there
is
in
it
than
they
suspect
.
i
want
everything
hushed
up
for
the
moment
;
do
not
,
therefore
,
join
us
.
have
dinner
sent
to
you
in
your
father
'
s
study
.
i
will
come
to
you
about
midnight
.
"
"
but
,
my
dear
mother
,
"
said
george
,
"
i
have
seen
panky
already
.
i
walked
down
with
him
a
good
long
way
this
afternoon
.
"
yram
had
not
expected
this
,
but
she
kept
her
countenance
.
"
how
did
you
know
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
he
was
professor
panky
?
did
he
tell
you
so
?
"
"
certainly
he
did
.
he
showed
me
his
permit
,
which
was
made
out
in
favour
of
professors
hanky
and
panky
,
or
either
of
them
.
he
said
hanky
had
been
unable
to
come
with
him
,
and
that
he
was
himself
professor
panky
.
"
yram
again
smiled
very
sweetly
.
"
then
,
my
dear
boy
,
"
she
said
,
"
i
am
all
the
more
anxious
that
you
should
not
see
him
now
.
see
nobody
but
the
servants
and
your
brothers
,
and
wait
till
i
can
enlighten
you
.
i
must
not
stay
another
moment
;
but
tell
me
this
much
,
have
you
seen
any
signs
of
poachers
lately
?
"
"
yes
;
there
were
three
last
night
.
"
"
in
what
part
of
the
preserves
?
"
her
son
described
the
place
.
"
you
are
sure
they
had
been
killing
quails
?
"
"
yes
,
and
eating
them
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
two
on
one
side
of
a
fire
they
had
lit
,
and
one
on
the
other
;
this
last
man
had
done
all
the
plucking
.
"
"
good
!
"
she
kissed
him
with
more
than
even
her
usual
tenderness
,
and
returned
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
she
was
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
with
mrs
humdrum
,
leaving
her
other
guests
to
her
daughters
and
to
themselves
.
mrs
humdrum
had
been
her
closest
friend
for
many
years
,
and
carried
more
weight
than
any
one
else
in
sunch
'
ston
,
except
,
perhaps
,
yram
herself
.
"
tell
him
everything
,
"
she
said
to
yram
at
the
close
of
their
conversation
;
"
we
all
dote
upon
him
;
trust
him
frankly
,
as
you
trusted
your
husband
before
you
let
him
marry
you
.
no
lies
,
no
reserve
,
no
tears
,
and
all
will
come
right
.
as
for
me
,
command
me
,
"
and
the
good
old
lady
rose
to
take
her
leave
with
as
kind
a
look
on
her
face
as
ever
irradiated
saint
or
angel
.
"
i
go
early
,
"
she
added
,
"
for
the
others
will
go
when
they
see
me
do
so
,
and
the
sooner
you
are
alone
the
better
.
"
by
half
an
hour
before
midnight
her
guests
had
gone
.
hanky
and
panky
were
given
to
understand
that
they
must
still
be
tired
,
and
had
better
go
to
bed
.
so
was
the
mayor
;
so
were
her
sons
and
daughters
,
except
of
course
george
,
who
was
waiting
for
her
with
some
anxiety
,
for
he
had
seen
that
she
had
something
serious
to
tell
him
.
then
she
went
down
into
the
study
.
her
son
embraced
her
as
she
entered
,
and
moved
an
easy
chair
for
her
,
but
she
would
not
have
it
.
"
no
;
i
will
have
an
upright
one
.
"
then
,
sitting
composedly
down
on
the
one
her
son
placed
for
her
,
she
said
-
"
and
now
to
business
.
but
let
me
first
tell
you
that
the
mayor
was
told
,
twenty
years
ago
,
all
the
more
important
part
of
what
you
will
now
hear
.
he
does
not
yet
know
what
has
happened
within
the
last
few
hours
,
but
either
you
or
i
will
tell
him
to
-
morrow
.
"
"
what
did
you
think
of
panky
?
"
"
i
could
not
make
him
out
.
if
he
had
not
been
a
bridgeford
professor
i
might
have
liked
him
;
but
you
know
how
we
all
of
us
distrust
those
people
.
"
"
where
did
you
meet
him
?
"
"
about
two
hours
lower
down
than
the
statues
.
"
"
at
what
o
'
clock
?
"
"
it
might
be
between
two
and
half
-
past
.
"
"
i
suppose
he
did
not
say
that
at
that
hour
he
was
in
bed
at
his
hotel
in
sunch
'
ston
.
hardly
!
tell
me
what
passed
between
you
.
"
"
he
had
his
permit
open
before
we
were
within
speaking
distance
.
i
think
he
feared
i
should
attack
him
without
making
sure
whether
he
was
a
foreign
devil
or
no
.
i
have
told
you
he
said
he
was
professor
panky
.
"
"
i
suppose
he
had
a
dark
complexion
and
black
hair
like
the
rest
of
us
?
"
"
dark
complexion
and
hair
purplish
rather
than
black
.
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
his
eyelashes
were
as
light
as
my
own
,
and
his
eyes
were
blue
like
mine
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
you
will
have
noticed
this
at
dinner
.
"
"
no
,
my
dear
,
i
did
not
,
and
i
think
i
should
have
done
so
if
it
had
been
there
to
notice
.
"
"
oh
,
but
it
was
so
indeed
.
"
"
perhaps
.
was
there
anything
strange
about
his
way
of
talking
?
"
"
a
little
about
his
grammar
,
but
these
bridgeford
professors
have
often
risen
from
the
ranks
.
his
pronunciation
was
nearly
like
yours
and
mine
.
"
"
was
his
manner
friendly
?
"
"
very
;
more
so
than
i
could
understand
at
first
.
i
had
not
,
however
,
been
with
him
long
before
i
saw
tears
in
his
eyes
,
and
when
i
asked
him
whether
he
was
in
distress
,
he
said
i
reminded
him
of
a
son
whom
he
had
lost
and
had
found
after
many
years
,
only
to
lose
him
almost
immediately
for
ever
.
hence
his
cordiality
towards
me
.
"
"
then
,
"
said
yram
half
hysterically
to
herself
,
"
he
knew
who
you
were
.
now
,
how
,
i
wonder
,
did
he
find
that
out
?
"
all
vestige
of
doubt
as
to
who
the
man
might
be
had
now
left
her
.
"
certainly
he
knew
who
i
was
.
he
spoke
about
you
more
than
once
,
and
wished
us
every
kind
of
prosperity
,
baring
his
head
reverently
as
he
spoke
.
"
"
poor
fellow
!
did
he
say
anything
about
higgs
?
"
"
a
good
deal
,
and
i
was
surprised
to
find
he
thought
about
it
all
much
as
we
do
.
but
when
i
said
that
if
i
could
go
down
into
the
hell
of
which
higgs
used
to
talk
to
you
while
he
was
in
prison
,
i
should
expect
to
find
him
in
its
hottest
fires
,
he
did
not
like
it
.
"
"
possibly
not
,
my
dear
.
did
you
tell
him
how
the
other
boys
,
when
you
were
at
school
,
used
sometimes
to
say
you
were
son
to
this
man
higgs
,
and
that
the
people
of
sunch
'
ston
used
to
say
so
also
,
till
the
mayor
trounced
two
or
three
people
so
roundly
that
they
held
their
tongues
for
the
future
?
"
"
not
all
that
,
but
i
said
that
silly
people
had
believed
me
to
be
the
sunchild
'
s
son
,
and
what
a
disgrace
i
should
hold
it
to
be
son
to
such
an
impostor
.
"
"
what
did
he
say
to
this
?
"
"
he
asked
whether
i
should
feel
the
disgrace
less
if
higgs
were
to
undo
the
mischief
he
had
caused
by
coming
back
and
shewing
himself
to
the
people
for
what
he
was
.
but
he
said
it
would
be
no
use
for
him
to
do
so
,
inasmuch
as
people
would
kill
him
but
would
not
believe
him
.
"
"
and
you
said
?
"
"
let
him
come
back
,
speak
out
,
and
chance
what
might
befall
him
.
in
that
case
,
i
should
honour
him
,
father
or
no
father
.
"
"
and
he
?
"
"
he
asked
if
that
would
be
a
bargain
;
and
when
i
said
it
would
,
he
grasped
me
warmly
by
the
hand
on
higgs
'
s
behalf
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
though
what
it
could
matter
to
him
passes
my
comprehension
.
"
"
but
he
saw
that
even
though
higgs
were
to
shew
himself
and
say
who
he
was
,
it
would
mean
death
to
himself
and
no
good
to
any
one
else
?
"
"
perfectly
.
"
"
then
he
can
have
meant
nothing
by
shaking
hands
with
you
.
it
was
an
idle
jest
.
and
now
for
your
poachers
.
you
do
not
know
who
they
were
?
i
will
tell
you
.
the
two
who
sat
on
the
one
side
the
fire
were
professors
hanky
and
panky
from
the
city
of
the
people
who
are
above
suspicion
.
"
"
no
,
"
said
george
vehemently
.
"
impossible
.
"
"
yes
,
my
dear
boy
,
quite
possible
,
and
whether
possible
or
impossible
,
assuredly
true
.
"
"
and
the
third
man
?
"
"
the
third
man
was
dressed
in
the
old
costume
.
he
was
in
possession
of
several
brace
of
birds
.
the
professors
vowed
they
had
not
eaten
any
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
oh
yes
,
but
they
had
,
"
blurted
out
george
.
"
of
course
they
had
,
my
dear
;
and
a
good
thing
too
.
let
us
return
to
the
man
in
the
old
costume
.
"
"
that
is
puzzling
.
who
did
he
say
he
was
?
"
"
he
said
he
was
one
of
your
men
;
that
you
had
instructed
him
to
provide
you
with
three
dozen
quails
for
sunday
;
and
that
you
let
your
men
wear
the
old
costume
if
they
had
any
of
it
left
,
provided
-
-
"
this
was
too
much
for
george
;
he
started
to
his
feet
.
"
what
,
my
dearest
mother
,
does
all
this
mean
?
you
have
been
playing
with
me
all
through
.
what
is
coming
?
"
"
a
very
little
more
,
and
you
shall
hear
.
this
man
staid
with
the
professors
till
nearly
midnight
,
and
then
left
them
on
the
plea
that
he
would
finish
the
night
in
the
ranger
'
s
shelter
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
ranger
'
s
shelter
,
indeed
!
why
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
hush
,
my
darling
boy
,
be
patient
with
me
.
he
said
he
must
be
up
betimes
,
to
run
down
the
rest
of
the
quails
you
had
ordered
him
to
bring
you
.
but
before
leaving
the
professors
he
beguiled
them
into
giving
him
up
their
permit
.
"
"
then
,
said
george
,
striding
about
the
room
with
his
face
flushed
and
his
eyes
flashing
,
"
he
was
the
man
with
whom
i
walked
down
this
afternoon
.
"
"
exactly
so
.
"
"
and
he
must
have
changed
his
dress
?
"
"
exactly
so
.
"
"
but
where
and
how
?
"
"
at
some
place
not
very
far
down
on
the
other
side
the
range
,
where
he
had
hidden
his
old
clothes
.
"
"
and
who
,
in
the
name
of
all
that
we
hold
most
sacred
,
do
you
take
him
to
have
been
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
i
see
you
know
more
than
you
have
yet
told
me
?
"
"
my
son
,
he
was
higgs
the
sunchild
,
father
to
that
boy
whom
i
love
next
to
my
husband
more
dearly
than
any
one
in
the
whole
world
.
"
she
folded
her
arms
about
him
for
a
second
,
without
kissing
him
,
and
left
him
.
"
and
now
,
"
she
said
,
the
moment
she
had
closed
the
door
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
and
now
i
may
cry
.
"
she
did
not
cry
for
long
,
and
having
removed
all
trace
of
tears
as
far
as
might
be
,
she
returned
to
her
son
outwardly
composed
and
cheerful
.
"
shall
i
say
more
now
,
"
she
said
,
seeing
how
grave
he
looked
,
"
or
shall
i
leave
you
,
and
talk
further
with
you
to
-
morrow
?
"
"
now
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
now
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
now
!
"
"
good
!
a
little
before
higgs
came
here
,
the
mayor
,
as
he
now
is
,
poor
,
handsome
,
generous
to
a
fault
so
far
as
he
had
the
wherewithal
,
was
adored
by
all
the
women
of
his
own
rank
in
sunch
'
ston
.
report
said
that
he
had
adored
many
of
them
in
return
,
but
after
having
known
me
for
a
very
few
days
,
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
,
protesting
that
he
was
a
changed
man
.
i
liked
him
,
as
every
one
else
did
,
but
i
was
not
in
love
with
him
,
and
said
so
;
he
said
he
would
give
me
as
much
time
as
i
chose
,
if
i
would
not
point
-
blank
refuse
him
;
and
so
the
matter
was
left
.
"
within
a
week
or
so
higgs
was
brought
to
the
prison
,
and
he
had
not
been
there
long
before
i
found
,
or
thought
i
found
,
that
i
liked
him
better
than
i
liked
strong
.
i
was
a
fool
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
there
!
as
for
higgs
,
he
liked
,
but
did
not
love
me
.
if
i
had
let
him
alone
he
would
have
done
the
like
by
me
;
and
let
each
other
alone
we
did
,
till
the
day
before
he
was
taken
down
to
the
capital
.
on
that
day
,
whether
through
his
fault
or
mine
i
know
not
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
we
neither
of
us
meant
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
it
was
as
though
nature
,
my
dear
,
was
determined
that
you
should
not
slip
through
her
fingers
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
well
,
on
that
day
we
took
it
into
our
heads
that
we
were
broken
-
hearted
lovers
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
rest
followed
.
and
how
,
my
dearest
boy
,
as
i
look
upon
you
,
can
i
feign
repentance
?
"
my
husband
,
who
never
saw
higgs
,
and
knew
nothing
about
him
except
the
too
little
that
i
told
him
,
pressed
his
suit
,
and
about
a
month
after
higgs
had
gone
,
having
recovered
my
passing
infatuation
for
him
,
i
took
kindly
to
the
mayor
and
accepted
him
,
without
telling
him
what
i
ought
to
have
told
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
the
words
stuck
in
my
throat
.
i
had
not
been
engaged
to
him
many
days
before
i
found
that
there
was
something
which
i
should
not
be
able
to
hide
much
longer
.
"
you
know
,
my
dear
,
that
my
mother
had
been
long
dead
,
and
i
never
had
a
sister
or
any
near
kinswoman
.
at
my
wits
'
end
who
i
should
consult
,
instinct
drew
me
to
mrs
humdrum
,
then
a
woman
of
about
five
-
and
-
forty
.
she
was
a
grand
lady
,
while
i
was
about
the
rank
of
one
of
my
own
housemaids
.
i
had
no
claim
on
her
;
i
went
to
her
as
a
lost
dog
looks
into
the
faces
of
people
on
a
road
,
and
singles
out
the
one
who
will
most
surely
help
him
.
i
had
had
a
good
look
at
her
once
as
she
was
putting
on
her
gloves
,
and
i
liked
the
way
she
did
it
.
i
marvel
at
my
own
boldness
.
at
any
rate
,
i
asked
to
see
her
,
and
told
her
my
story
exactly
as
i
have
now
told
it
to
you
.
"
'
you
have
no
mother
?
'
she
said
,
when
she
had
heard
all
.
"
'
no
.
'
"
'
then
,
my
dear
,
i
will
mother
you
myself
.
higgs
is
out
of
the
question
,
so
strong
must
marry
you
at
once
.
we
will
tell
him
everything
,
and
i
,
on
your
behalf
,
will
insist
upon
it
that
the
engagement
is
at
an
end
.
i
hear
good
reports
of
him
,
and
if
we
are
fair
towards
him
he
will
be
generous
towards
us
.
besides
,
i
believe
he
is
so
much
in
love
with
you
that
he
would
sell
his
soul
to
get
you
.
send
him
to
me
.
i
can
deal
with
him
better
than
you
can
.
'
"
"
and
what
,
"
said
george
,
"
did
my
father
,
as
i
shall
always
call
him
,
say
to
all
this
?
"
truth
bred
chivalry
in
him
at
once
.
'
i
will
marry
her
,
'
he
said
,
with
hardly
a
moment
'
s
hesitation
,
'
but
it
will
be
better
that
i
should
not
be
put
on
any
lower
footing
than
higgs
was
.
i
ought
not
to
be
denied
anything
that
has
been
allowed
to
him
.
if
i
am
trusted
,
i
can
trust
myself
to
trust
and
think
no
evil
either
of
higgs
or
her
.
they
were
pestered
beyond
endurance
,
as
i
have
been
ere
now
.
if
i
am
held
at
arm
'
s
length
till
i
am
fast
bound
,
i
shall
marry
yram
just
the
same
,
but
i
doubt
whether
she
and
i
shall
ever
be
quite
happy
.
'
"
'
come
to
my
house
this
evening
,
'
said
mrs
humdrum
,
'
and
you
will
find
yram
there
.
'
he
came
,
he
found
me
,
and
within
a
fortnight
we
were
man
and
wife
.
"
"
how
much
does
not
all
this
explain
,
"
said
george
,
smiling
but
very
gravely
.
"
and
you
are
going
to
ask
me
to
forgive
you
for
robbing
me
of
such
a
father
.
"
"
he
has
forgiven
me
,
my
dear
,
for
robbing
him
of
such
a
son
.
he
never
reproached
me
.
from
that
day
to
this
he
has
never
given
me
a
harsh
word
or
even
syllable
.
when
you
were
born
he
took
to
you
at
once
,
as
,
indeed
,
who
could
help
doing
?
for
you
were
the
sweetest
child
both
in
looks
and
temper
that
it
is
possible
to
conceive
.
your
having
light
hair
and
eyes
made
things
more
difficult
;
for
this
,
and
your
being
born
,
almost
to
the
day
,
nine
months
after
higgs
had
left
us
,
made
people
talk
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
your
father
kept
their
tongues
within
bounds
.
they
talk
still
,
but
they
liked
what
little
they
saw
of
higgs
,
they
like
the
mayor
and
me
,
and
they
like
you
the
best
of
all
;
so
they
please
themselves
by
having
the
thing
both
ways
.
though
,
therefore
,
you
are
son
to
the
mayor
,
higgs
cast
some
miraculous
spell
upon
me
before
he
left
,
whereby
my
son
should
be
in
some
measure
his
as
well
as
the
mayor
'
s
.
it
was
this
miraculous
spell
that
caused
you
to
be
born
two
months
too
soon
,
and
we
called
you
by
higgs
'
s
first
name
as
though
to
show
that
we
took
that
view
of
the
matter
ourselves
.
"
mrs
.
humdrum
,
however
,
was
very
positive
that
there
was
no
spell
at
all
.
she
had
repeatedly
heard
her
father
say
that
the
mayor
'
s
grandfather
was
light
-
haired
and
blue
-
eyed
,
and
that
every
third
generation
in
that
family
a
light
-
haired
son
was
born
.
the
people
believe
this
too
.
nobody
disbelieves
mrs
humdrum
,
but
they
like
the
miracle
best
,
so
that
is
how
it
has
been
settled
.
"
i
never
knew
whether
mrs
humdrum
told
her
husband
,
but
i
think
she
must
;
for
a
place
was
found
almost
immediately
for
my
husband
in
mr
humdrum
'
s
business
.
he
made
himself
useful
;
after
a
few
years
he
was
taken
into
partnership
,
and
on
mr
humdrum
'
s
death
became
head
of
the
firm
.
between
ourselves
,
he
says
laughingly
that
all
his
success
in
life
was
due
to
higgs
and
me
.
"
"
i
shall
give
mrs
humdrum
a
double
dose
of
kissing
,
"
said
george
thoughtfully
,
"
next
time
i
see
her
.
"
"
oh
,
do
,
do
;
she
will
so
like
it
.
and
now
,
my
darling
boy
,
tell
your
poor
mother
whether
or
no
you
can
forgive
her
.
"
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
,
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
,
but
for
a
time
he
could
find
no
utterance
.
presently
he
smiled
,
and
said
,
"
of
course
i
do
,
but
it
is
you
who
should
forgive
me
,
for
was
it
not
all
my
fault
?
"
when
yram
,
too
,
had
become
more
calm
,
she
said
,
"
it
is
late
,
and
we
have
no
time
to
lose
.
higgs
'
s
coming
at
this
time
is
mere
accident
;
if
he
had
had
news
from
erewhon
he
would
have
known
much
that
he
did
not
know
.
i
cannot
guess
why
he
has
come
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
probably
through
mere
curiosity
,
but
he
will
hear
or
have
heard
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
yes
,
you
and
he
talked
about
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
of
the
temple
;
being
here
,
he
will
want
to
see
the
dedication
.
from
what
you
have
told
me
i
feel
sure
that
he
will
not
make
a
fool
of
himself
by
saying
who
he
is
,
but
in
spite
of
his
disguise
he
may
be
recognised
.
i
do
not
doubt
that
he
is
now
in
sunch
'
ston
;
therefore
,
to
-
morrow
morning
scour
the
town
to
find
him
.
tell
him
he
is
discovered
,
tell
him
you
know
from
me
that
he
is
your
father
,
and
that
i
wish
to
see
him
with
all
good
-
will
towards
him
.
he
will
come
.
we
will
then
talk
to
him
,
and
show
him
that
he
must
go
back
at
once
.
you
can
escort
him
to
the
statues
;
after
passing
them
he
will
be
safe
.
he
will
give
you
no
trouble
,
but
if
he
does
,
arrest
him
on
a
charge
of
poaching
,
and
take
him
to
the
gaol
,
where
we
must
do
the
best
we
can
with
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
he
will
give
you
none
.
we
need
say
nothing
to
the
professors
.
no
one
but
ourselves
will
know
of
his
having
been
here
.
"
on
this
she
again
embraced
her
son
and
left
him
.
if
two
photographs
could
have
been
taken
of
her
,
one
as
she
opened
the
door
and
looked
fondly
back
on
george
,
and
the
other
as
she
closed
it
behind
her
,
the
second
portrait
would
have
seemed
taken
ten
years
later
than
the
first
.
as
for
george
,
he
went
gravely
but
not
unhappily
to
his
own
room
.
"
so
that
ready
,
plausible
fellow
,
"
he
muttered
to
himself
,
"
was
my
own
father
.
at
any
rate
,
i
am
not
son
to
a
fool
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
he
liked
me
.
"
i
will
now
return
to
my
father
.
whether
from
fatigue
or
over
-
excitement
,
he
slept
only
by
fits
and
starts
,
and
when
awake
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
idea
that
,
in
spite
of
his
disguise
,
he
might
be
recognised
,
either
at
his
inn
or
in
the
town
,
by
some
one
of
the
many
who
had
seen
him
when
he
was
in
prison
.
in
this
case
there
was
no
knowing
what
might
happen
,
but
at
best
,
discovery
would
probably
prevent
his
seeing
the
temple
dedicated
to
himself
,
and
hearing
professor
hanky
'
s
sermon
,
which
he
was
particularly
anxious
to
do
.
so
strongly
did
he
feel
the
real
or
fancied
danger
he
should
incur
by
spending
saturday
in
sunch
'
ston
,
that
he
rose
as
soon
as
he
heard
any
one
stirring
,
and
having
paid
his
bill
,
walked
quietly
out
of
the
house
,
without
saying
where
he
was
going
.
there
was
a
town
about
ten
miles
off
,
not
so
important
as
sunch
'
ston
,
but
having
some
10
,
000
inhabitants
;
he
resolved
to
find
accommodation
there
for
the
day
and
night
,
and
to
walk
over
to
sunch
'
ston
in
time
for
the
dedication
ceremony
,
which
he
had
found
on
inquiry
,
would
begin
at
eleven
o
'
clock
.
the
country
between
sunch
'
ston
and
fairmead
,
as
the
town
just
referred
to
was
named
,
was
still
mountainous
,
and
being
well
wooded
as
well
as
well
watered
,
abounded
in
views
of
singular
beauty
;
but
i
have
no
time
to
dwell
on
the
enthusiasm
with
which
my
father
described
them
to
me
.
the
road
took
him
at
right
angles
to
the
main
road
down
the
valley
from
sunch
'
ston
to
the
capital
,
and
this
was
one
reason
why
he
had
chosen
fairmead
rather
than
clearwater
,
which
was
the
next
town
lower
down
on
the
main
road
.
he
did
not
,
indeed
,
anticipate
that
any
one
would
want
to
find
him
,
but
whoever
might
so
want
would
be
more
likely
to
go
straight
down
the
valley
than
to
turn
aside
towards
fairmead
.
on
reaching
this
place
,
he
found
it
pretty
full
of
people
,
for
saturday
was
market
-
day
.
there
was
a
considerable
open
space
in
the
middle
of
the
town
,
with
an
arcade
running
round
three
sides
of
it
,
while
the
fourth
was
completely
taken
up
by
the
venerable
musical
bank
of
the
city
,
a
building
which
had
weathered
the
storms
of
more
than
five
centuries
.
on
the
outside
of
the
wall
,
abutting
on
the
market
-
place
,
were
three
wooden
sedilia
,
in
which
the
mayor
and
two
coadjutors
sate
weekly
on
market
-
days
to
give
advice
,
redress
grievances
,
and
,
if
necessary
(
which
it
very
seldom
was
)
to
administer
correction
.
my
father
was
much
interested
in
watching
the
proceedings
in
a
case
which
he
found
on
inquiry
to
be
not
infrequent
.
a
man
was
complaining
to
the
mayor
that
his
daughter
,
a
lovely
child
of
eight
years
old
,
had
none
of
the
faults
common
to
children
of
her
age
,
and
,
in
fact
,
seemed
absolutely
deficient
in
immoral
sense
.
she
never
told
lies
,
had
never
stolen
so
much
as
a
lollipop
,
never
showed
any
recalcitrancy
about
saying
her
prayers
,
and
by
her
incessant
obedience
had
filled
her
poor
father
and
mother
with
the
gravest
anxiety
as
regards
her
future
well
-
being
.
he
feared
it
would
be
necessary
to
send
her
to
a
deformatory
.
"
i
have
generally
found
,
"
said
the
mayor
,
gravely
but
kindly
,
"
that
the
fault
in
these
distressing
cases
lies
rather
with
the
parent
than
the
children
.
does
the
child
never
break
anything
by
accident
?
"
"
yes
,
"
said
the
father
.
"
and
you
have
duly
punished
her
for
it
?
"
"
alas
!
sir
,
i
fear
i
only
told
her
she
was
a
naughty
girl
,
and
must
not
do
it
again
.
"
"
then
how
can
you
expect
your
child
to
learn
those
petty
arts
of
deception
without
which
she
must
fall
an
easy
prey
to
any
one
who
wishes
to
deceive
her
?
how
can
she
detect
lying
in
other
people
unless
she
has
had
some
experience
of
it
in
her
own
practice
?
how
,
again
,
can
she
learn
when
it
will
be
well
for
her
to
lie
,
and
when
to
refrain
from
doing
so
,
unless
she
has
made
many
a
mistake
on
a
small
scale
while
at
an
age
when
mistakes
do
not
greatly
matter
?
the
sunchild
(
and
here
he
reverently
raised
his
hat
)
,
as
you
may
read
in
chapter
thirty
-
one
of
his
sayings
,
has
left
us
a
touching
tale
of
a
little
boy
,
who
,
having
cut
down
an
apple
tree
in
his
father
'
s
garden
,
lamented
his
inability
to
tell
a
lie
.
some
commentators
,
indeed
,
have
held
that
the
evidence
was
so
strongly
against
the
boy
that
no
lie
would
have
been
of
any
use
to
him
,
and
that
his
perception
of
this
fact
was
all
that
he
intended
to
convey
;
but
the
best
authorities
take
his
simple
words
,
'
i
cannot
tell
a
