Much of the coverage of last week's pensions bill focused on winners and losers. We at the Institute for Fiscal Studies have pointed out that nearly everyone – other than the self-employed – retiring after about 2040 will be made worse off. 
 It's nice to know who will be affected. But this bill represents something much deeper and more interesting about the development of pension policy. It is the culmination of decades of change and the undoing of what looks in retrospect to have been a major policy dead end. And it is confirmation of the end of any serious link between contributions into our supposed social insurance system and benefits received. 
 Understanding the tortuous journey that has brought us to last week's bill can help us learn an awful lot about how to make policy and how not to make policy. This bill finally lays to rest the legacy of Serps – the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. Serps was introduced in 1978 and has been gradually picked apart by a succession of reforms ever since. It was a generous scheme, offering people a quarter of the salary they earned during the highest earning 20 years of their working lives. With an ageing population, those costs would have been huge. Lesson number one: don't make policy without a serious focus on long-term sustainability. 
 The concept of "fairness", which underlies Serps – that benefits should in some sense reflect contributions – has changed over time. The new proposals encapsulate a different idea of fairness: that everyone is entitled to a basic income in retirement irrespective of contribution. The new system will be much more redistributive from rich to poor. It ends any notion that what you get out should reflect what you put in. Lesson number two: policy may not be robust in the long run if ideas of fairness change. 
 Beveridge always intended his system to pay pensions only to those who had paid contributions. First for the basic pension, and then for Serps and its successor, the state second pension, increasing numbers of non-workers – carers, unemployed people, women looking after children, sick and disabled people – were "credited in". This bill retrospectively brings in the self-employed and also increases rights for women who took time out of the labour market. Lesson number three: social insurance systems always end up with wider coverage than originally intended. 
 We have also lost earnings-related pensions because the existing system is not understood. Few people have any idea how the earnings-related element works. Lesson number four: over-complex policies are not robust. 
 We are coming close to the end of a long policy journey. But we are not at the end of the pensions journey. Policy on private provision has taken us to a very uncomfortable place in which too many individuals are exposed to too much risk. We have finally got a clear state building block – a flat-rate pension. We now need to reassess the private edifice built on top.
