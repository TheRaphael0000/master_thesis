I am a man from south London, 22 years of age and determined to make a change. I've had a very shady history and my addiction almost destroyed my life. It saw me under-achieving in school, it perverted my moral compass, it resulted in the deaths of many of my peers, and the list goes on. You've probably put me in the bracket of a former drug addict, or an alcoholic. 
 But my addiction was to gang culture. And like so many addictions it started out as nothing more than a pastime: recreational, it was a way to socialise with other boys. It started fairly innocently, throwing eggs at windows and playing knock down ginger, then progressed to shootings, gang rivalry and dealing drugs. I know that sounds a big jump, and I'm not for a second saying that everyone who throws a few eggs will grow up to become a gang member. I'm just trying to illustrate how innocently it starts for so many, including myself. 
 By 18, I was addicted to the lifestyle of being a gangster. The money, the power and the status it gave me among young men on my estate in Brixton. The downside was that I had been shot at more times than I've had birthday parties, I'd been cut on my face, almost blinded, and butchered in my back. I was living life every day with a pool of negative ambition perverting my potential. My prospects were getting bleaker and bleaker, until a courageous woman on my estate whose son was also a member of my gang opened her home to me and several others who were caught in the net she called gangsterism. 
 Her name was Pastor Mimi and she ran a local church in the area. She never condemned us. She acknowledged that we were lost children who needed direction. Her home became our refuge; she would engage with us, counsel us, and helped us to identify that our true enemy was not our rivals from another estate but the ideology of gangsterism. This did not happen overnight. It took, time, effort, love and a strategy. She sparked a small flame of change in us that she fanned over a two-year period by challenging and dethroning the notion of gangsterism in our minds. The six of us who lived in the house and underwent her treatment have all been reformed. We are trying to help others in our community who are where we've been. In doing so, we're becoming assets, not liabilities, to society. 
 For some that would be the happy ending, but for us it is only the beginning. There are clinics for rehabilitating drug addicts, alcoholics, and even sex addictions. Like any addiction, those who are addicted can see that the lifestyle they are leading is self-destructing but are almost powerless to change their circumstances. We now possess a formula that has been proven to help young men who are addicted to being in gangs. 
 The rehabilitation model developed by Pastor Mimi is that of a therapeutic community rehabilitation centre. It is a unique and effective way of dealing with gangs. The police are doing their job arresting gang members who break the law but gang-related crime is still a major issue because the ideology remains unchallenged. So much taxpayers' money is used to incarcerate youths convicted of gang-related crimes. But prison is not the solution. A fraction of the money spent on detaining young people for gang crime could be used instead to set up a centre to rehabilitate them by mirroring the process I underwent under Pastor Mimi's roof. 
 On Wednesday night, Pastor Mimi and I are taking the first step to setting up the first gang rehabilitation centre in the UK. I was chosen as the August winner of Ideas for London , an Artangel competition in association with the London Evening Standard, which has given me the opportunity to host a dinner with politicians, community leaders and youth justice experts in order to put together a plan of action. A gang rehabilitation centre is a necessary and overdue step towards ending the epidemic of gangs on our streets.
