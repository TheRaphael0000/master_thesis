Amid all the changes brought by the coalition government the decision to bring in welfare reform, alongside changes to social rents, and, in particular, the advent of "affordable rents ", seems one of the most misguided. 
 The affordable rent model encourages social landlords to charge new tenants up to 80% of the market rent, rewarding them for doing so with a grant from the Homes and Communities Agency. 
 In Islington, the north London borough where I live, the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom flat in the social sector is about £400. An increase to 80% market rent would take this to about £1,200, well beyond the reach of anyone on a low, or even average, income, and force out those on benefits because of the benefit cap (even where social landlords have set affordable rent at 65% of market rates the difference is onerous). 
 Those in the private rented sector will also have to move because it is all but impossible to rent within a benefit cap that makes no allowance for the drastically different market rents across the country. 
 Of course, many will think this only fair. Many will question why taxpayers' money should be spent subsidising rent they themselves could not afford. Which is understandable in a way. Except that the money is not going to the tenants at all, but rather into landlords' pockets. 
 Presumably we can all agree that people need to live somewhere. Even the inconvenient people such as the long-term sick, the unemployed and those infuriating people who go to work but still don't earn enough to pay the rent; they've all got to live somewhere. 
 It seems what the government has in mind is the sort of model the developing world is trying to develop away from: namely, shantytowns on the outskirts of cities. You think I'm exaggerating? I hope I am. La Canada Real , to the south of Madrid, is Europe's largest slum. Home to 30,000 people, it is completely devoid of public services, including schools and sanitation. And it is just a 15-minute drive from the city centre. 
 How is this possible? When people start seeing each other not as individuals but as types, and as troublesome types at that – skivers and scroungers, to use the government's favoured rhetoric. It is much easier then to ship them out to somewhere we won't bump into them at the corner shop (buying alcohol!) or walk past their still-closed curtains in the morning. 
 And without the individual encounters that cut across prejudice – the chat with a fellow dog-walker, with a teenage mum at a toddler group, with the immigrant family living next door – if all we have left are the outside labels and none of the human particulars, why should anyone question the divide between those who deserve a decent standard of living and those who do not (well, they've only themselves to blame)? 
 A healthy society is diverse, not divided. Islington is extremely diverse, with more than 100 languages spoken in the borough's primary schools. Some of the wealthiest people in London live here, as do some of the nation's poorest. The gap is certainly unhealthily wide but to seek to narrow it by evicting the poor is ethically unacceptable, and inadvisable even in purely economic terms. 
 Writing people off will cost us far more in the long run than finding creative, intelligent ways to help people thrive in a diverse and fluid society. Thankfully, Islington council agrees. It has refused to sign up to "affordable" rent on the grounds that it would be "unaffordable to Islington tenants". It is the only London borough so far to do so. Let's hope others follow suit.
