The closure of Kids Company is going to be unimaginably painful for the thousands of children who relied on it. I was a teenage domestic abuse survivor and grew up knowing family dysfunction. I know what it’s like to suffer in silence. I understand how something as simple as a youth club can change your week. How the care from one wonderful youth or community worker can inspire you to keep going, be the light in a dark week, the joy in an unhappy day and an invaluable source of strength. 
 I also know how hard it is to close the door on something this special. Up until last year, I ran a charity in the north-east of England called A Way Out. It was set up in 2002 to help vulnerable children and young women who were at risk of addiction and sexual exploitation. We provided drop-in centres, youth clubs, creative programmes, counselling, therapies, meals and mentoring. From the beginning, we knew we needed to be more than just a professional service: we needed to offer friendship, love and hope. We also needed to be there for the long haul. A journey to wholeness for a child or young woman could take years. The abuse they’d endured and the subsequent psychological damage, didn’t happen overnight and neither would change. Addiction was commonplace, as was self-harm, eating disorders, homelessness and family breakdown. We needed to help people rebuild their lives piece by piece. 
 Most funders knew that this couldn’t be a short-term activity, although some didn’t. Government funding was often the hardest to come by and civil servants the least easy to explain our model to and justify how and why it worked. 
 When I first heard Camila Batmanghelidjh speak, I wanted to give her a standing ovation. She had a model not dissimilar to ours, but she had statistical, evidence-based research to back up her theory – and she was getting funding. I was keen to know more. Over the years my staff and I visited Kids Company. We also attended some of its training and conferences and I followed the charity’s journey with interest. 
 It’s a tragedy that it has had to close. Kids Company wasn’t an ordinary children’s service. The children who turned up at its door may never have been to a beach, never eaten in a restaurant, never known what it was like to be cared for by someone who didn’t want something in return or didn’t try to abuse you. It can take years to build the therapeutic trust needed for change. You become more than a weekly appointment or monthly assessment. You become family and you become hope. How can you close the door on hope? 
 A Way Out’s doors have fortunately remained open throughout this time of austerity, but some of its services have had to be cut over the years. We had to close a young women’s preventive service, some of our community-based youth programmes and health interventions. It’s the worst thing you have to do. You can make contingency plans, but you know that for that group of vulnerable people who have relied on you, you’re doing what most people have done throughout their lives – you’re letting them down. It’s unbelievably damaging. This is why it’s going to be so difficult for another service to pick up where Kids Company left off. 
 If there is any way to save at least some of its services, then we must continue to look at the possibilities. We must learn lessons from what went wrong, but also from what went right. Kids Company changed the lives of thousands of children. We must remember and keep hold of that. For those involved in the delivery or funding of services to children, it’s important to understand that care takes time and change takes compassion. It also takes finance. 
 Thousands of children are now in need of resources, community, hope and love. Local government, community organisations, faith groups and charities need to step into the breach left by Kids Company’s closure. 
 We also need systemic change. There are too many children suffering across our nation and yet their voices are not being heard. They may not have a vote, but we must make sure they have a voice. The cuts the government is making hurt children more than any other group. How can we call this “Great” Britain, when our most vulnerable citizens, our children, are being neglected and ignored? We must campaign to make children a political priority. Use the #Iseethechild hashtag to tell the government how you feel. Organise a local demonstration. Write to your MP, and most of all,Let’s make sure that Kids Company’s legacy continues – that all children will be seen and heard.
