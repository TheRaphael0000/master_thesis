Think fuel poverty’s not on your doorstep? Think again. Around 2.3 million UK households can’t afford to keep their home adequately heated. Every year 25,000 older people die as a result of living in a cold home – one person aged over 65 every seven minutes. 
 Fuel poverty is a complex issue, full of misconceptions. 
 First, many mistakenly believe everyone living in fuel poverty is on benefits. In fact, a study last winter found that half of households living in fuel poverty in the UK had someone in work. A fuel-poor home is the result of a combination of the household income being below the poverty line, and a property having higher than typical energy costs. So insulation – or a lack of – has just as much impact on the expense of keeping warm. The UK’s housing stock is among the least energy-efficient in Europe. People in steady jobs, with modest incomes, living in poorly insulated properties, are spending a large proportion of their income heating their home. 
Second, fuel poverty doesn’t just affect pensioners. Heating a poorly insulated house adequately for a small child is expensive. A report by the Association for the Conservation of Energy estimated that, in 2013, there were at least 1.5 million children in the UK living in fuel poverty. With the government’s planned tax credit cuts, the possibility of plunging more children in already struggling families into a much more serious situation this winter is very real. 
 Third, while fuel poverty in cities tends to be visible, it doesn’t just affect urban areas. Fuel poverty is often more acute in off-gas-grid rural areas , where household energy bills are on average 27% higher. Again, energy-inefficient homes play a big role. Many houses in rural areas were built years ago for labourers and have low, or no, insulation. 
 But the most important battle we’re facing is the misconception that the fuel poverty crisis in the UK cannot be fixed. It is scandalous that in 2015 so many people can’t heat their homes to an adequate standard. 
 Energy prices are at historically low levels. We should be using this breathing space to evaluate and radically improve the UK’s existing housing stock before energy prices rise again. 
 The new National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) should make this an immediate priority. As a report by the economic consultancy Frontier Economics argues, not only is energy efficiency a form of infrastructure but, by the governments’ own figures, it offers greater benefits than the HS2 rail programme. 
 It’s time to tackle fuel poverty head on.
