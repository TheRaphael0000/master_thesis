Last night, five public leaders gathered to find out which of them had won this year's Leadership Excellence award at the Guardian's annual Public Services Awards. Those who make it to this prestigious shortlist are already, of course, outstanding public leaders. 
 But those on this year's shortlist – Mike Bracken, who runs the government's digital programme; Sue Bruce, who runs Edinburgh city council; Carl Haggerty, head of digital communications at Devon county council; Lynne Owens, chief constable of Surrey police; and Keir Starmer, who has just finished a five-year stint as director of public prosecutions – all stand out for extra reasons. 
 All five highlight how public leadership is changing. The civil service reform plan said more skills were needed in operations, project management, finance and digital, so public leadership is becoming much more focused on delivery and taking a more individual approach to achieve it. The X-factor that our shortlist display is an often elusive leadership quality – using an individual style to get stuff done. These are not "cookie-cutter" leaders. 
 Bracken, for instance, who joined the government from the Guardian , is described as a "Marmite" figure – people love him or hate him. He's most certainly nothing like the stereotype of a civil servant. He's brash, he didn't go to Oxbridge and last year he was 13th in Wired Magazine's top 100 digital power influencers. 
 Similarly, Owens is seen as a leader who stamps her own mark on the job of running a police force. 
 The award-winning leader, Devon county council's Haggerty, was cited for his energy and openness in building digital engagement and innovation in rural south-west England. 
 Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, said at a recent open government conference that transparency isn't just a "feelgood accessory" for leadership. Neither is diversity. It's no surprise that two of our five shorlisted candidates are women. Diversity is important for leadership to ensure that the net is cast as wide as possible, to get the best, most capable people running public services. 
 A sign of this was the recent appointment of Sharon White as second permanent secretary in the Treasury. White is a woman with young children. She is black and in her early 40s, relatively young for such a senior role. Her appointment made the headlines. The former Conservative chancellor, Ken Clarke, who worked with White in the early 90s and was said to be a big fan, got it nearly right when he told the BBC that White hadn't been appointed because she ticked boxes. "Actually she's able," he said. "It's a bonus extra, that she ticks all those boxes." 
 Actually, it is precisely because White ticks the boxes that she is so able. She brings a different perspective because she comes from a different background and has worked in different organisations, not just the Treasury, and not just the civil service. 
 There are still not enough women, disabled people or people from ethnic minorities at the top of the civil service. The aim is for 34% of senior civil service managers to be women by March 2014 – up from 30% last year. That's double the rate of FTSE 100 companies. 
 At the very top, however, even with White's appointment, of the 41 most senior jobs at permanent secretary level, nine – not even a quarter – are held by women. 
 Individual appointments do matter, though. Jill Rutter, programme director at the Institute for Government thinktank, noted that White's appointment sends "a signal to other people in the civil service that this is a place where women can succeed, that people with family responsibilities can succeed and black people can get to the top".
