The coalition wielded the axe on housing benefit in its first few weeks, and I wrote then on these pages that the upshot in London would be the class equivalent of ethnic cleansing. Two years on, and we are starting to witness how this plays out in practice. 
 It is not new for pricey boroughs in the metropolis to shunt families presenting as homeless in an outwardly or easterly direction. But last week we learned of shunting on an entirely different scale – and from London's traditionally cheaper eastern edge. A letter from Newham council sounded out a housing association in Stoke-on-Trent about prospective relocations, and found its way into the press. Then, letters to families in neighbouring Waltham Forest emerged, which made a take-it-or-leave-it offer of a home in Walsall in the West Midlands, 130 miles away. 
 The Today programme carried a moving interview with a recently widowed mother who had got such a letter, and was worried about her daughter being pulled out of a school she loved and ripped away from extended family. Soon enough, the story descended into a blame game. Housing minister Grant Shapps lashed out at Newham for taking drastic measures when there was no need and then hyping them up for political reasons. The Labour councils involved would surely have rather avoided the dire publicity, but once they were dragged into the limelight they raged at Whitehall over housing benefit cuts. 
 But what, I wondered, could the families getting these letters actually do? Sure, a few may fancy any alternative to a small flat in the big smoke, but this is no matter of choice. Most recipients will balk at the loss of family and social connections. All the research says these things are crucial for mental health and employment prospects, and that is even before considering the educational disruption for children. 
 Housing barrister Liz Davies talked me through the limited options someone has when a council tries to discharge its duties to house them 100 miles from home. "You generally have the right to an internal review by an officer of the same council that sent you the letter," she said. "Should that fail, you can try to go to the county court, but the court can only strike down the council's decision if the council has erred technically, by misinterpreting the law, no matter how heart-wrenching the circumstances may be." 
 The criteria are harsh – a forced move of schools, for instance, will not ordinarily necessitate a rethink. What's worse is that anyone who hastily rejects the offer can find themselves out on the streets, as the council can then class them as "intentionally homeless", and can withdraw both the promised pad and the funding for their existing emergency shelter. 
 The one thing you may think everyone would agree is essential in such circumstances is early, impartial advice. In Waltham Forest, however, it is now hard to come by. The local Citizens Advice bureau is overwhelmingly funded by a grant from the council, but the latter has restricted its work to four fields, which don't include housing. The apparent thinking is that funding housing advice is double provision, seeing as the council's own officers can give guidance on that. But you have got to wonder how willing officials will be to overturn decisions that flow from the policies of their own administration. Newham, meanwhile, does not fund Citizens Advice bureaux at all, instead providing advice itself directly. 
 Waltham Forest insists that Citizens Advice bureaux restrictions are not a sinister plot to speed social cleansing, but the simple result of central funding cuts. I tend to believe the council, but someone being shunted out of London into a distant and jobless city will understandably not see it that way. Already without a home, they now also lack the independent advice that might just have given hope.
