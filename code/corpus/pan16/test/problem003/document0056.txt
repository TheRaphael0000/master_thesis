Flick through the brochure for the Hyde Group's new development of apartments for sale, The Arc, at Packington Square, and you'll come across a photo of a flower shop sign advertising tulips at "£8 per bunch". At those prices, it must be the place that austerity forgot. 
 That's just one side of the story: residents have steered the demolition and rebuilding of the Packington estate to ensure that the new development is not only mixed tenure and mixed income, but treats social tenants as worthy of decent, secure, long-term homes. 
 The three-, four- and five-bedroom houses on the square bear no external mark that they belong to a housing association rather than to a millionaire, as tenant Tony Peters testifies. In the early 2000s, relatively prosperous years for housing associations, new social housing tended to be built through the expedient of increasing density: when old estates are demolished, the units for social rent have been paid for by squeezing in an additional number of flats for sale or rent on the open market, often sold to buy-to-let landlords or first-time buyers who will trade up within a few years. 
 In those cases, the difficulty lies in making a place, and the people who live there, "stick" without getting "stuck". Most experts with an interest in placemaking would agree that you need to fill it with families who wish to stay, who see no reason not to raise children there. The Packington development answers this problem by building family-size homes for social rent in an area where only the wealthiest can rent privately or buy family homes. 
 Hyde's intentions cannot be faulted; schemes of a similar scope and quality are unlikely to be repeated in the lifetime of a government that seeks to tell those on low incomes they are lucky to have a roof over their heads, no matter where it is or what it looks like. If you can't afford north London, move to Stoke-on-Trent. 
 The London Tenants' Federation reports that in London, social rents are already equivalent to 37% of average social tenants' household income compared with 31% outside the capital. It says that the introduction of universal credit in 2013 – when most current benefits will be folded into one unified regime and capped at £500 a week – is likely to result in much social housing being "inaccessible even to London households that are able to claim benefits". 
 The greatest pressure to uproot will fall, inevitably, on families, who need more rooms and preferably access to safe outdoor spaces. They will be the first to leave areas that need them to sustain a sense of permanence. Families will move to a town or city that has cut its services to the bone; there will be fewer public resources to draw upon at a time when they are needed most, and people who need jobs will be arriving in places without work. 
 Whether through design or malign neglect, the effect will be to concentrate poverty in already poor areas. Migrants, internal or otherwise, tend to move to those areas because of cheaper housing, cementing the relationship between poverty, opportunity and place.
