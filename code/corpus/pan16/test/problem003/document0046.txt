Good news for those in Surrey and Oxfordshire who want to raise a few million by selling a rural pile. According to estate agents Knight Frank, prices for country houses in these counties have risen by more than 3% in a year. Competition is high; bidding fierce. Why? 
 Simple, according to Rupert Sweeting, head of Knight Frank's country department. "As with any market, be it wine, art or bloodstock, the best property has sold exceptionally well in 2012." 
 At the other extreme, competition is similarly fierce. One in 12 families in England now languish on waiting lists for social housing, a form of tenure this government seemingly wants to consign to history. 
 England is facing a housing crisis comparable to the early postwar years, when the 50s equEnivalent of "sofa surfing" became a necessity until emergency housing rolled off production lines to herald the prefab revolution. 
 The National Housing Federation's Home Truths survey shows that homelessness has risen by 26% in two years. With social housing in short supply, the unregulated private sector is filling the gap. It has increased by 86% in three years. Rents have risen by an average of 37% since 2007. 
 Result? Almost half a million more working people are now reliant on housing benefit, jacking up a welfare bill that is meant to be falling. 
 The recent census underlined a dysfunctional housing structure in England which few senior politicians are prepared to address. We are witnessing a historic shift in housing patterns. This should set alarm bells ringing in Downing Street. Instead there's a deathly silence, apart from a studied rebuke from David Cameron to his planning minister, Nick Boles, for daring to advocate building in the countryside. 
 Home ownership is one casualty of this dysfunction. Rising relentlessly since the 1980s, this once-vaunted cornerstone of Thatcherism – boosted by about 2 million council house sales since the 1980s – has fallen to represent just 64% of households. 
 In London the drop is more dramatic. Under half the capital's households are now classed as owner occupied – a fall of more than 10% since 2002, as against a national average of 4%. 
 Private renting in the capital has shot up from 15% to 25%, although it is approaching 40% in the wealthiest boroughs such as Westminster. 
 This, truly, is back to the squalor and insecurity of the 1950s and 1960s – cheek-by-jowl with multimillion-pound properties bought with the small change of either overseas or City "investors", pumping up prices and oblivious to the plight of lesser mortals caught in a vice of benefit caps and rapidly rising rents. As a nation, we can do better – and we have. 
 As 2012 drew to a close, my seasonal treat took me to a music hall in east London, and a performance of song and readings entitled Love, Life and Liberty , organised by the Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA), of which I am a trustee. As well as a moving historical sweep to the late 19th century and beyond, it proved a reminder of how far England has regressed since the practical idealism of the last century, when Ebenezer Howard created a garden city in Letchworth, then in Welwyn – an inspiration for the world – built upon co-operative principles. 
 Kate Henderson, the TCPA's chief, ended with these words: "We live in a small island and are all mutually dependent on the social fabric of our communities. We should not deny our dependence, but recognise it as the true heart of human relations and the springboard for individual achievement." 
 Cameron has extolled the virtues of garden cities. He could begin 2013 by applying their principles widely to a country desperately looking for ways to fix a broken model, far beyond the insularity of Oxfordshire.
