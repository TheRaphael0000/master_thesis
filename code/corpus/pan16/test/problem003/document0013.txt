The funding for our community centre is based on the numbers of crumblies taking lunch. These numbers have fallen so there is every chance that the centre will be closed down. Madness. Lunches apart, the centre offers a daycare system for people with dementia as well as bingo, pedicure, advice clinics, geri-exercise, even baths and, when we crumblies are at home with our Ovaltine, there's other users: martial arts, weight-watchers, evangelicals. 
 One reason the numbers are down is that referrals are down and referrals are down because the medical professionals and social services have been squeezed and haven't time to inform their confused clients about what's available. 
 But another reason is because there have been complaints about "variety". Can you believe it? There's a choice every day of two main dishes, two puddings and cheese, but they want curry days, side salads, burgers, even smoothies. So they stop coming. For a generation that experienced wartime rationing, how come we've become so picky? 
 "They watch Heston, Gordon and that lot," says Charlie, as ever the advocate, "so it's natural". 
 This bodes ill for the future catering for generations who have become accustomed to wall-to-wall choice. It will take more than a tandoori, a pedicure, and a bath to satisfy that lot; they'll want sushi, geri-zumba and lap-dancing. 
 Yesterday evening, after the bingo, Joyce blamed the fall in numbers on men. "It's because you blokes are so vain," she said. 
 Now, you'd think that, as our bodies fall apart, vanity is about as appropriate as bicycles are to fish. I'm not sure that there is much to choose between the genders in terms of physical appearance, but what Joyce meant was that the male psychopathology fools itself into believing that it looks better. There is an oldies session at the sports centre twice a week when the body senescent is on display – and if humanity is made in the image of God, we should have persevered with polytheism. 
 Her point was that we blokes are the Promethean gender. We challenge the natural order of things, mocking the health and safety culture, ignoring the prostate warnings, denying loneliness and flaunting our testosterone. 
 So we see the centre as a ghetto facility reserved for the invalid, the equivalent of playing with dolls, a place where no self-respecting man would show his face. 
 I discussed it with my daughter when she came round. "Point is, you men don't chat," was her comment. 
 She's right. For men, using words has to be purposeful – a herd of buffalo seen in the vicinity, an enemy at the gates, a maiden in distress – requiring only Makaton-level linguistics, whereas women developed conceptual language as they foraged, cooked and brought up children. 
 "And you won't ask for help," she added, and told me about a new helpline service, Silver Line , to encourage older people to share their problems. 
 Right again. Chatting, sharing, they create the cross-stitch in the social cloth. It ensures that when something serious occurs there are meeting points of mutuality already in place to prevent the issue causing disproportionate damage. That's what the lunch club is for, and the Silver Line for that matter; they maintain the connections. 
 And at our age, connection is core. As we face that most divisive issue, decline and death, the synapses of social literacy really matter. So, if today's men are averse to the exchange of word of mouth, how much harder will it be for a generation that talks with its fingers?
