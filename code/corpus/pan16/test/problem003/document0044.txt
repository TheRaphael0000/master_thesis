The quality of adult relationships became the focus of government policy this month, with the prime minster introducing a "family test" and bringing what he termed "relationship support policy" under the auspices of the department for work and pensions. In outlining this position, David Cameron illustrated his vision for supporting more families to live together, and increasing intervention with so-called troubled families. While this announcement made reference to the fact that in domestic abuse cases some families may have to live apart to ensure safety, it failed to recognise the role of domestic abuse services, and the prevention of violence against women, as integral to supporting safe and protective families 
 In outlining how the government would help families, the prime minister focused attention on policy to enable equal marriage. Yet, for people to form healthy and happy relationships, in which families can be fostered and marriage considered, gender inequality must be addressed. Although the government's campaign to raise awareness of teenage relationship abuse is commendable, we are still without consistent high-quality relationships and sex education across all schools in England. In 2010, a survey of 16- to 18-year-old young women reported that a third had been sexually harassed in schools: four years on, a strategy to prevent violence against women and girls has yet to be produced. 
 Although this month's announcement identified money as one of the biggest strains on relationships, and made commitments to support parents into work, only passing reference was made to the impact of domestic abuse as a "relationship strain". Yet, a quarter of women will experience domestic abuse in their lifetime, and domestic abuse support services and perpetrator programmes are essential in mitigating the devastating impact that this can have on families. 
 Furthermore, where domestic abuse results in separation, the impact of the abuse itself can continue to affect the family unit for years to come. The rates of domestic abuse in this country imply that it is impossible to develop adequate family-related policy without addressing the issue. 
 Relationships, families, and the abuse that happens within them, do not occur in a vacuum. They occur within a society in which two women are killed every week by a partner or ex-partner and, in 2012, an estimated 85,000 women were raped. In order to create environments that are supportive of healthy relationships and families, such damming statistics should be at the forefront of any related policy. 
 This government has developed annual action plans to tackle violence against women and girls and the home secretary has demonstrated a commitment to this issue. However, the lack of reference to domestic abuse in the government's family policy implies that it is a matter seen primarily as a criminal justice rather than social policy issue. Only two days after the family test was announced the government launched a consultation on creating a crime of "domestic abuse" to improve the police's response to the issue. 
 As Labour announces a new shadow minister to help prevent violence against women and girls and the Lib Dems make commitments to deliver statutory sex and relationship education across all schools , political parties are seeking to demonstrate a commitment to tackling gender-based violence. Yet, it is not clear whether these announcements complement other policy areas. 
 Rather than adding further criminal legislation, it may serve the government, and other parties, better to ensure that policies related to relationships, families and abuse are better coordinated towards prevention.
