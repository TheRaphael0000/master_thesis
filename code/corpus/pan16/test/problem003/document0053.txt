Jobseeker's allowance (JSA) for someone aged under 25 is £56.80 a week. According to the prime minster, this is too much and it will be set to zero if a Conservative majority is returned at the next election. 
 Only 37.6% of the 1.09 million young people who are unemployed in the UK claim benefits, and they each receive, on average, £2,927 a year to live on. Although very few young adults are unlucky enough to have to claim JSA for a whole year, the constant churn from one low- or no-hours contract to another, on to one training scheme and then to none, means that almost as many young people join the dole queue every week as leave it. Dole is the lifeline between the bad options. The Tories want to cut that lifeline. 
 The number of young adults claiming their £8 a day is so low because it has been made so hard to claim JSA, and because – for any young person in a family with the money – the incentive for their parents to bail them out instead is so high. 
 In the 1980s, you claimed unemployment benefit by going to your local dole office and signing on every two weeks. However, you did not have to take any job you were offered or sign on for any cack-handed advice or sham education scheme. Signing on gave you a little room for manoeuvre; it gave you a tiny amount of choice. 
 When I left school, I signed on and then took a job working on a children's play scheme during the summer before I went to university. I did this for three summers in the late 1980s. The dole gave me the choice to do a good job, being paid £3 an hour, rather than take a worse job, any job, and undercut whoever else might have done that work. The dole stopped me fuelling the race to the bottom, and I also learned a little about how to try to keep several hundred children safe and happy in a public park, while many of their parents worked. It was probably the most difficult job I have ever done, and by the third summer I think I was good at it. 
 Later, when I was 21, I signed on again. I had finished my degree and had no job to go to. All my applications for postgraduate study had been turned down, but, again, the dole gave me a little breathing space, just enough to look and think. Someone dropped out of a course and I got their place. I found paid work during my studies too, as the grant was not enough to live on, but the dole was part of the mix that made choice possible. 
 However, if you've never been turned down, if you've never found it hard to get a job, if you've never needed some space and time, how could you understand that asking for £8 a day to live on, when you have no other money coming in, is not asking for much? 
 A functioning labour market is one in which people have a choice to say no to work that it is too demeaning, too poorly paid, too dangerous or too dirty. Then employers need to offer us enough money if they want that work done. Otherwise you have slavery and servitude. 
 People may think that these benefit cuts will not hurt them and their family and friends. But, if at first they cut the rights of those aged under 25, how long before they cut rights for older people, and rights to other things we once took for granted, such as the provision of free education at ages 16 and 17?
