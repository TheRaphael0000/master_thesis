The statistics revealed by the Guardian today are shocking. They must serve as a wake-up call to both the government and the third sector. Acevo has been warning for three years that charities are struggling to meet rising demand for their services while their income is falling. These figures not only confirm that trend, but demonstrate the scale of the financial challenge facing the sector. They show that many charities and community groups are facing the real threat of closure, with hugely damaging consequences for the beneficiaries and causes they serve. 
 The fact that close on 10% of voluntary organisations are questioning whether they will still exist in five years' time should give everyone cause for concern. The impact of such a loss on local communities and the most vulnerable would be incalculable. Charities, community groups and other voluntary organisations often take years to build up, driven by the passion and energy of committed people. Once they have been allowed to disappear, they cannot simply be recreated when circumstances improve. And while too many of us sometimes take charities for granted, we would certainly notice the impact of their disappearance. 
 So we need the government to take action. But charities also need to think of how they can perform better. 
 The low confidence in the government reflected by the survey shows that there is a great deal more it could do. The enormous cuts made to welfare and local government budgets have created significant extra demand for charities' services, while at the same time slashing much of their income. As this survey shows, the situation is becoming untenable for many. We need a reaffirmation of the coalition's commitment to protecting the most vulnerable, and an end to swingeing cuts aimed at the easiest targets. We must also see an end to disproportionate, indiscriminate cuts to the voluntary sector by local government. This means that the government must ensure that the statutory Best Value guidance it produced in 2011 on the way councils should work with voluntary and community groups is properly enforced. 
 It could do more to support the sector's access to a wider range of income streams. Consultations on social investment tax relief and corporate social responsibility are positive steps, but there is potential for much more, for instance around expanding social finance, especially through access to unsecured loans and making it simpler and easier for people to donate. 
 The government must also rediscover its energy on public service reform. It is essential that we deliver services more efficiently and effectively to alleviate some of the impact of funding cuts on beneficiaries. Charities and social enterprises have the ability to play a key role in improving delivery, owing to their capacity for innovation and their close connections with and understanding of beneficiaries and their needs. However, they must be properly funded and commissioned, and not treated simply as a cut-price alternative to state provision. 
 Third-sector bodies have no divine right to exist for ever. We need to see more partnerships, alliances and consortia working to achieve scale. Acevo has been supporting many local organisations to form consortia to bid for public service contracts, helping to combine the strength of local and national charities to deliver effectively for the people they serve. 
 It is now time to put the third sector at the forefront of a national response to the challenges of our times. As the Guardian's survey shows, there is no time to waste.
