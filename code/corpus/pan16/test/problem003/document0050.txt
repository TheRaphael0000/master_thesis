The day my Mum died, the family found it unexpectedly difficult to honour her wish to donate her brain for medical research. Just over a year ago I wrote an article for Society Guardian describing our experience. It explained how bereaved families sometimes encounter unnecessary obstacles, even when all the required consent forms have been completed before the death. Officialdom responded positively to that criticism, although it still has more to do. 
 When Florence Carvel died, aged 92, we called the brain bank at King's College London to activate the donation procedure. However, none of the nearby NHS or local authority mortuaries were willing to carry out the brain donation postmortem. 
 The brain bank's administrator advised that he was more likely to persuade another mortuary to do the job if we got Mum's death formally registered. That would provide us with the "green form" that some NHS trusts mistakenly believed was needed before a donation could take place. We secured an appointment at a nearby registrar's office, registered Mum's death and faxed the green form to the brain bank. The donation went ahead. 
 It is widely accepted that researchers into dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases need to investigate samples of human brain tissue. So why was the NHS unable to facilitate the donation of brains? Money was not the reason, since the brain bank would pay for the procedure. It seemed that the problem was the ignorance of jobsworths. 
 Paul Burstow, then care services minister, organised for clear advice to be sent to NHS trusts. The advice duly appeared in the NHS chief executive's weekly bulletin. It said: "Insisting on sight of the Registrar's 'Green Form' to action the donation of a brain for research, or before releasing a body, is not a legal requirement, and can cause delays and distress to the bereaved â€¦ NHS chief executives will wish to consider how they support donation of brains for research." 
 The Human Tissue Authority has also stepped up efforts to inform trusts that they are already licensed to perform the limited postmortems required for brain donation. 
 Previously unpublished fFigures from the Medical Research Council (MRC) show that the number of brain donations increased from 624 in 2011 to a record 736 in 2012. 
 James Ironside, director of the MRC UK Brain Banks Network , says: "The impact of the Guardian article helped us to persuade some trusts that they could and should help us." 
 The MRC has launched a new online database to speed up access to donated brain samples held across the 10 brain banks in the UK. 
 But as David Dexter, scientific director of Parkinson's UK Tissue Bank, points out: "Things are moving in the right direction, but more pushing is needed. Some NHS trusts bend over backwards to help us. Others still have the blinkers on."
