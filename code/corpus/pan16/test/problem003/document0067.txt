What do you do when government policies don’t work at all? The work capability assessment (WCA) is an obvious example. It is part of a system that is meant to help disabled people into work when possible, and support those who can’t work because of illness and disability. Instead, it is a fit-to-work test that doesn’t function properly, because it is badly designed and poorly carried out. Many disabled people find the WCA punitive, humiliating and distressing. 
 These problems are well documented, including the failures of Atos to conduct WCAs. From March, a new company, Maximus, will be taking over that contract. 
 Whether people will have a significant change in their assessment experience remains to be seen. Whatever happens at the next general election, all the main political parties are signed up to some kind of fitness for work test. 
 One element of Maximus’ approach to WCAs is to provide disability equality and awareness training to healthcare professionals and others involved in carrying out the test. It invited bids to carry out this training. As a charity led by disabled people, which provides similar training to a number of companies, Disability Rights UK had a dilemma. Should we bid for the work? 
 We understand why some disabled people would have reservations about us working with an organisation involved in delivering WCAs. However, after considerable debate, the board and senior staff decided that we should put in a bid. 
 It was successful and we have been awarded a contract by Maximus to provide training to 1,500 staff over a year. While there is no scope to influence the content of the assessment, the contract gives us a chance to work directly with the healthcare professionals who deliver it, improving their understanding of the practicalities of living with an impairment or a long-term condition and the barriers disabled people face. 
 At the same time, we will be generating some income that will be used to provide independent information and support for disabled people. Last year saw more than a million downloads from our website on a range of issues. And there is a “no gagging” clause in our contract with Maximus, which means we can continue to tell it like it is when it comes to government policy on disability, ill health, employment and assessments. There is also a break clause that ensures we can end the contract if we feel we need to. 
 Disability Rights UK will continue to campaign vigorously to fix a broken policy, and be a strong voice for disabled people. We hope we will also make people’s experience of the WCA a little easier.
