Early on in this volume, the fourth of six autobiographical novels with the group title My Struggle, Karl Ove Knausgaard lists some of the books he consumed as a teenager, most of them Scandinavian, a few American, all telling the same story: 
 Knausgaard’s desperation to emulate his literary heroes (“I had to be big. I had to be. If not, I might as well top myself”) forms the central narrative of My Struggle, which recounts the growth of the author’s mind, the childhood that shaped him, the obstacles, misadventures and breakthroughs, the agony and ecstasy of being Karl Ove. How he succeeds in making this so compelling over the course of 3,600 pages is a puzzle that critics and scholars find difficult to crack. 
 The latest instalment gives some clues. It picks up the story with Knausgaard, aged 18, setting off to the remote north of Norway to teach in a small village school. He’ll have his own flat and space in which to write, he thinks, but the locals keep dropping by to check him out. The teaching isn’t as straightforward as he hoped. And though he does get some writing done, and we are treated to passages from it, he is prey to two huge distractions: women and booze. 
 Actually the women are mostly girls in their early teens, and pupils of his, which adds to his problems. Never afraid of humiliating confessions (which include an account, in volume two, of disfiguring his face with a razor after a romantic rejection), Knausgaard owns up to transgressive desires for one girl, Andrea, in particular. He resists, and takes care to hides his erections in class, but can find no outlet for his erotic fantasies. “The fact was I had never masturbated,” he explains (“wanking belonged to the unthinkable”), and every encounter with a woman he can legitimately have sex with ends before it’s even begun. “Karl Ove’s Complaint”, the volume might have been called, because of its excruciating detail about premature ejaculation and nocturnal emissions. At 18 he is still a virgin and deeply despondent about it. Running alongside the author narrative (will his writing come to anything?) is the sex narrative: will he get laid? 
 So far, so typically teen flick: “I was just a ridiculous teenager who knew nothing about anything,” he says at one point. Rather than standing at a disdainful 20-year distance from his angsty, hormonal younger self, he inhabits him fully, to hilarious effect: “Her breasts were big, her legs long. What more could I want? Nothing, that covered everything.” “Quite often I caught myself wishing we were still in the stone age, then all I needed was to go out with a club, hit the nearest woman on the head and drag her home to do whatever I wanted.” He’s not a particularly likable young man. Indeed, at times he’s particularly dislikable. He steals, chucks litter in the street, has a homophobic panic attack (“Oh, no, don’t say he was one of them”), and pees all over a tramp on a park bench. The strategy resembles Rousseau’s in The Confessions, in which he invites readers to “blush at my depravity”. Take me as I am, he is saying, warts and all, then he wins us round through his indifference to winning us round. 
 If there is courage in his candour, it is there in the structure of the book, too. On page 126, waking in a panic of amnesia after a night on the razzle at the end of his first week’s teaching, he embarks on a digression documenting earlier blackouts brought on by alcoholic excess. The digression becomes a flashback covering several years and taking in his abusive father, hard-working mother, brother Yngve, grandparents, assorted friends and girlfriends (as well as a flash forward to him at 40 writing in his Malm&ouml; flat), before culminating, on page 364, in the sale of the family home immediately before his departure to northern Norway. A 240-page flashback! When he is accepted on a writing course in Bergen at the end of this volume, Knausgaard will doubtless be taught that no book should ever be split down the middle like that. But rules are there to be broken, and his veering off course doesn’t ruin the momentum. 
 “I wasn’t much good at dealing with trivialities,” his younger self declares, ranting against the pettiness of the adult world. But that was then; the mature Knausgaard finds nothing too banal for his attention. In A Man in Love, the second volume in the series (and still the best), he describes taking his daughter to a children’s party, a sequence that lasts for 50 pages. There is nothing on that scale here, but we do get a paragraph devoted to him filling the coffee machine in the school staffroom and another listing the presents he receives one Christmas. The minutiae have no metaphoric weight; they’re never more than themselves. But they root the story in real time and place, acting as guarantors of authenticity. 
 At least they seem to. How far Knausgaard remains faithful to the truth is another teasing question. “I remembered hardly anything from my childhood,” he writes in an earlier volume. “I could remember all the places I had been, all the rooms I had been in. Just not what happened there.” This volume gives fair warning, too. Within his family, he says, even as a child, “I gained a reputation for being unreliable, I was someone who lied and made things up.” Moreover, the wine- and hash-filled month before he left to teach was, he says, so “packed with such incidents, I wasn’t sure whether they had happened or not”, and included “enormous tracts of time of which I remembered nothing”. How accurate is his recall of his year up north, then? Even he doesn’t seem to know: “I have never been back but I do sometimes have nightmares about it … Did terrible things happen there? Did I do something I shouldn’t have done? Something awful?” He mentions keeping a diary, and there is another account he (and we) can check: his first book, Out of the World (1998), is set in the same place and deals with some of the same experiences, sexual desire for a 13-year-old among them. With that novel, he says: “I paid no regard to the relationship between fiction and reality.” With this book, he is acutely conscious of the relationship, but that doesn’t mean we’re getting the gospel truth. 
 The young Karl Ove he presents is both horribly ordinary – insecure yet arrogant, sensitive yet boorish – and a man apart. Like every other kid, he has his favourite bands and solo artists (Simple Minds, Talking Heads, David Bowie, Eric Clapton); unlike them, he is writing a weekly music column for a newspaper by the age of 16. Bored by the countryside, he is also moved by its beauty: the sea, the mountains, the northern lights coldly burning in the sky. He is himself – “the real me” – when with his mum, or kissing a girl, or drunk with his mates, but these selves can’t be reconciled. He reads widely (Joyce, Hamsun, Tolkien, Hemingway, Kundera, Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez), but finds it hard to learn from them: “I had only one world, so that was the one I had to write about.” 
 How he eventually succeeded in writing about it, at manic speed and great length, and the trouble in which it landed him (including legal threats from members of his family) as well as the acclaim he has received as the Norwegian Proust – all this is a well-known story. Less acknowledged is how much his popularity in the English-speaking world is due to the excellence of his translator, Don Bartlett, whose prose is brilliantly attuned to the onward rush of someone thinking aloud, especially when those thoughts are gloomstruck, as they are for instance when the young Karl Ove reflects on his shame at still being a virgin at 18: 
 The passage offers a double take: adolescent torment is fully registered, but we know it will pass, that the shame will be spoken, that it is being spoken to us here. The effect is comic, a trait not always associated with Scandinavian writers, but one that is essential to Knausgaard. The narrator may be intellectually earnest, an aesthete who meditates on the sublime, but he is also a hapless fool, prone to Chaplinesque pratfalls. In exposing himself as a bundle of contradictions, Knausgaard also allows us to see ourselves. And for the most part, however unattractive his teenage self looks in this volume, it works wonderfully well.
