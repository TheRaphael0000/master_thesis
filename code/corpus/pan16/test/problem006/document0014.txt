When the great 17th-century antiquary and biographer John Aubrey gathered together the manuscript pages on which he had written his scrappy, erratic, brilliant, long-deferred and unpublished “Brief Lives”, he added to the giant pile a fragmentary account of his own life. He prefaced this with a modest and teasing instruction that it was “to be interponed as a sheet of waste paper only in the binding of a book”. The symbolism was characteristic: Aubrey knew that he had spent much of his time enabling other people’s work and that his own “Life”, as a result, might well be used as an endpaper for someone else’s great achievement. Still, he wasn’t going to be entirely left out. 
 Ruth Scurr has taken the bold step of writing Aubrey’s life as he might have written it himself had he kept a diary, and as indeed he did write it (as we all write our lives) across hundreds of notes, letters, lists and annotations. So we open Scurr’s book expecting a biography and find instead an invented journal, which might well cause some apprehension. But doubts are quickly forgotten. We are immersed in Aubrey’s world, listening to his voice, learning from his wide sympathies, worrying with him, cringing for him, wanting terribly to make him get on and publish his work before someone steals it. Scurr’s judgment and scholarship in constructing Aubrey’s own account of events are so flawless that she allows us almost to forget that she is there. Formal inventiveness can be showy, but Scurr’s invention is of the most self-effacing kind. She wants us to hear Aubrey’s own voice, and no wonder: he is, as she says, “one of the finest English prose writers there has ever been”. 
 Even as a boy Aubrey was in love with the past. Scurr recreates the wistful intensity of the hours he spent in the grounds of Wilton House, imagining himself into Philip Sidney ’s Arcadia, “trying to catch sight of” the long-dead people who once talked on the terrace in the dusk. For the rest of his life Aubrey would be trying to glimpse things that had gone. His vocation, as he understood it, was to salvage debris from the shipwreck of time. It pained him to find sheets of manuscript from Malmesbury Abbey being used to line a pie case or to stop the bunghole of an ale barrel – history relegated to waste paper. 
 Church towers and intricately carved effigies spoke to him of human efforts towards peaceful creativity. Yet he was surrounded by violence. He was just discovering the joy of libraries and friendship in Oxford when the civil war broke out and suddenly there were soldiers in the Bodleian cutting books from their chains. In 1642 one might have found Aubrey making careful drawings of the escutcheons in the glass at Trinity College, lest he should wake the next day and find them smashed. He felt acutely the vulnerability of all that he valued. 
 He became the most knowledgable and resourceful antiquary of his time, travelling for weeks on horseback as he toured derelict abbeys, drew monuments and amassed huge reference collections of English place names, inscriptions, window shapes (by which he learned to date buildings), and samples of handwriting from across six centuries (which helped him in the dating of manuscripts). When he was exhausted and bankrupt, he felt compelled to keep going: “This searching after antiquities is a wearisome business, yet nobody else will do it.” When his contemporaries ignored him, he thought of the future: “I hope the next generation will be less brutish.” 
 Though he had many grand projects on the go – an account of all the Roman camps in Britain, historical surveys of Wiltshire and Surrey – he was always quicker to help with others’ inquiries than to get on with his own. A natural collaborator, he wanted his research to be part of a conversation. Meetings of the newly formed Royal Society were highlights of his calendar: five fellows were to plant wheat and compare the results; or Francis Potter was to demonstrate the movement of blood between chickens; or Aubrey was to present his findings about spring water, the only good thing to come out of the time he spent waiting for Joan Sumner to marry him. (She didn’t. She sued him instead.) Night after night Aubrey sat up late in the coffee houses on Exchange Alley with the society’s “curator of experiments” Robert Hooke, gossiping, remembering, questioning the world, bringing about an intellectual revolution. 
 Aubrey knew how valuable he was as a friend and assistant, and that something – but what was it? – kept him from completing books of his own. “What did I do that was worthy?” he asked sadly; he had been, he thought, a “whetstone, itself incapable of cutting”, but vital in sharpening others’ wits. For 30 years he conducted research for the duplicitous Oxford historian Anthony Wood, whom he patiently loved as his dearest friend whatever pressures and abuses Wood sent in return. There is no doubt that Aubrey was outrageously exploited, but he clung on because he longed for dialogue. 
 “I fancy myself all along discoursing with you,” he told Wood as he worked, alone, on his “Lives”. From that unpromising discourse emerged Aubrey’s spirited reinvention of life writing. The lapidary phrases of formal commemorations would not do for him. He wanted to know about private habits and idiosyncrasies, the sound of a man’s voice and the fit of his clothes, the ordinary things that can so easily go missing from official records, the things by which you would know Hooke immediately if you needed to find him in a crowded coffee house. 
 Aubrey saw the need for tactful omissions and the sewing-on of fig leaves while a subject was alive, but for posterity he wanted to set down the truth, “exposed so bare that the very pudenda are not covered”. In a biography, he thought, the “minuteness of a famous person is grateful”, or, as Scurr has him say, “minute details about a famous person should be gratefully recorded”. Aubrey was grateful for every bit of knowledge he could acquire, and often, too, he felt a warm sense of gratitude towards his subjects as he tried to understand their lives. Many readers will, in turn, feel grateful to have met Aubrey at such close quarters and to look through his eyes at a defining era of British history. 
 Reading this book, we seem to “catch sight of” the past. Aubrey at 19 sits sadly in his room at Broad Chalke, a young man called home from Oxford, missing his new friends, investing all his hopes of life in the book he is reading: Thomas Browne ’s Religio Medici, just published. Later he stands nervously beside King Charles II on top of Silbury Hill, pointing out the line of Avebury Avenue, mastering his stammer as he sees that the King is interested in what he says. Later still, heartbroken, he makes drawings of the ancestral home he is forced to sell, allowing himself to fantasise about the garden he might have planted and the improvements he might have made to the facade. Scurr allows us to feel we are in Aubrey’s company, which is a generous gift indeed.
