I haven’t myself sat on Sir Thomas Browne’s brain, but it’s possible to do so. Well, more or less. If you go to Hay Hill in Norwich there is, between Topshop and Next, a more than bench-sized sculpture by Anne and Patrick Poirier of this capacious organ. It’s opposite a more orthodox statue of this great 17th-century scientist, antiquarian and prose writer, which was put up in 1905 to mark the tercentenary of Browne’s birth. Both memorials are near the site of the house in which Browne spent most of his life. This was demolished in 1842 and is now occupied by a Pret a Manger. It’s also possible to view a cast of Browne’s skull in his parish church. Hugh Aldersey-Williams has measured it (apparently it’s 14.7 cm wide) as part of his effort to get inside the head of Sir Thomas Browne. 
 Browne was born in London in 1605, and studied medicine at Oxford, Padua and Leiden. In 1637 he moved to Norwich, where he practised as a physician until his death in 1682. “By snatches of time, as medical vacations and the fruitless importunities of uroscopy permit”, he wrote some of the best prose in English (uroscopy is the practice of diagnosing patients from their urine). A typical Browne sentence unfurls with a majesty enriched by digression and encrusted with neologism, and often springs quizzical surprises on his readers along the way. 
 Browne’s first published work, Religio Medici (printed in 1642 but written in about 1635), was a form of spiritual autobiography that presented his tolerant and eclectic religious beliefs to a country increasingly divided along sectarian lines. He was the kind of sceptic who regards the imperfections of human reason as an encouragement rather than a barrier to belief: it “is no vulgar part of faith to believe a thing not only above, but contrary to reason, and against the arguments of our proper senses”. Pseudodoxia Epidemica (1646) is a study of what Browne calls “vulgar errors”, in which he records and usually corrects popular misconceptions about the natural world. So, Browne tells us, dead kingfishers, contrary to popular belief, do not make good weathervanes. If you hang two of them up (and he has tried) they often point in opposite directions. But “That some Elephants have not only written whole sentences... but have also spoken... we do not conceive impossible.” 
 That combination of curious learning, reserved judgment, credulity and proto-scientific method runs through his other major works. Hydriotaphia, Urn-Burial (1658) meditates on death and cremation in the light of an archaeological discovery of a cluster of urns containing burned bones in a field near Walsingham. “Who knows the fate of his bones?” Browne reflects. The Garden of Cyrus (1658) explores the benefits of planting trees in a lattice-like arrangement, and muses on the “mystical mathematics” of the number five. Browne also wrote a glorious inventory of a fictional museum (Musaeum Clausum) full of lost and impossible objects, such as “The Skin of a Snake bred out of the Spinal Marrow of a Man” and a letter from Cicero’s brother describing Britain in the age of Julius Caesar. 
 In all of these works you can witness the large brain of Browne at work, thinking, questioning, but rarely dogmatising. He was preoccupied with the limits of our knowledge, as he shows in Hydriotaphia, when he says: “A Dialogue between two infants in the womb concerning the state of this world, might handsomely illustrate our ignorance of the next.” That may appear to be a piece of logical cheating: we are in a position to know that there is a world outside the womb, but we do not know that there is a world after death. But that is its point. We may, when it comes to the afterlife, be infants – a word that, as Browne well knew, derived from the Latin infans, “unable to speak”. Maybe in much of our engagement with this world, too, we are infants, trying to understand phenomena for which we do not yet have words. 
 Aldersey-Williams’s richly detailed book reminds us what a fertile inventor of new words Browne was: the Oxford English Dictionary cites him as the first user of the word “electricity” – “a tenuous emanation or continued effluvium, which after some distance retracteth into itself”, which Aldersey-Williams rather hopefully says “all but gives a statement of the inverse square law”. “Incontrovertible”, “hallucination” and “cryptography” are other Browneisms that entered the language, though quite a few of his coinages (from “alliciency” – attractiveness, to “zodiographer” – one who writes about animals) didn’t catch on. 
 Aldersey-Williams finds more than words to wonder at in Browne. His main aim is to show that Browne’s “tolerant and forgiving” style provides a model for writing and thinking about science today. In the 17th century “science” and “learning” encompassed all areas of knowledge – the physical world, the metaphysical world, as well as poetry and biblical scholarship. Aldersey-Williams argues that modern writers on science, who know and write about a much narrower range of phenomena, often sound “arrogant yet embattled, pious yet aggrieved” and are too reluctant to accept that there might be more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in their philosophy. They could learn from Browne’s tolerance and scepticism. He presents Browne as a ruminative alternative to the unassailable dogmatism of Richard Dawkins, and uses him to generate a conversation between 17th century and present-day science. This at one point becomes a fictional dialogue between Aldersey-Willliams himself and his hero, in which he imagines the statue of Browne stepping down from its plinth in the centre of Norwich to discuss with him the nature of belief. Although Aldersey-Williams is a scientist and an atheist, he is willing to wonder whether “the credulous in fact know something the rest of us don’t”. He balks at the Browne who believed in witches and who gave evidence in 1662 against two women charged with witchcraft, but repeatedly finds in his writings phenomena that pose problems for modern science. If people believe (as some did in Browne’s day and some do today) that they are infested with minute worms or “morgellons”, what sort of phenomenon is that? Is it real? Is it a virus spread by the internet, or is it (to use one of Browne’s words) a hallucination? 
 The book is a delightful read because it shares the curiosity – both in the sense of being interested in everything and in the sense of risking being odd – of its subject. It has a Brownean motion, digressing and speculating as it makes connections between the past and the present. Aldersey-Williams reminds us there is a fine and continually moving line between knowledge and belief, and that to move with that line we must be circumspect in the ways we present what we believe to be true. This is where Browne can be our guide. 
 The Adventures of Thomas Browne in the 21st Century can’t rival the artistry of WG Sebald’s meditations on Browne in Rings of Saturn, but it’s written with passion and affection. Its greatest virtue is that you come away from it liking both Browne and Aldersey-Williams. So when the latter discusses melancholy – one of Browne’s life-long concerns and companions – he shows how rapidly medical opinion about depression has changed, and then says that occasional bouts of melancholia “are to be cherished as a proper response to the way we find the world”. His own list of rational grounds for feeling low looks pretty sound to me: “Pygmy politicians. Apparently inexorably increasing social inequality. Ukip. The corruption of schools and universities by the ideology that their sole purpose is to equip people to fill ‘jobs’”. He is also lowered by the tendency of his garden to succumb to entropy, which is not surprising given that he believes “gardens are a project for people who have given up on intellectual commerce and ideas”. Reflecting on this, as I planted out my broad beans, I found I couldn’t quite agree, but in the spirit of Thomas Browne I decided to accept that people can reasonably differ about many things, including the value of gardening. “Rare poems ask rare friends,” said Ben Jonson. This is one of those books that makes you feel that you’ve made friends both with its subject and its author.
