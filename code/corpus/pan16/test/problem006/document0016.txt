Even when reduced from three dimensions to two, Stan Lee manages to be viscerally irritating. The man who has been the public face of Marvel Comics for more than half a century is infamous for his “Kpow!”, “Blam!”, “Take That!” approach to self-presentation. Revered for coming up with the concepts of Fantastic Four, Spiderman and Thor in the 1960s, Lee is sometimes suspected of hogging the credit from the illustrators who created the visuals for his superheroes (he is strictly a words man). In addition, questions have sometimes hovered over the many fallings-out and patches of failure that have marked Lee’s long – he was born in 1922 – career. 
 This graphic autobiography, then, could have been the place to put things right, even make a restitution or two. But Lee, who introduced the concept of the flawed, self-doubting superhero in the so-called “Silver Age” of comic books, doesn’t really do doubt himself. If he resembles anyone, it is Captain America, a superhero from the previous generation on whose stories he was put to work when he joined the precursor of Marvel Comics in 1939. All spandexed certainty, the Captain is armed with a magic shield off which bounce insults, enemies and stray gamma rays. The shield can be used as a weapon, too, when chucked and spun through the air. Lee, one feels, probably has something similar concealed about his person. 
 The graphic format of Amazing, Fantastic, Incredible allows the narrative of Lee’s life to be chopped up and stitched together in ways that would soothe even the most fretful narcissist. Tricky moments can be dismissed in a single frame – the crash of Stan Lee Media in 2000 is dealt with in a single image of Lee looking a bit glum and the line: “It ended badly and the less said the better.” Meanwhile, good times – the founding of POW! Entertainment the following year – can be stretched out into multiple frames, including several lavished on Lee’s next creation, Stripperella, a TV series starring Pamela Anderson as Erotica Jones, pole dancer by day and lady superhero by night (or possibly the other way round). 
 In particular, Lee’s tricky relationships with his key artists at Marvel are smuggled into the gaps between the frames. Steve Ditko, his co-creator on Spidey, is dispatched with a vague, brisk “I was never sure what bothered him”. And of Jack Kirby, with whom Lee fashioned X-Men and The Incredible Hulk, all he has to say is: “It’s hard to correct a misunderstanding if you don’t know what it is that’s misunderstood.” In a conventional autobiography, made up of contiguous text, this kind of shrugging and shuffling alerts the attentive reader to the fact that something fishy is going on and needs further investigation. In a graphic book, the eye is merely bustled along by the bold artwork, as if an impatient tour guide were hovering at your elbow, insisting there is nothing here to see. 
 Still, there are sections in the narrative where Colleen Doran’s illustrations are allowed to linger to brilliant effect. Particularly evocative is her recreation of the Depression-era Washington Heights of Stanley Lieber’s childhood. Crammed into a tiny apartment, watching his immigrant father go hopelessly through the job ads while his mother frets about food, young Stanley takes refuge in the imaginative worlds of Twain, Burroughs, Verne and Poe. He becomes Huck Finn, Tarzan, even HG Wells’s Time Traveller. If there is enough money, he goes to the movie theatre to watch Errol Flynn as Robin Hood; if there isn’t, he stays home and listens to Jack Benny and Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy on the wireless. 
 Doran has a field day with period detail, using a washed-out palette of mauve and fawn over which the young hero’s imaginary encounters with storybook characters sprinkle blinding stardust. For comic book aficionados there are also plenty of sly references to earlier, iconic work. Lee’s meeting with his future wife Joan is rendered as a riff on Peter Parker’s first encounter with Mary Jane Watson. The technically-minded, meanwhile, will spot homages to Kirby’s particular way of drawing unspecified energy as a series of black dots, known within the industry as “Kirby Krackle”. 
 The graphic format also allows Doran to create the perfect visual representation of an old man’s memory. There is much jumping around and jumping ahead, with lengthy and slightly tedious detours to list all Lee’s boastful and beside-the-point encounters with the US’s various first families. As a teenage cinema usher he is accosted by Eleanor Roosevelt, as a senior citizen he makes George W Bush laugh. Along the way, Hillary Clinton bumps into him more than once and always remembers who he is. Doran plays these moments tenderly straight, although in other places she is quite happy to show us Lee in what feels like his true colours, as a bold, brash showman whose greatest creation has always been himself. 
 Why, you wonder, did Lee allow these moments of gracelessness through to the final edit? The clue perhaps comes in the fact that there is another co-creator listed on the cover: Peter David, who is a veteran comic book writer. In other words, Amazing, Fantastic, Incredible starts to feel suspiciously like it might be a ghost-written, graphic memoir, using as its source material the conventional autobiography that Lee published in 2002, Excelsior: the Amazing Life of Stan Lee. Who knows, then, exactly how much involvement Lee had in the fine detail of this latest iteration of his life story? It’s at this point, faced with urgent epistemological questions about authorial authenticity and intent, that my critical thought bubble dissolved into a starburst of Kirby Krackle.
