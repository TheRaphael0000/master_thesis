In 1527, a fleet of five ships set sail from Spain for the New World, on a mission to settle the recently discovered land of La Florida. After making landfall on the Gulf coast, near where the city of St Petersburg stands today, the expedition’s leader, P&aacute;nfilo de Narv&aacute;ez, headed into the country’s unmapped interior in search of the gold he had convinced himself would be found there. Within days his men became hopelessly lost; soon after they began to die, from starvation, disease, drowning and the depredations of local tribes. In the end, of an original contingent of 300, just four survived: three Spanish gentlemen – &Aacute;lvar N&uacute;&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo and Andr&eacute;s Dorantes – and Estebanico, a Moorish slave. 
 History, it’s said, is written by the victors. While the Narv&aacute;ez expedition was a catastrophe of almost absurd proportions, its name used for years afterwards as a byword for disaster, these four men (who were eventually picked up in northern Mexico by a group of Spanish slavers, “strangely dressed and in the company of Indians”), were, if not victors, at least survivors. Together, they’d lived through the worst the continent could throw at them and even, ultimately, carved out a niche for themselves as healers among the indigenous Americans. Their reappearance was a triumph bordering on the miraculous, and Cabeza de Vaca’s tale of their adventures, which he published on his return to Spain, was justly celebrated. But his story also revealed that, even among survivors, some are more equal than others. While the three Castilians were given joint billing, the slave who had been with them every step of the way for the eight long years of their exile was confined to a single line of biography. “The fourth [of us],” says Cabeza de Vaca, “is Estebanico, an Arab Negro from Azemmour.” And that’s it. 
 When she came across Cabeza de Vaca’s chronicle nearly 500 years after it was written, Laila Lalami was first puzzled, then fascinated by the omission. Nowadays, Estebanico is believed by many to have been the first African explorer of North America and is consequently feted as a figure of historical significance, but at the time, his skin colour and his status ensured his silence. Lalami’s Pulitzer prize-shortlisted, Booker-longlisted novel is her attempt to give him a voice. The Moor’s Account returns us to the astonishing, terrifying world of light, heat and violence that Cabeza de Vaca described, seen this time through the eyes of a man who has been taken there as property, and has neither the sense of manifest destiny nor the prospect of personal enrichment that propelled the Castilians forward. 
 Cabeza de Vaca told us nothing of Estebanico’s backstory, so Lalami furnishes him with one of her own invention; his jaundiced account of the expedition is interspersed with heartsick reminiscences of his former life. His real name, we learn, is Mustafa; at one time, a prosperous merchant in a prosperous Moroccan city. But when Azemmour fell to the Portuguese in 1513 its inhabitants quickly began to starve, and Mustafa, desperate to save his family, sold himself into slavery. He was shipped to Seville and hauled into a church, where he was christened and renamed; his faith and his identity stripped from him in a single act. 
 This ability of language to shape reality is The Moor’s Account ’s leitmotif, and it’s through Lalami’s investigation of it that her novel breaks out of the historical fiction ghetto and establishes its broader enterprise. “How utterly strange were the ways of the Castilians,” muses Mustafa as, fresh off the boat in La Florida, he listens to the expedition’s notary claim the ground they stand on for God, St Peter and the King. “Just by saying that something was so, they believed that it was. I know now that these conquerors... gave speeches not to voice the truth, but to create it.” Yet for all his professed bemusement, it becomes clear as the novel unfolds that it is precisely Mustafa’s own gift for storytelling, for using words to remodel the world around him, that permits him to survive. A natural linguist, he is quick to pick up the languages of the new world, and when the travellers encounter new tribes, his telling of their tale secures them gifts of food and shelter. Later, their foreign folk remedies earn them a reputation as medicine men, and their situation becomes less dicey – but with success comes the possibility of failure, and failure, in their position, would likely prove fatal. Again, Mustafa falls back on words. “If I was confronted with an illness I did not recognise,” he says, “I listened to the sick man or woman and offered consolation in the guise of a long story... This, too, was something I learned in the markets of Azemmur: a good story can heal.” 
 The Moor’s Account is more than a good story, it’s a great one: rich, vivid and gripping; a thoughtful investigation into how we frame the narratives of our own lives. Lalami’s creation of Estebanico on the page as a living, breathing, fully realised human being, meanwhile, gives him a chance at the afterlife which his fellow travellers saw fit to deny him the first time round. Sure, it’s just a story, but as Lalami tells us over and again in the account, there’s really no such thing as “just” a story. In the right hands, stories have extraordinary power: to comfort, support and transform.
