There was so much of him. He lived the lives of many men called Ted Hughes. Driven, all of them, by a core of energy so bright and fierce it burned out many of those he encountered. By the time he reached manhood, he had, fully developed, an appetite, even a greed, above all a relentless questing passion for the life of passion itself which he sought and fed with poetry, sex and transformative mysticism about the earth and its meaning. Sometimes jubilant, sometimes tormented. He had a compulsion, which seemed to him to be mysterious, to confess and describe everything that claimed his concentration. And at whatever the cost. 
 As a boy in Yorkshire on the moors he saw the cruelty of animals, and with his idolised 10-years -older brother, Gerald, was himself unafraid to shoot, to trap fish and skin them. From his family and their friends’ lacerated feelings in the first world war, he knew about the cruelty of man to man. From his always vast reading he absorbed the violence of society. 
 But he also saw birds and fish which he studied with such delight that he could attempt to become them. The Hawk in the Rain, his first famous poem, was admired and published by TS Eliot. It was as if he had been given a poetic papal blessing. As he grew older and the rod replaced the gun, he embarked on his most constant and lasting love affair – fishing – all over the world. The wilder the seas and the rivers the better. He believed in the White Goddess of Robert Graves and the psychoanalytic types of Jung and the immeasurable profundity of Shakespeare, and drew them as deeply as possible into the metronome of his own mind. 
 His sister Olwyn – his first and perhaps his fiercest possessive woman (who became his literary agent) – passed on to him her belief in astrology which became part of his everyday life. 
 Shamanism, to Ted, was as real in Swindon as it was in Central Africa. Coincidences were strung together like pearls of wisdom from that Other Place which eluded reason and ignored the enlightenment. He sought out ancient ley lines of thought and feeling. 
 He found much of this in children and one of his lifelong pursuits was to encourage children to write and learn poetry. He wrote books for them. He persuaded national newspapers to run competitions for them. Poetry, for him, was the vital link to a deeper life. 
 Ted provoked great love among many of his admirers, and particularly of course his friends. I met him with his second wife, Carol, many times and they were times of intense conversation, great laughter and some drink taken. He was an outstanding supporter of many writers he knew, including myself, and I remember times with Ted and Seamus Heaney where the deep warmth of their friendship was palpable. 
 He wrote an immense amount. Not only the poetry but prose, thousands of letters which have been compared with those of Keats, notebooks by the score – everything had to be turned into words and put down in good 1940s grammar school longhand. Despite the wide and glittering netting of sources in this book, there is still a massive amount yet to be sifted and published. 
 He arrived on the literary scene like a meteor. His second volume, Lupercal, was put alongside the truly great by the defining poetry critic of the day, Al Alvarez, here in the Observer. But soon afterwards the foreground of his life – his marriage and the end of his marriage to Sylvia Plath, and all the subsequent nomadic sex, interfered with that reputation like an overblown foreground obscuring the gem of a painting. 
 Jonathan Bate’s unauthorised biography has been denied the chance to print anything but a few lines of Hughes’s poetry, or the other material in the hands of his executors. This is a shame but Bate has seen it as a liberation. He follows the career from Yorkshire lower middle class to fishing with the Queen Mother, from the broke poet to the poet laureate, from unbearable loss to a life which could seem like that of a predatory lone wolf, to a ballast and continuity in Carol Orchard, his devoted, intelligent and strong second wife, and to the profound pleasure of discovering in his son Nick a binding love of nature and particularly of fishing. 
 This is a powerful and clarifying study, richly layered and compelling. Bate doesn’t duck the wildness, even the streak of madness, the petty scheduling of days and hours, the lunatic schemes to live in China or make money (“money is my enemy”). Ted was very often near broke after deciding to live only off his poetry. The BBC radio children’s department effectively subsidised him. He was easy to satirise but then so was one of his greatest heroes, Wordsworth. What matters is the good that remains and in both their cases there is so much that is so good. 
 Like Wordsworth, he came from a northern grammar school to Cambridge and it was there that he met Sylvia Plath, the beautiful American poet and scholar who had read the poems he had published at university and went for him the first time she saw him. This was at a party where they danced and drank and he kissed her neck and in return she bit his cheek with such force that it bled. He was the only man “huge” enough for her, she declared. She ignored the girl he had brought with him to the party. Their faithful six-year marriage in a remote elderly village in the West Country brought two children, Frieda and Nick, and between them the forging of Sylvia Plath’s greatness as a poet and Hughes’s ever-deepening trances of thought. They wrote about each other’s work. Plath went from the bright student into a stellar comparison with Emily Dickinson. After six years, he left her. Some time afterwards, she moved back to London. Her suicide took her away from Ted but he never could be taken away from her for the rest of his life. It is a fair use of a cliche to say that she haunted him. 
 He took care of her work and published it meticulously. Like the rest of the literary world, he stood back in amazement as Ariel and The Bell Jar achieved such record-shattering success. Then he stood back in horror as a brutal wing of the new uncompromising feminist movement described him as a murderer and a rapist, and destroyed as many readings as they could, as well as desecrating her grave because the word Hughes was included in her name. He was imprisoned in the simplified cell of woman-hater. No matter that she had attempted suicide before she met him and turned to others after he left her, no matter that to understand the cause of suicide demands knowledge way beyond the capacity of those who build a case on a few external circumstances and rancid prejudice. He was condemned and that has not gone away. But it never stopped him writing and in secret he began his great act of atonement. 
 He not only hid this, he found a way to intensify the passions that drove him. More writing, more women, sometimes two or even three, not knowing which to choose or why, feeling like Jonathan Swift that it was possible to love more than one woman at the same time. His partnership with Assia Wevill was again passionate but, like Sylvia, she too gassed herself, this time taking their four-year-old child with her. Or should we more correctly say murdering the child? But of course to Hughes-haters, he was the sole culprit. 
 In the light of these terrible events it is awkward, and to many I’m sure unacceptable, to say that Hughes was sought out for love every bit as much as he himself sought it. Again and again. Total passion was his only way. And when he married Carol Orchard, the passion was there too, but there was also the relief of knowing that he was with someone non-competitive, like Valerie in the life of TS Eliot, somebody who would care for him whatever. They lived in Devon. He died of cancer in London, where he’d spent much of the last three years in Brixton with his final Goddess. But Carol was there at the end. 
 Yet throughout the post-Plath years the force that fed the man took him into complex work with Peter Brook, on their co-written play Orghast, through a devastating court trial in America to defend the reputation of Sylvia Plath, and to keep near to his Yorkshire family and his two children by Plath, Frieda and Nick, to whom he became exceptionally close. Nick took his own life soon after Ted’s death. 
 En passant, he netted many of the leading European poets and brought them to England for translation and for poetry readings. He developed a complex and most fulfilling friendship with Seamus Heaney who came to him in awe and admiration. To meet, he was in every way the commanding presence in the room, any room. Switching from a demanding interiority to great laughter, to drinking, to good talk – no small talk, no gossip. Smouldering with life. 
 Towards the end he embraced the shape-changing genius of Ovid and drew the important admiration of another key critic, John Carey. Then came the great work to which he had given so much of himself over the years, Birthday Letters, which became the fastest-selling book of poetry there had ever been. Some time after it was published, Carol Orchard with her friend Matthew Evans, who published Hughes at Faber,, gave me the opportunity to go to the British Library and find and then print in the New Statesman Ted’s previously unseen poem Last Letter, the almost unbearable account of their contact on Sylvia’s last days. He tore up his shame by the roots and in public. He showed his grievous wounds and put on view the compacted impossibility of grief, love and separation. Just as I believe he helped her in her life towards writings that will last as long as the finest poetry, so she in her death gave him the keys to that kingdom. 
 When they were in Yorkshire and besotted by Emily Bront&euml;, they went across the moors to the farm said to be the original for Wuthering Heights. He Heathcliff to her Cathy. Twin stars shining and spinning together, but too singular, too fierce to be able to hold on to each other.
