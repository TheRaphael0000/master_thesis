Rochelle Monte is almost 40 and earns less than £200 a week. She is a care worker in Newcastle, visiting the homes of the frail elderly. Her lunch hour “might be a service station sandwich and a packet of crisps while she’s driving”, records Joanna Biggs with typical attentiveness. Monte, who has three children, “works 12 days and then has two days off”. But behind that solid, unforgiving routine is flux. Monte’s contract with her employer Allied Healthcare, which is owned by a private equity firm, states in crushing modern corporatese: “The company will offer you work when it is available … Your employment with us is conditional on your agreement to work flexible hours or no hours, if the work is not available … The company has no duty to provide you with any work at such times.” 
 In a Britain of zero-hours contracts and suspiciously high employment figures, of both shrivelling and bloating wages, of too much work and too little, of vibrant local enterprise and sagging national productivity, of energising immigrants and ominous foreign competition, it feels like a good time to publish a book about work. In a steadily fragmenting society, argues Biggs, “Work is now one of the ways we understand ourselves, how we give our lives meaning when religion, party politics and community fall away.” 
 But how do you write about ordinary working lives compellingly? Hearing of other people’s jobs can get boring quickly. And case studies of individuals, the sort Biggs provides here, can make respectable but inadequate social reporting: anecdotal, lacking analytical shape or narrative momentum, more admired than actually read. 
 Part of Biggs’s solution is to be crisp. Her other job – like many of the people in the book, she has more than one – is as an editor at the London Review of Books, and she writes with characteristic LRB confidence and informal pithiness. “Work has changed since the 2008 debt crisis,” she generalises early on. “The nation of shopkeepers has become a nation of disappointed bakers and momentarily cheerful hot‑dog men. The idea that good work brings a good life no longer holds.” 
 She arranges the muddle of modern British employment into appealingly neat categories, such as Selling, Serving and Entertaining. Each theme is probed through three or four loosely linked workplace portraits of a few pages each. Rather traditionally, and seemingly to suggest what the truest work is, Biggs starts with Making. She visits one of the last remaining potteries in Stoke-on-Trent, the Emma Bridgewater factory, a manufacturer of comfortingly retro ceramics which has been blessed by David Cameron, and describes a “sponge decorator” at work on commemorative mugs for a new royal baby. The decorator has been with the firm for 20 years. “She starts by nicking the rim of the mug three times with pencil and signing each piece with her initials... Sixty-eight tiny dots [are] placed by hand all over the mug... Her hands weren’t tense... Moments of concentration dissipated and returned easily; she hovered a moment before the first crown went on.” 
 Biggs’s quick eye and ease with description make her a lovely observer of artisanal, physical work. They also suit the depiction of retail jobs. A later section about the long working day of a Belfast market fishmonger flies by in an entertaining blur of stallholders’ tricks and banter with customers. Along the way, Biggs deftly incorporates chewier material about the nonsectarian nature of the local appetite for fish, and the less cheering history of fish stocks and fishing quotas. She even finds space for a brief discussion of the gentrification of urban street markets. “You know what’s wrong with this Saturday market?” says the fishmonger. “Your cupcakes at one bloody fifty each.” 
 But the book is less vivid and revealing about middle-class occupations. Biggs meets the creative director of an advertising agency, a legal aid lawyer, a company director, and the academic (and frequent LRB contributor) Marina Warner. Instead of watching them at work, Biggs mostly lets them talk. They are articulate but predictable about the problems of work-life balance, about the growing pressures and insecurity of their professions, and the quotes in the book, previously short and firmly author-directed, lengthen and lose focus. More and more, middle-class work is about meetings and typing, neither of them easy to dramatise or for writers to observe. Biggs does not quite say it, but perhaps one of the modern truths her study uncovers is that much of the work of the powerful has simply disappeared from public view. 
 The final third of the book returns to grittier jobs, and improves accordingly. Biggs talks to a 56-year-old man on Jobseeker’s Allowance who has been given a compulsory four-week “work placement” by the government, breaking up old sofas. Before becoming unemployed, he had been an architect, a sound engineer and a musician; now he is in a hot building on a rundown industrial estate, prising out upholstery staples with a screwdriver. A satire about the Victorian economy being recreated by coalition austerity would struggle to come up with a better character. 
 One reason Biggs writes sensitively about such situations is that she has been a low-status worker herself. “I had … sat on a till in WHSmith on Saturdays, stuffed envelopes … logged car crashes in a call centre,” she writes, pointedly establishing her credentials in the opening pages. She is good on the liberations as well as the oppressiveness of simple, repetitive work. “All sorts of stuff goes through your head,” a glazer at the Stoke pottery tells her. “You just go into your own world.” 
 There are not many entrepreneurs in this book; nor many trade unions with significant powers. Neither Tory evangelists for a more enterprising British workforce nor Labour advocates of a more employee-focused capitalism will feel reassured. Many of the interviewees are barely getting by and constantly thinking about money. Thanks to computer technology, and the long, slow shift since the early 1980s in the balance of power between employers and employees, the bosses in the book are all-seeing and intolerant of dissenters. Quite a few of the workers are presented anonymously; others are rebels or whistleblowers and have suffered as a consequence, Biggs notes or implies. “A month after I spoke to [Rochelle] Monte,” she writes, “she was suspended by Allied Healthcare for being a ‘safeguarding risk’.” Monte had given other interviews about her conditions of employment: “Allied Healthcare eventually revealed that they’d been unhappy that French TV had apparently filmed her washing a client’s legs.” 
 Biggs is interested in how the coercions and addictiveness of modern work can be escaped. She visits the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides and a rabbi in Manchester to explore the social and psychological consequences of religiously imposed rest. She likes what she finds: unhurried family gatherings, people sleeping rather than emailing. “Shabbat stands against the idea of... work without a free moment,” she writes. “[Shabbat] is when the parts of us worn thin by the working week are repaired.” 
 That Biggs feels it necessary to say that compartmentalising work is healthy shows how much our jobs have come to pervade us. The enormous part technology has played in this is something she mentions but does not investigate, frustratingly. Nor does she look into the link between low pay and high pay, into how the former makes the latter possible – the great taboo subject in our ever more interconnected but polarised economy. This is an impressionistic rather than argumentative or forensic book, and the potent, finely drawn impression it leaves is of workers sweating away in their own separate worlds, some happily, some not, most of them accepting of their lot. Until that changes, the bosses will be on top.
