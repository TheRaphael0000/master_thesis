With the Garnethill trilogy, her Paddy Meehan novels and now the DI Alex Morrow series, Denise Mina has established herself as one of the most interesting and uncompromising writers in the crime genre. The fifth and latest Morrow novel, Blood, Salt, Water, can only confirm her preeminence in the field. In Mina’s novels, killers are not malign geniuses but incompetent and damaged thugs, the line between innocence and victimhood is blurred, and misogyny is not a shocking abnormality but a perpetual white noise. Blood, Salt, Water begins with a flourish of defiance against the norms of the crime novel. In Helensburgh, a touristy Scottish town once the home to a quarter of the country’s millionaires, Iain Fraser, a recently released convict, murders a young woman on the orders of a local crime boss, making the “who” part of “whodunit” fairly otiose. In Glasgow, DI Morrow – whose gangster half-brother was sent to prison in a previous instalment – is investigating the disappearance of Roxanna Fuentecilla, a woman who seems to be involved with Ecuadorian money-laundering. But the connections between the murder and the disappearance are more knotty and convoluted than the reader initially suspects. 
 Mina’s descriptions of small-town Scotland in the run-up to the referendum are exquisitely precise. She captures how the artisan bread-selling returnee moaning about losing custom to Waitrose sits cheek by jowl with the chippy never-left town drug dealer. Mina catches that oppressive sense that no one can play six degrees of separation in Scotland: you always get there in less than four. There is a simmering tension surrounding the independence debate, not so much in terms of the characters’ different hopes for the outcome but in the subtle, micro-negotiations that take place as people try to fathom each other’s voting intentions. 
 Jane Austen wrote of Emma Woodhouse: “I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like”. Mina (right) shares that perverse determination, although the reader is given access to Morrow’s thoughts, and realises how conflicted she is about adopting the same offhand management techniques she smarted under herself. But the carapace remains: Morrow is peremptory and refuses to suffer fools gladly. Nevertheless, she is scrupulously honest about her own emotions and motivations, even when they cast her in a less than flattering light. Her resigned scepticism never turns into sour cynicism. 
 Over the series of DI Morrow novels, Mina has increasingly looked at the structures of crime rather than the crimes themselves. Gods and Beasts turned on communication networks; The Red Road examined how the penal system creates the criminals it is supposed to reform. Blood, Salt, Water continues this exploration. Fraser is “a passman”. 
 Although there are murders to be solved, they are the result of financial crimes. One character muses about the extent of the black economy, and the chaos that would be unleashed were it ever to be eliminated. Alexandre Dumas coined the phrase so beloved of traditional crime fiction – cherchez la femme – but Mina’s advice is always: follow the money. 
 In her moral universe, criminality is not an aberration, but the deep structure of reality. It allows her to short-circuit the conservatism that so often bedevils crime fiction in terms of narrative closure being synonymous with “catching the criminal”. She parries moral responsibility with legal culpability. In this novel, more than the others, this extends to rivalries within the police, where solving the crime is almost of lesser importance than who gets the credit for solving the crime – the credit, and the assets seized from the perpetrators. 
 The prose is studded with smart turns of phrase: eyes like oysters, a golf club “like the entrance to a high security prison in Brigadoon”, a smoker “sucking the smoke in so hard he looked as if he might swallow his own lips”. The wry smiles they provoke offset the steel-sharp vision of a psychotic society. Mina is one of the most fiercely intelligent of crime writers, and in her hands, the crime novel becomes an indictment rather than an entertainment. That the murderer we meet on the first page turns out to be one of the few characters the reader feels sympathy for is testament to how brilliantly intricate and psychologically complex her books are.
