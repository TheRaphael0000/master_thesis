The gothic is a seductive but slippery genre, as much emotion as form: you’d be hard pressed to find two academics agreeing wholly on its definition. Often, novels are claimed for the gothic because of a creaking stair or an imperilled maiden; yet true gothic lies not merely in tropes – though these are to be prized – but in an expression of transgression, madness or desire that makes the unnerved reader complicit in the tale. With the publication of Andrew Michael Hurley’s debut The Loney, every gothic bookshelf must make room for a new addition. 
 The Loney is “a wild and useless length” of the northwest English coastline to which Smith, the narrator, returns repeatedly in memory. The novel opens with the discovery of a child’s body on Coldbarrow in the bay of the Loney; evidently something nasty once happened out there in the mud. The story is disclosed in passages moving between the past and the deeper past; at all times the reader is conscious of the adult Smith as a man unable to slip the surly bonds of childhood. In that childhood, Smith and his brother Hanny are taken by their bitterly devout mother to a religious retreat overlooking the Loney. Together with a priest and sundry devotees, they are to visit a shrine in the hope of curing Hanny, who is mute. 
 The Easter rituals in which their mother trusts have a sinister quality: the hurling of stones; the burning of marzipan to represent the perfidious Judas. It all seems merely the shoring up of pebbles against a ruinous tide, for beyond the walls another cast awaits: the muddied natives of the Loney; a spiv in a Daimler; a girl in a wheelchair. The reader grows conscious of a kind of metaphysical battle taking place, with Hanny and his brother caught between the conventions of the Catholic faith and the unreasoned wildness of the natural world, with neither side plainly either wicked or good. The novel grapples with faith’s position on the borderline between reason and unreason: Smith is haunted not only by events on the Loney but by something deeper in the past, when a stint as an altar boy was overshadowed by a priest’s falling out of faith into unhappy unbelief. 
 Hurley suspends the story in a limbo between the supernatural and the merely strange: it is not clear whether the fantastic has occurred, or whether characters are mad, or which of these would be worse. Where the supernatural is most explicitly suggested (a hawthorn blooming well before its season, say), it is done almost in passing, so that one may begin to doubt one’s own experience of the novel. This putting out of a hand to tug the reader into the text is at the crux of the gothic, and is as rare as it is delicious. 
 Knowing use of form in fiction is at times looked on askance (God forbid you deploy, for example, the pathetic fallacy). But a novelist expert in form should be no less praised than a poet who knows her English sonnet from her Petrarchan, and there is such pleasure in seeing Hurley go about his craft. Defining characteristics of the gothic are wonderfully present and correct: the house falling into decrepitude; a girl’s face glimpsed at a wet window; villainy encroaching on innocence. The uncanny is handled with particular skill: Smith’s parents are known as “Mummer and Farther”, the homely endearments altered to suggest masks and isolation. Ordinary life – traffic on the North Circular, a plastic dinosaur – beomes no less unnerving than a pig’s heart falling from a hanging effigy. When horror comes, it comes late, and lightly, and is all the more shocking for it. 
 While not faultless – some passages might have been tightened by another turn of the screw – Hurley’s prose style is perfectly fitted to the form, mingling vivid descriptive phrases (“Stone walls shone like iron”) with an ear for the oddness of conversation. 
 Back in the time of the guilds, an apprentice was required to submit a masterpiece to attain the status of a master craftsman. It was not the peerless and crowning achievement of a career, but the moment he showed mastery of the craft. Well, then – here is the masterpiece by which Hurley must enter the Guild of the Gothic: it pleases me to think of his name written on some parchment scroll, alongside those of Walpole, Du Maurier, Maturin and Jackson.
