That old song “Everyone’s Gone to the Moon” turned out to be a lie. Manned spaceflight in the 1960s and 1970s quickly slipped from science fiction’s dreamed-of future into reality’s irretrievable past. Going to the moon is now something our ancestors did, not something our children are likely to do. No human has ventured further than low earth orbit for 30 years. 
 Part of the problem is that when we went to the moon what we found was profoundly unpromising: a vacuum landscape of almost unimaginable harshness, lethally hot during its fortnight-long day, appallingly cold during its fortnight-long night, blasted with radiation, dusty, parched and grey. Ian McDonald thinks it will take a thumping profit motive to make lunar colonisation even remotely conceivable, and that colonists will have to be a more hardy breed than your regular frontiersmen and women. They’ll have to reconcile themselves to life in tunnels and domes, paying for every sip of water and breath of air, the threat of death continually at their back. That McDonald is able to spin a compelling story from this unforgiving set-up is testament to his skill as a writer. 
 One of Robert A Heinlein’s better novels was his 1966 libertarian lunar utopia The Moon is a Harsh Mistress: this is rather more The Moon is a Ruthless Sociopath. It vividly dramatises just how deadly the lunar environment is. In a bravura opening scene, youngsters race naked across the lunar surface from airlock to airlock, in a kind of extremer-than-extreme-sports coming-of-age ritual. Its takes a great deal of hospitalisation and care to nurse the survivors back to health. 
 As with the physics of the environment, so with the socioeconomics of lunar life. McDonald’s world of lunar colonists is dog-eat-dog, or indeed dog-push-dog-out-of-airlock. Rival families compete to exploit lunar resources: the rich prosper and the majority poor go to the wall. Helium-3 is plentiful, and mining it provides cheap energy for Moon and Earth both. Five family-owned corporations, or “dragons”, dominate, and although they operate within the law, they are all mafia-style organisations. Lunar law is rather looser than earthly varieties: lawyers challenge other lawyers to to-the-death physical combat in open court, possession is much more than nine-tenths of the law, and a general frontier town ethos obtains. 
 The story largely concerns the powerful Corta family, originally from Brazil, ruled by the fierce but dying matriarch Adriana Corta. Her first-born son and heir, Rafa Corta, is a hothead, the Sonny Corleone of the novel; his younger brother Lucas, calmer and a better tactician, is more Michael Corleone. The Cortas are effectively at war with the “Mackenzie Metals” family, originally from New Zealand. After somebody tries to assassinate Rafa with a cyberengineered fly, and when the Cortas snatch a lucrative new mining property from under the noses of the Mackenzies, matters heat up fast. There’s a lot of intrigue, some violence, rather more sex – healthily polymorphous and energetic, this – and all the pleasures of a cut-throat soap opera in space: a sort of Moon-Dome Dallas. 
 The book’s weakest portion is its rather clogged opening, where McDonald hurriedly introduces us to a dozen main characters and several dozen minor ones, and generally sets up the parameters of his world. It is to his credit that his future moon is dominated by the heritages of the global south rather than being any kind of implausible white-western enclave; but this does add a second layer of unfamiliarity. Glossaries help the plodding reader decipher the Portuguese, Chinese, Hawaiian and other terminology, and a multiple-page dramatis personae is there for the “Wait, who is she again?” moments. But perseverance is richly rewarded. Once the reader has oriented herself, she will shoot through the rest of the book – pages flying, hurtling towards a brilliantly tense and readable denouement. I turned the last page gasping to read the second volume of McDonald’s dyad, out next year. 
 The Godfather movies are great to watch, but you wouldn’t want to live there. One thing Luna does exceptionally well is to puncture Old Heinlein’s assumption that a frontier society based on the primacy of the family and a disregard of conventional laws would end up like idealised smalltown America. Luna argues that any realistic future colonisation of the moon will be much more The Sopranos than The Waltons. Luna is as gripping as it is colourful, and as colourful as it is nasty. As I was reading it, news came through that CBS are developing it for TV. I really hope this comes off: it would make splendid, space-age Game of Thrones -style entertainment. A Game of Moons, if you will. Play it to win, or die.
