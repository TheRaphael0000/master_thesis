During publicity interviews for the recent BBC TV adaptation of Wolf Hall, Mark Rylance joked that the codpieces weren’t big enough. US co-production sensibilities, he hinted, required the gentlemen’s appendages to be “tucked away”. This was strenuously denied – there had been no codpiece memo from PBS, apparently – yet critics couldn’t help noticing that all the male characters were discreetly treated in the groin area. Even Damian Lewis, who as Henry VIII might have been expected to sport a giant phallus to emphasise the priapic gusts on which the plot turns, appeared to favour a series of tunics that reached coyly to his knees. 
 But a quick flip through Fashioning the Body makes you realise just how big the codpieces could have been, if the programme makers had wanted to go in that direction. By the 1530s, the decade in which Wolf Hall is mostly set, there was absolutely no subtlety on the subject. Codpieces (from “cod”, the old English word for scrotum) had become so large that it was impossible for men to bend over to pull on their shoes. This might not matter much if you had people to do that sort of thing for you, but it inconvenienced peasants and labourers, who, surprisingly, were also keen on turning their genitalia into a metaphor of dominance and control. 
 This makes Fashioning the Body sound like a rough draft for Carry On Henry. In fact, it is a collection of scholarly essays written to accompany an exhibition of the same name in Paris in 2013 and that will be mounted again at the Bard Center, New York from next week. We may not have the original artefacts in front of us, but we can marvel at 200 sumptuous photographs of all those waist-squeezing stays, bum-plumping bustles and chest-expanding doublets with which we have contrived to redraw ourselves down the ages. 
 No sooner had codpieces reached their most gargantuan proportions than they were at risk of bursting under their own pretentions. Not for nothing did Montaigne call them silly and even worse, a kind of “falsehood and imposture”. Yet just 250 years later – a mere blink compared with the millennia it takes to produce a permanent swerve in the body’s skeleton – they were back in fashion. In the Regency period, skintight trousers for men were teamed with narrow coats (rather than Henrician puffed shoulders and barrel chests) to create a long, lean line broken by a wide buttoned flap that puckered and pouched much like an impromptu codpiece. The effect was to draw attention to the phallus while nonchalantly pretending that it was the last thing on your mind. 
 Now, 200 years on, we havesomething called shapewear, which comprises not just the obvious waist-pinching, bottom-lifting contraptions for women, but also men’s underpants with padded crotch. The idea is to fashion a discreet bulge under skinny jeans. This, says editor Denis Bruna, is a reaction to the baggy, falling-down aesthetic of five years ago, which made young men look as though they were wearing nappies or even skirts. 
 When Henry’s daughter Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1559, it was obvious that a British monarch could no longer rely on donning a giant codpiece or blustery doublet to get her own way. Instead, Elizabeth Regina would subdue northern barons and pushy Spaniards alike with the sheer force of her will. A large white ruff served to sever her head from her body, while simultaneously pooling it in refracted light. Not only did this remind everyone that, while she might have the body of a weak and feeble woman, she had the brain of a Tudor fox, it also hinted to troublemakers how easy it would be to park the symbolism and slice off heads for real. 
 Unlike the codpiece, the ruff remained an elite item of clothing. There really was no point in trying to wear one in a turnip field, especially in England, where the damp climate made it wilt in moments. Hours of skilled goffering were required to keep its complicated architecture stiff and radiant, and the message soon became clear: the frillier and whiter your ruff, the more you were spending on laundry. 
 Of course, there’s nothing particularly new about the idea of people displaying their wealth by wearing fiddly or fancy clothes. What interests the contributors to Fashioning the Body is the physical and mental disciplines that these outlandish new silhouettes imposed. The 16th-century ruff, for instance, forced you to be stiff-necked, while the whale-boned corsets of the following century obliged you to stand to attention in a way that seemed straightlaced to more febrile souls. Meanwhile, under the aegis of Louis XV, gentlemen’s coats were cut in such a way that the buttocks were thrust upwards and outwards, as if inviting the hoi polloi to kiss the court’s collective arse. 
 Manipulating what amounted to heavy machinery became a test of agility and, by extension, breeding, too. The wide pannier skirts of the first half of the 18th century required careful manoeuvring if you weren’t to send small dogs and knick-knacks flying. Meanwhile, the huge shoe buckles that men sported at this time necessitated a curious, wide-legged cowboy gait in order to avoid cutting their own ankles to ribbons (passers-by simply learned to keep their distance). 
 It isn’t only the aristocratic body that has a history of contorting itself into strange shapes and even stiffer interactions with the rest of the world. In the 1850s, it was the thoroughly bourgeois crinoline that held sway across Europe. Sometimes reaching a circumference of 9ft, its effect was to ensure that no man walking down the street with his wife could get close enough to easily hold her arm. Likewise, a young man hoping for a kiss from his sweetheart would find himself obliged to lean so far forward that he was in danger of toppling before their lips could meet. Here, suggest the historians of Fashioning the Body, may well be the origin of the 19th century’s famous dislike of public displays of affection. It wasn’t that the Victorians didn’t feel, they simply couldn’t reach.
