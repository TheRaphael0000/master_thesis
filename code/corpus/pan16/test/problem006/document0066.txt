If you mention the word wine to most people, it will probably conjure up images of merriment: wining and dining, wine, women and song. Wine o’clock. For some reason that sense of fun rarely translates into books on wine. They tend to be as dry as chablis. That’s not to say wine enthusiasts don’t have a sense of humour – say “Carignan Camping” to one and he’ll be in stitches – but wine jokes do tend to be rather specialised. 
 Before attempting any funny stuff, it’s best to have a basic knowledge of the subject, and two good introductions have been launched this year. From wine merchants Berry Bros & Rudd comes Exploring and Tasting Wine. There used to be a rule that all new wine books must have an introduction by Hugh Johnson, but here they’ve broken with tradition and instead have one by Emma Thompson. Also non-traditional is the way the book is ordered by grape variety with rather clever bullseye graphs to illustrate flavour. There are also essays by Berry’s buyers and exam questions at the end of each chapter, just like in 1066 and All That (though not as funny). 
 The American contender is Wine Folly(Michael Joseph) by Madeline Puckette and Justin Hammack. Like the Berry Bros book, it’s packed with graphics to make wine tasting and appreciation easier to understand. Graphics are clearly the latest thing because, also from America, there is A Visual Guide to Drink (Avery) by a group called Pop Chart Lab. The striking images range from the conventional – a wine map of France – to the more niche, such as a spider diagram of American malt liquor brands. All of these illustrated books manage to enlighten without patronising or oversimplifying. 
 Once you’ve passed the beginner’s stage you can move on to A Natural History of Wine (Yale), a collection of essays by Ian Tattersall and Rob Desale looking at the intersection between science and wine. I must admit that some of them had me scratching my head like a not very bright chimp. Others, however, are a delight. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on phylloxera, the bug that almost wiped out wine; how ethanol affects the brain; and a non-sensationalist look at the impact global warming might have on wine. 
 Nowadays most questions can be answered using Google, but when I was a wine merchant in the 90s, and was having an argument about whether red Sancerre was made from pinot noir or cabernet franc, there was only one thing to do: ask Jancis. The fourth edition of The Oxford Companion to Wine, by Jancis Robinson and Julia Harding, has just been published. It’s 10 years since the last edition and much has changed. New countries have emerged on to the international wine scene: Turkey, Croatia and China. Wine tastes are different, too – lighter, fresher – and alcohol levels are coming down. Written with authority, and sometimes a humour so sly you have to do a double take, this is still the best place to turn for answers to all your wine queries. 
 One of the new entries in the Oxford Companion is for “en rama” (literally meaning “on the branch” or raw) sherry, an unprocessed and unfiltered wine. This new style (or some would say return to an old style) has proved popular among the bright young things of London and New York. Talia Baiocchi’s Sherry: A Modern Guide to the Wine World’s Best-Kept Secret Jacqui Small) at first glance seems aimed squarely at this hipster crowd. It is artfully illustrated and contains recipes for sherry cocktails, but it’s more thoughtful than that. Baiocchi cuts through the mystical waffle that surrounds sherry without losing sight of the romance. She has an ear for striking phrases, such as a particularly old palo cortado smelling of “dark alleys and crime”. 
 The other drink that has become trendy in recent years is gin. I thought I’d reached peak gin when I received a press release last month about one flavoured with asparagus, so was surprised to enjoy Aaron Knoll’s Gin: The Art and Craft of the Artisan Revival (acqui Small), which combines history, science and a gazetteer of brands new and old. 
 London is once again a centre of drink production, with seven gin distilleries and breweries of all sizes as well as eccentrics dabbling in alcoholic alchemy. One such person is chemistry graduate Ruth Ball, whose Rebellious Spirits: The Illicit History of Booze in Britain (Eliott and Thompson) is full of great stories about the sordid and often lethal business of illegal alcohol. Such was the shortage of legal alcohol during the second world war that even top hotels resorted to buying dodgy liquor. In May 1942, “four company directors were paralysed after just one small whisky and soda at a London hotel” – or so they claimed. 
 Finally, a book which shows that alcohol and laughter can make great bedfellows. Drinking For Chaps: How to Choose One’s Booze (Kye), by wine writer Olly Smith and the Chap magazine founder Gustav Temple, masquerades as an introduction to booze appreciation, but really it’s an excuse for some inspired silliness. Tackling such important issues as whether it’s ever acceptable to wear a fez while drinking cocktails, it’s best read when slightly drunk. I can offer no higher praise.
