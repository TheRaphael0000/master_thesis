The title of Jonathan Coe’s 11th novel is, of course, the official home of the chancellor of the exchequer. It is also a bus route that makes a complete journey around Birmingham’s outer circle, providing a haven for those who might not want to go home because, for example, they can’t afford to put the heating on. On top of this, it’s the putative lowest level in an obscenely extravagant multi-storey basement planned by a super-rich Chelsea family. “What is the lady of the house going to put there?” asks Rachel, recently appointed tutor to the Gunns’ twin daughters. “Nothing,” replies the harassed project manager, thinking of the palm trees he has to transport to a subterranean swimming pool. “She can’t think of anything she wants it for.” 
 Number 11 is also a sequel, of sorts, to Coe’s 1994 novel, What a Carve Up!, the monstrously funny satire-cum-farce about the monstrously terrible Winshaw family, whose lust for power took them into virtually every aspect of British life: the media, the arms trade, agriculture and food production, the health service, the art world. Many of them were savagely disposed of at the close of What a Carve Up!, but the dynasty proves to be hydra-headed, its remnants demonstrating here that they are every bit as rapacious and brutal as their predecessors. Their depredations are smoothly updated to reflect a contemporary setting: reality television, the profitable mopping-up after overseas conflict, highly efficient tax avoidance, the exploitation of migrant workers. 
 But this is not a straightforward second act, as the notebook of a deceased cultural historian suggests. Roger, a specialist in “paranoid fiction”, dismisses the idea that a schlocky Loch Ness Monster movie entitled What a Whopper is really a sequel to the 1961 film What a Carve Up! simply because two of the same actors are in it, but not before it has prompted an interesting train of thought: “Sequels which are not really sequels. Sequels where the relationship to the original is oblique, slippery.” 
 Roger has died in bizarre circumstances while pursuing an obsession (a familiar enough predicament for a Coe character); hunting down the print of a short film, The Crystal Garden, that he remembers – or thinks he remembers – seeing on television as a child, in which a young boy comes across a magical walled garden filled with crystallised flowers and fountains. All he can really swear to is “an atmosphere, a feeling”, but it transpires that the film does exist, an interstitial filler excised from a long-forgotten TV schedule. His widow suspects his quest to have been motivated by the wish to return to life in the 1960s and 70s: “For Roger, it was about welfarism, and having a safety net, and above all … not being so weighed down by choice all the time, I suppose. He hated choice.” 
 To Laura, there is something disturbingly passive about that worldview, and about the trust it placed in the political classes: “Life’s not like that. In fact it gets less and less like that all the time.” No surprise, then, that she later joins, albeit a little sheepishly, the Institute of Quality Valuation, formed to quantify the “hedonic value” to the country of such apparently intangible pleasures as looking at a beautiful stretch of coastline. 
 Coe’s targets are clear. In the new world order, there is no welfarism, no safety net. There is no trusting the political elites. The novel, constructed in five parts that shift focus but maintain throughout a steady state-of-the-nation gaze, opens in 2003, shortly after the death of David Kelly; Rachel, then 10 years old, is visiting her grandparents, and is struck by the extremity of their reaction, how they convey to her “that this was not an ordinary death, that it would have consequences, send ripples of unease and mistrust throughout the country. That Britain would be a different place from now on: unquiet, haunted.” 
 A few years later, and their fears have been realised, although the rot, surely, set in long ago. Now, food banks stud England’s green and pleasant land, while its citizens take to social media to pour their bile on to hapless non-celebrities forced to eat insects live on television; the actual celebrities are youngsters so poorly educated that they don’t know the connection between the moon and the tides; satire is dispensed by a series of identikit standup comedians, all of them “young, tousled, slightly overweight white men wearing loose brightly coloured shirts untucked at the trouser”. 
 This last description is furnished by one of Coe’s narrative alter egos, the determinedly intellectual detective Nathan Pilbeam, who solves one case after reading a piece by James Meek about the bedroom tax in the London Review of Books. Coe’s version of the rightwing press is embodied by Josephine Winshaw-Eaves, scourge of “a malignant, amorphous monster called the ‘left-liberal establishment’”. She wages war on an enemy she can’t quite name, “a slippery, evasive nexus of institutions, made up of grant-awarding bodies, human rights organisations, legal advice services, NGOs, certain branches of the Church of England and the judiciary and, of course, hovering over it all, more powerful, more insidious, more venomous than any other public body in the kingdom, the British Broadcasting Corporation itself”. Fortunate, then, that she finds herself a flesh-and-blood version of that staple of reactionary terror, a one-legged black lesbian. Even better when Alison, the target in question, carelessly defrauds the benefits system by selling some of her anti-austerity art. 
 Angry, bleak, preoccupied with establishing occult power connections to the extent that it would easily earn its place on a shelf of “paranoid fiction”, Number 11 is undoubtedly a political novel. It is also an interrogation of the purposes and efficacy of humour in exposing society’s ills, and a spoof on horror B-movies (its deus ex machina comes in the form of giant spiders). What a Carve Up! took one such film as its artistic wellspring; here, though, that honour might be said to be split between an imaginary film, The Crystal Garden, and a real one, Death Line (1974), briefly mentioned in the book. In the latter, survivors of a Victorian railway disaster have bred in London’s underground system and now periodically emerge to snatch unsuspecting passengers for food. What do they cry, when they are finally stopped in their tracks? A horribly distorted “Mind the Doors”, of course.
