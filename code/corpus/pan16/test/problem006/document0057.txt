Jill Alexander Essbaum’s first novel has a pretty cover, its title embroidered in crimson silk on a background of delicate pewter flowers. Look closer, though, and among the twirling stems you’ll find the outline of a broken glass, petals giving way to shards, a jagged edge where there should be a dusty stamen. Hausfrau: suddenly, the word sounds more than usually weighted, a 21st-century piece of casual sarcasm thickening into something sharp and venomous. 
 Essbaum’s publisher likens her novel to Madame Bovary, and it isn’t difficult to see what brought on such fate-tempting chutzpah. When the book opens, Anna Benz, whose story Hausfrau tells, appears to be suffering from precisely the same flavour of domestic ennui as Flaubert’s great creation. Her gilded life in Dietlikon, a quiet suburb of Zurich, has infected her with a powerful listlessness, a blankness, that she is unable to shake off even in the bed of her latest lover. But here the comparisons with Bovary must end. Zurich might well have, as it does in Anna’s telling, a conservative streak as wide as the lake at whose tip it stands. All the same, its conventions are hardly those of the 19th century. The tightly circumscribed world Anna inhabits seems to the reader to be entirely of her own making, though whether she can help this is another matter. When does ennui become despair? Not even Anna’s shrink, Doktor Messerli, seems to know the answer to this question. 
 Anna (her name is perhaps a nod to Tolstoy) is American. Her husband, Bruno, is a Swiss banker. They have three children: two school-age boys, Charles and Victor, whom she finds hard to love, and a baby girl, Polly. Living nearby is Bruno’s distant, disapproving mother, Ursula; her late husband was the pastor of the church whose bells punctuate Anna’s endless days and nights. The family has been living in Zurich for several years, but Anna has never worked, nor made any real friends, nor bothered to learn Swiss German. Until now, that is. When first we meet her, she has signed up for language lessons. Among her fellow students is Archie, a Scot who sells fine whisky to discerning Zurich shoppers. All it takes is a look. No sooner is school out than Anna is having sex with him. 
 The reader gathers that this is not unusual: Archie isn’t the first man she has picked up in Zurich, and he won’t be the last. “Anna loved and didn’t love sex,” writes Essbaum in a passage that is typically ambivalent. “Anna needed and didn’t need it. Her relationship with sex was a convoluted partnership that rose from both her passivity and an unassailable desire to be distracted.” 
 Like a slow-moving bagatelle ball, Anna moves from the schoolroom to Archie’s bed to Doktor Messerli’s office and back again, over and over. There is a certain efficiency to this perpetual motion – Zurich’s smooth-running trams are ever her friend – but none of it brings her any relief. In Dietlikon, she takes receipt of her children from Ursula, painfully aware of her mother-in-law’s gaze, and yet somehow immune to it, unashamed. She will not knuckle down, and yet acquiescence is all that she is. If Bruno is largely an absence – one of the problems of the novel is that we never find out enough about him to understand why Anna feels their marriage to be a failure – then Ursula’s watchful presence ensures that the reader knows long before Anna that a calamity is surely coming. The only question is: what form will it take? Will it be enough to wake her, or will it destroy her altogether? 
 I can already hear the reaction some readers will have to this book: I just didn’t like the characters, they will cry, plaintively. Well, let them. Hausfrau is sometimes ponderous, and its imagery rather laboured: one of Anna’s ex-lovers, for instance, is a pyrologist, while in her German lessons she considers her tenses and wonders: “When is the past ever perfect?” (Grammar is often made to work like this in the novel.) There is a little too much tourist-guide information to Zurich, and most of its characters are mere ciphers. But in spite of all this, it succeeds. It is that impossible thing: a page-turner about depression. I admired its cool, European tone; its refusal to evince any anxiety at all about “privilege”; its equivocation about pretty much everything save for the Swiss national character (the book is determined, in the most un-modern way imaginable, to pin that to the page). Most of all, I liked the fact that Essbaum gives us no sweeteners in the matter of Anna’s character. She is difficult. She is boring. She is narcissistic. She is so very sad.
