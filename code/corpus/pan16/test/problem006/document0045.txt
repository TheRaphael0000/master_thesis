Magnus Mills has a reputation for great originality. His first novel, The Restraint of Beasts, in which two men erect high-tensile fences across a bog, set the tone and was shortlisted for the Booker in 1998. So unconcerned was the work with anything conventionally considered reader-friendly that the suspicion set in that Mills, famously a bus driver but less well known as a columnist, was some kind of existential genius. Since then, reviewers have invoked Beckett, though noted the absence of ontological incandescence; cited Kafka, but without the political insurrection. Mervyn Peake, minus the magnification; dehydrated Pinter; Stoppard that won’t soar … This is not to slight Mills – quite the opposite – but to point to a peculiar quality in his work, which summons up such names while steadfastly rejecting the grandiloquence of their underlying artistic agendas. 
 When I read The Scheme for Full Employment (Mills’s fourth novel, about van drivers ferrying spare van parts around) I assumed it was some kind of sub-Orwellian allegory written in the 1950s. The Field of the Cloth of Gold, Mill’s eighth novel, feels very similar. We are firmly in allegory territory again. “The Great Field” is “bounded in the east, south and west by water”. To the north lies wilderness. “For a select few … it was the chosen field: the place where momentous events would unfold and come to fruition.” When the unnamed narrator arrives with his tent, only Hen is there – “he occupied the extreme western margins”. In the south-east, there is the impression of another pitch – the owner of which, Thomas, returns, wearing druidical flowing white robes. Isabella comes next, pitching in the far east and defiantly swimming naked in the river; her tent is crimson and the narrator “liked to imagine it was lined with cloth of gold”. They are followed by Hartopp and Brigant, who settles grumpily near the wilderness and begins “making reference to the ‘lower field’ and the ‘upper field’ as though the Great Field was somehow divided into two halves’ and “hardship and discomfort were the sole preserve of the north”. 
 By now, you will be getting the idea. Soon enough, a ruthlessly organised group arrive – first an advance party led by Julian, which disappears, followed, after an interval, by “a huge assembly” all “clad in buff-coloured tunics”. Mills never makes it explicit, but he might as well: these guys are quasi-Romans – Julius Caesar’s first invasion (55BC) followed by Claudius’s arrival and takeover (AD43). And thus the allegory declares itself: the Great Field is Britain. (So no mention of the 1520 meeting of Henry VIII and Francis I at the actual Field of the Cloth of Gold in France.) 
 All enjoyable enough – but on this evidence, Mills is not quite the original his champions claim. He uses the same structural storytelling techniques that everyone else does: inciting incidents, the arousal of curiosity through partial revelation, unresolved attraction and conflict and so on. Meanwhile, there is the antiquarian prose style, which hopes to transmit humour but is in danger of slumping into pastiche: “whether this presaged good or ill was far less certain”. Then there is the issue of the faux-naive narrator and the emotional cauterisation of all the characters – none of whom has an inner life. That is part of the joke, maybe; but at the expense, I feel, of the work as a whole, which without such human interest becomes a bit pat. 
 Helped by the narrator, the quasi-Romans build a giant turf wall, to defend against the north. Next come quasi-Viking “raiders” with “long, narrow sailing boats” who fight and party raucously all night. By the end, there is a large town in the south east and a mysterious “ragged fellow” who speaks in riddles and eventually becomes so important to the king and queen that edicts are passed in his name. Thus Christianity enters the field. 
 What seems to be happening here is that Mills’ diffident stylistic and aesthetic tendencies are working against the bold vitality of his free-thinking intellectual reach. In one way, The Field of the Cloth of Gold is a meditation on immigration and the contrast between conservative ideas of preservation and progressive ideas of integration. But this is at odds with Mills’s fondness for anti-psychology and the minor amusements of deliberately mundane dialogue. Similarly, the seemingly radical originality turns out to reveal a gentle conservative of the John Major “long shadows on cricket grounds” stripe. The novel is fond of moments such as: “All round us was peace and tranquillity and, as summer rolled on, a sense of timelessness descended over the field.” And the narrator is nothing if not a one-nation fellow, who sees the exchange of biscuits as a way of “reducing the sense of division”. You only have to think of, say, Golding’s Lord of the Flies or Coetzee’s Waiting for the Barbarians to realise what allegorical writing is capable of and how limited Mills is choosing to make things.
