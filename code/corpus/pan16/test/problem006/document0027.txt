Over the past decade, one particular work by the Japanese cartoonist Junji Itō kept popping up on blogs and message boards, bootlegged by amateur translators. Often, it would come with a warning. The premise of The Enigma of Amigara Fault was odd, a little unnerving, not exactly terrifying: after a massive earthquake, authorities find human-shaped openings lining the new landscape. Fascinated onlookers start squeezing inside the holes, desperate to find one that will fit them. The Enigma of Amigara Fault ends abruptly, with the implication that it could have gone on for dozens of pages more. It haunted her, a friend told me, because it captured “the horror of being alive … where most horror stories would end at death, he keeps his characters in the hell of surviving.” 
 Itō’s work has enjoyed a murky fame outside Japan since the early 2000s, even before there was much of an infrastructure for North American manga publishing. Viz Media did bring over his series Uzumaki, about a city intricately cursed by symbols of spirals, which read a little like a Tales from the Crypt story scripted by Vladimir Nabokov. The images were bizarre: a teenage girl grows a haircut of hypnotic coils, her teacher becomes a humanoid snail, and eyes pinwheel through faces. But Itō’s notoriety was more aesthetic than commercial; Dark Horse Comics gave up on licensing his work after three volumes in 2006. The new Viz collection Fragments of Horror is not only his first English-language book since then – it brings together the only horror comics he’s published in the past eight years anywhere. In the afterword, Itō writes: “I was doing plenty of work on illustrations and manga about cats or about society, but even taking that into account, the time seems too empty … I feel like I wasted a whole lot of time.” 
 The comics in Fragments of Horror were drawn for Nemuki+, a supernatural-themed magazine aimed at young women which was revived two years ago. And unlike the abstract or inhuman evils of previous Itō stories – Uzumaki’s spirals, Gyo ’s fish springing ravenously from the ocean – the heroes and monsters here both tend to be female. In one panel of Blackbird, a birdlike woman hovers over the stricken protagonist, feeding him from her mouth. Wooden Spirit takes place at a historic house tended by a young girl and her divorced father. When a stranger named Ms Kino shows up, Dad is all too happy to provide a tour, a room and then, a wedding ring. But Ms Kino really desires their marital bed itself: “The walls … this pillar … they’re very sexy. And I can feel a masculine strength in the joists in the ceiling.” At the end of the story, as the demonic house opens dozens of eyes, they find Ms Kino’s oaken effigy clinging to a rafter, rigid with bliss. 
 Unless you count that house, Itō’s men are all feckless, faithless, or blandly conniving. They only come alive through communion with the grotesque. Those monstrous women almost always prevail, amoral and resplendent, their male casualties unmourned. Sometimes Itō toys with horror cliches about corrupting femininity directly: “I want your beautiful head for my collection,” goes the come-on to one bad boyfriend. The witch tormenting a young man in Futon turns out to be a product of guilty infidelity and psychoactive fungus, his own misogynist hallucination. Everyone around her considers the cadaver-obsessed title character of Dissection-chan a sociopath with a scalpel fetish, yet the surreal final twist undermines their neat division between human and specimen. 
 Like HP Lovecraft, Fragments of Horror presents society as a tissue stretched over roiling chaos. But while Lovecraft’s existential glower is bound up with his white supremacism – the chisel-lipped Yankees of his fiction are forever losing their minds to exotic and alien beings – Itō watches at a remove, enthralled yet ambivalent. 
 Itō reveres the cartoonist Kazuo Umezu, whose 1970s horror series The Drifting Classroom strands several dozen schoolchildren in a brutal dystopia and leaves them to adapt. But, the critic Joe McCulloch emails me: “Umezu tends to focus on the lusts and consumption of the adult world as a corrupting force – he’s more political, I think, much more overtly confrontational and eccentric, while Itō is generally pretty focused on delivering thrills and drawing weird stuff.” There’s a century-old Japanese cultural movement that revels in decadence and aberration, a sibling of Edgar Allan Poe and Grand Guignol, known as ero-guro (“erotic grotesque nonsense”). The literary scholar Jim Reichert argues that these works often had a vision of deviance “simultaneously celebratory and alarmist”, reflecting the authoritarian politics of 1930s Japan. Itō makes more concessions to popular taste than the average guro artist – he has drawn official Pokemon art – but his horror sometimes assumes a similarly gleeful tone. “I can imagine a dickish connoisseur calling him ‘ guro for squares,’” McCulloch jokes. 
 The penultimate comic in Fragments of Horror is a black comedy about commercial imperatives. A young devotee goes to meet a cult novelist, and wants to know: “Where do you get your ideas?” The answer, our fangirl soon discovers, is: “From all the deranged prisoners I keep locked in my dungeon.” Maybe it’s because the novelist is very obviously Itō’s own self-parody, but I took her as an antihero – the camp writer literally torturing eccentricities out of people. Forced to join them, the heroine vows to remain absolutely still, freezing her into an arresting pose. Her last gruesome expression, with its turgid eyes, its crevassed skin, the tongue inching out like a slug, incongruously reminded me of the Mad magazine illustrator Basil Wolverton. He specialized in caricatures so ugly they look like rock formations. 
 But Itō’s style tends to strip away any hint of realism. He likes to gawk at things beyond comprehension.
