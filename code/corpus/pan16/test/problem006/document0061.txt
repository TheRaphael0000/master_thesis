I remember the eureka moment when I realised, on my nth reading of Persuasion, that there was something truly unusual about Mary Musgrove, the wonderfully moany and insensitive sister of the heroine, Anne Elliot. Of course! She is the only married woman in all Austen’s novels to call her husband by his first name. The first time is when he proposes to leave her behind with their injured child to go out to dinner. “Oh! No, indeed, Charles, I cannot bear to have you go away. Only think if anything should happen?” She calls him “Charles” throughout the novel – and always to contradict him. He calls her “Mary” – and invariably to tell her she is wrong about something. A modern couple. 
 Their wrangling familiarity is enacted in their use of each other’s names, for these are powerful properties in Austen’s novels. Margaret Doody is surely right to argue in her new study of the topic that Austen was minutely attentive to the naming of her characters, for names matter very much to her characters. In Pride and Prejudice Mr Darcy celebrates Elizabeth’s acceptance of his second proposal by finally using her first name: “dearest, loveliest Elizabeth”. In Emma, Mr Knightley asks the heroine whether, since they are now engaged, she might call him “George”. Her reply playfully parodies the proprieties of the day. “Impossible! – I never can call you any thing but ‘Mr Knightley’.” 
 “The question of naming brings out a poetic complexity in Austen,” Doody says. She has mined into every name of person or place to create a huge compendium of the etymologies and associations on which she believes the novelist was drawing. She does not just analyse the ways in which names announce pretension, as with Augusta Elton (n&eacute;e Hawkins) and her sister Selina, now married to Mr Suckling of Maple Grove. She treats Austen’s names as if they have inherent properties. The heroine of Northanger Abbey, Catherine Morland, is so called because “her family needs ‘more land’ ”. Frederick Wentworth, at first rejected by Anne in Persuasion, “went, but he was worth something. And Old English weorth means ‘valiant’ as well as ‘worthy’ ”. 
 Doody’s method is incontrovertible, for when names do not fit they are judged brilliantly ironical. Edward Ferrars, the hampered and eventually disinherited object of Elinor Dashwood’s affection in Sense and Sensibility, has a royal Saxon name: “Ead-ward = ‘riches’ + ‘guardian’ ”. “It is an ironic name for shy Mr Ferrars, who has no riches to guard.” No denying it – though sometimes her incessant etymologies seem to confuse even the critic herself. Jane Fairfax apparently has an Anglo-Saxon name “meaning ‘fair-headed’ (faeger + feax)”. “It is odd that the young woman bearing this surname should be so noticeably dark-haired.” 
 The name-sourcing takes on the energy of free association. Mr Darcy, we can all agree, behaves rudely at the Meryton assembly ball near the beginning of Pride and Prejudice. Professor Doody reveals that his behaviour “is rather like that of the ‘bear’ ( ours ) on which the French place ‘Arcy’ is supposedly based. His name almost sounds and looks like ‘dark’ (some suppose the name to be based on Erse terms for ‘dark’, O Dorchaidhe). A dark and glamorous bear wanders into a ballroom”. Quite an image. 
 It is true that Austen does sometimes use names to signal nice ironies. Frank Churchill, in Emma, acts out the unstuffy candour conveyed by his first name, but is in fact thoroughly Machiavellian. Yet what matters more than the inherent properties of names are the ways in which they are used by Austen’s characters. Are nicknames, for instance, “vulgar”, as Doody seems to suppose? In the case of “Nancy” (really Anne) Steele in Sense and Sensibility, perhaps. “Fanny” (Frances) Dashwood? Maybe. But what about Fanny Price? Or Mr Bennet’s habit of calling his favourite daughter “Lizzie”? The point is that the use of a nickname supposes familiarity and fondness. Admiral Croft’s habit of calling his wife “Sophy” (while she calls him “my dear Admiral”) tells us of his openness and affection. When Mr John Dashwood addresses his wife as “Fanny” (while she calls him “Mr Dashwood”) we hear that he is fondly in thrall to a calculating monster. 
 Some first names do seem mysteriously to condemn their bearers. There is usually something wrong with a Mary (Bennet, Crawford, Musgrove), while you will scour Austen’s novels in vain for an admirable John (Thorpe, Dashwood, Willoughby, Yates, and even Knightley – Emma’s ill-tempered brother-in-law). Doody thinks that all the characters sharing a Christian name must, perforce, share distinctive qualities. She strains to make Henry Tilney much like Henry Crawford. “Both sometimes use their wit for the mockery of women.” She could have made it even tougher for herself by remembering that fussy, witless Mr Woodhouse is also called “Henry”. She convinces herself that Anne Elliot shares some qualities with Anne De Bourgh and Anne Steele: they “are both beginning to wither on the vine – as Anne Elliot is doing”. 
 She is also convinced that every name used by Austen brings with it a freight of historical associations. The Dashwoods in Sense and Sensibility share their surname with the infamous 18th-century libertine Sir Francis Dashwood, which somehow gives the novel “a certain spicy resonance”. “Ironically,” she adds, “the sins of these Dashwoods are not so sensational.” Or you might say that the coincidence of names means nothing. Mr Collins, she notes, has the same surname as the reputedly atheistic 18th-century philosopher Anthony Collins: “It may have amused Austen to give the name of this most notorious freethinker to her starched, ignorant, and sycophantic clergyman.” Either Doody finds a connection – or the lack of connection is even more telling. 
 She does the same thing with places. If Taunton is mentioned (in Persuasion ) then this “can stir memories of the Bloody Assizes”, where Judge Jeffreys condemned to death the rebels against James II. Yet it is difficult to see what this has to do with the journey to the town of Sir Walter Elliot’s cunning lawyer Mr Shepherd, scouting out a likely tenant for Kellynch Hall. She gives gazetteer-type descriptions of the real counties and towns that feature in Austen’s novels, as if all the details of the history and their geographical features were being invoked by the novelist. She relishes the local histories, such as Camden’s Britannica, compiled by antiquaries in the 17th and 18th centuries – works that Austen might (or might well not) have read – and imitates their assemblies of miscellaneous etymologies and topographical tales. 
 When she leaves the path of names she can be truly revealing. Suddenly she breaks off from a long and implausible comparison between Charles Hayter, Henrietta Musgrove’s suitor in Persuasion, and the similarly named portrait painter to describe the frequency with which Anne Elliot looks through windows in the novel. Suddenly we are on to something: that sense so brilliantly conveyed in Austen’s last novel of a world seen at one remove. But names have Doody in thrall, and soon she is back with their odd associations and ancient roots, more a besotted antiquary than a literary critic.
