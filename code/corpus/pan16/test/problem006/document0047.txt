More than a decade after he first sat down to write it, and with 1,600 pages and nearly a million words under his belt, Amitav Ghosh has concluded the Ibis trilogy, his fictional recreation of the events leading up to the first opium war of 1839-42. Its first volume, Sea of Poppies, shortlisted for the 2008 Man Booker prize, shone a spotlight on the grim details of opium production and its impact on the people of Bihar and the Bay of Bengal, most notably through the character of Deeti, widowed by her husband’s opium addiction and apparently destined to die on his funeral pyre until she escapes on board the Ibis, a former slaving schooner repurposed as a transporter of opium. River of Smoke, the second book in the series, took us to the opium’s destination, Canton, and the growing tension between the Chinese authorities and the traders. 
 In this final instalment, that tension – essentially between a state resisting an unfettered trade that has kickstarted widespread addiction in its population and a conjunction of personal and corporate interests messianically committed to the cause of free trade – culminates in full-blown conflict. Ghosh’s ambition is also to show how it redrew the map of the region, prompting, among other things, the transformation of the backwater port of Hong Kong into a globally influential centre of enterprise. 
 But neither of the previous two novels nor this one reads as a dry history lesson. By making the narrative an ensemble piece – in Flood of Fire, four characters’ stories rotate and gently converge – and by an exuberantly ingenious hotchpotch of different languages and registers, Ghosh’s story roars along, constantly flipping between high seriousness and low humour. It is simultaneously wrong-footing and delightful, riveting and diverting. 
 Its linguistic playfulness is most evident in the story that concerns Zachary Reid, a Baltimore seaman and the son of a slave and her white master, who is himself taken by all who meet him as a white man. At the beginning of Flood of Fire, Zachary finds himself paying off some debts by working as a “mystery” (craftsman) on a “budgerow” (a type of Indian river-boat) belonging to the wealthy Burnhams. In a scene somewhere between a pastiche of the 19th-century novel and a Carry On film, Mrs Burnham witnesses from a distance him vigorously polishing a belaying pin, draws an unfortunate conclusion and furnishes him with a series of terrifying pamphlets outlining the dangers of onanism; before too long, and with the help of a revealing toga party, the pair begin a highly secret and enthusiastic sexual liaison that proceeds almost entirely by euphemism. “It’s my turn now,” Mrs Burnham proclaims, “to bajow your ganta”; when she teaches Zachary the art of “chartering” (oral sex), she at first admonishes him (“Oh no, my dear, no! You are not chewing on a chichky, and nor are you angling for a cockup! Making a chutney, dear, is not a blood-sport”) and then congratulates him (“It is a wonder to me, my dear mystery, how quickly you have mastered the gamahuche!”). 
 It is a highly amusing storyline, but sex is always politics, too. Mrs Burnham’s Anglo-Indian vocab is a product of her colonial upbringing; her insistence that the lovers address each other, even in bed, as Mr Reid and Mrs Burnham is an expression of terror – not only of their adultery being exposed but also of radically upsetting established hierarchies. Meanwhile, Zachary’s proximity to the Burnhams’ wealth and power strengthens his own ambition to follow in Mr Burnham’s opium-trading footsteps. An extraordinarily vivid scene depicts his first purchase of this commodity – and marks the beginning of a long process of corruption that acts as a counterpoint to the novel’s comic feel – in a dank and dirty bazaar in the Calcutta backstreets: “Through the odour of dust and dung he recalled the perfumed scents of Mrs Burnham’s boudoir. So this was the mud in which such luxuries were rooted? The idea was strangely arousing.” 
 Zachary’s is only one viewpoint in a novel that thrives on the rapid shuffle of perspectives. We meet Shireen Modi, the widow of an opium trader who journeys, against all social propriety, from Bombay to Canton to retrieve his dues; the bankrupted former raja Neel Rattan Halder, now working for the Chinese and carefully chronicling the forays of the East India Company on Chinese territory and the failures of diplomacy to avert war; and Havildar Kesri Singh, Deeti’s brother and a sepoy in the East India Company, who despite misgivings agrees to sign up for the overseas campaign. 
 Amid the minutiae of personal dramas – a wife forced to confront, for example, the secret family maintained by her dead husband during his second life abroad, or the curious, wayward lives of expatriate drifters such as Paulette, who unexpectedly finds herself becoming a horticulturalist – Ghosh sketches the larger sweep of history. He marshals the language of tiny details, from naval and military terminology to food and clothes and interiors, from boudoir to battlefield, in order to bolster our sense of how enormous and wide-ranging were the effects of this period of history, and of the unforgiving, brutalising opium trade in particular, how greatly it shaped international relations, communities and patterns of migration. His expansive trilogy has, in fact, advanced his story by only a few years; but the ground it has covered is almost immeasurable.
