This book has a very neat conceit: in the year of the London Olympics, Ann Morgan challenged herself to read one work from each of the 196 countries of the world. It contains her bibliography, from The Patience Stone by Atiq Rahimi (Afghanistan) to The Hairdresser of Harare by Tendai Huchu (Zimbabwe) via such esoteric works as K Limakatso Kendall’s Basali! (Lesotho) and Laef Blong Mi by Sethy John Regenvanu (Vanuatu). Reading the World itself is not a discussion of the individual books – although one can find her reviews at the blog ayearofreadingtheworld.com – rather, it is a study of the idea of what Goethe called Weltliteratur. 
 It is in the nature of such cute ideas that they fray almost immediately, and part of the charm of this work is in Morgan’s exasperation and frustrations at her self-imposed challenge. The definition of a country is of course a rather arbitrary notion. Does one include Palestine or Tibet or Kurdistan? Morgan finds it difficult to source a work from South Sudan, the world’s newest “nation”, and freely admits they may have more pressing concerns than the establishment of a publishing infrastructure. Even within individual countries, the choice involves closing off possibilities rather than opening them out. For Spain, she chose the wonderful Exiled from Almost Everywhere by Juan Goytisolo. But that means foregoing Catalan SF (Alberto S&aacute;nchez Pi&ntilde;ol ’s Cold Skin ), Basque magic realism (Bernardo Atxaga ’s Obabakoak ) or Pyrenees gothic (Julio Llamazares’s The Yellow Rain ). Plurality plays out as much for small countries as for large ones. Judging the cultural temperature of the US might yield very different results if one were restricted to either Marilynne Robinson ’s Lila or Stephenie Meyer ’s Twilight series. Morgan, by the way, chose American Gods by the British Neil Gaiman, in a nicely thrawn fashion, and Caryl Lewis’s Martha, Jack and Shanco for the UK – translated from Welsh by Gwen Davies. 
 Morgan covers the “landscape” of global literature, the state of publishing (inevitably including the rise of self-publishing, censorship, and the opportunities and problems created by the internet), the difficulties of predominantly oral cultures being reflected in print or e-versions, the politics of translation and how the west is represented in non-occidental literatures. It is a vast field but the breezy style, infectious enthusiasm and nicely pitched tone mean it is both diverting and illuminating. That one might take issue with some of the conclusions or presuppositions is in the nature of the beast. 
 If there were one phrase it was in my power to excise from all discourse about books it is “I couldn’t identify with …” Part of reading – and Morgan does have a section on literature and empathy – is, to use a cliche, putting oneself in someone else’s shoes. But in this globe-trotting survey there is a problematic itch about the process of creative sympathy. There have, no doubt, been books in which the author tries to capture the essence, the quiddity, the uniqueness of their country, but reading as if a book can give us special insight into that country is a different matter. There is a dastardly kind of literary tourism that supposes reading Carlos Fuentes or Malcolm Lowry is the same as going to Mexico; that reading Carlos Gamerro is essentially inhabiting Argentina by proxy and even reading Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London gives the reader the experience of poverty. 
 Goethe’s idea of Weltliteratur was opposed to parochialism, to the quaint local detail, to what Thomas Carlyle damned as the kleinstadtisch, the smalltown-ishness. No work of literature has ever been lauded and praised and influential and progressive just because it was set in a particular place or time. It requires more – be it narrative sophistication, moral ambiguity, psychological acuity or aesthetic innovation – than just plagiarising a few toothsome specifics from reality. This dilemma is at the root of the least convincing of Morgan’s chapters. Sometimes literature is difficult. It’s usually difficult because being human in this surreal reality is not easy. When she writes “Just like some postmodern western works, these stories are spoiling for a fight, bristling in the red corner, just waiting for us to make the mistake of trying to pin them down. They want to break us …”, it is curious that Morgan imagines postmodernism (or the avant garde, or the experimental) as some kind of macho square-go with the reader as masochist. I’ve always found such works – challenging, fractious, ear-wormy, disorienting – the reason why I read at all and find such joy in it. A book is a little thing that is bigger on the inside, and makes the reader bigger inside as well, a Tardis of ink and glue and paper and words. 
 Translation is also underworked in Reading the World. The usual quotes – “what gets lost”, “ traduttore, traditore ”, “pitiful expedient” – get trotted out. Sometimes translations are better than the originals. When Anthea Bell decided to call one character in an Asterix book Getafix, not Panoramix, or changed Id&eacute;afix to Dogmatix, she put in better jokes than Ren&eacute; Goscinny. The way in which a writer such as Ngugi wa Thiong’o can find a use for English – he imagines it as a kind of Language Cloud, where writers who have Kikiyu, though no Swahili, but do have English, can meet with writers who have Swahili and English but no Kikiyu, so that a Kikiyu to Swahili translation might be formed – is humbling. 
 Presumptuously, I’d suggest a new project for Morgan: a “year of reading canonically”. Her vim and wit would be ideally suited to a year reading or rereading Homer, Virgil, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Goethe, Pu Songling, Sterne, Hugo, Melville, Dostoyevsky, and on. Maybe even in different translations, where, when and if necessary. 
 Reading the World begins with a self-hating slap (why are only 3% of books published in the US and UK translated works?) then wriggles towards a compromise (hey, we all have to choose what to read). Every contribution to the totality of interpretations is a good thing. I doubt I will ever read some things she has read – but I’m reminded of an Oxford don, who on being asked if he had read all the books in his study, replied: “Well, I know what’s in them.”
