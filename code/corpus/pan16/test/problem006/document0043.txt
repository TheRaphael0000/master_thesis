Shakespeare is the gift that goes on giving. Almost 400 years after his death in Stratford, aged 52, his life and work continue to mesmerise actors and scholars, screenwriters and playgoers, with that mysterious Shakespearean double helix: the bewitching braid of poetry and plot that has become part of our cultural DNA. 
 And then there’s the man. Part of Shakespeare’s fascination lies in that tantalising gap between life and work in which the plays are as resplendently present in the world as their author is shadowy and absent. This conundrum is also the source of many deranged fantasies – was it Marlowe, Oxford or Bacon? – about who wrote Shakespeare. 
 James Shapiro, a renowned Columbia University professor, has devoted his life to all these themes. Ten years ago, he published 1599, a prize-winning account of Shakespeare’s annus mirabilis, analysing the momentous year in which the poet wrote Henry V, As You Like It and Julius Caesar, and also began work on Hamlet. Shapiro demonstrated that, by paying attention to the interaction of play text and historical context, we could make important discoveries about Shakespeare’s creative process. 
 But 1599 is not the only high point in Shakespeare’s CV. 1610/11 ( The Winter’s Tale, Cymbeline and The Tempest ) is another. Before that sign-off, there’s 1605/06, famous for the gunpowder plot and its bloody aftermath, a moment when historical drama and dramatic history seem to compete with each other in extremes of threat, conspiracy and terror. This has become Shapiro’s latest subject, a darker sequel to his 1599. 
 An extraordinary year began in the autumn of 1605 when Shakespeare, who was always on the hunt for new material, picked up a newly published play-script at his local bookseller’s, a half-forgotten Elizabethan play, The True Chronicle History of King Leir. The timing and context of this purchase is vital. James VI of Scotland had just become James I of England, but not yet Great Britain, a radical concept the new king was struggling to sell to his people. The hot topic at court and at Westminster was Scottish-English relations, with many arguments about “the division of the kingdom”. 
 Shapiro shows how, in transforming an old play with a happy ending into The Tragedy of King Lear, Shakespeare not only articulated the perils of separation, but also conceived a new drama that reflected the teeming anxieties of post-Elizabethan England. Slicing away the elements of the old script that were not theatrical, and interweaving the subsidiary Gloucester-Edmund-Edgar plot, filched from Sir Philip Sidney’s Arcadia, Shakespeare fashioned his greatest play (some would say the greatest English play ever written), the supreme example of his mature style. 
 So far, so very bardish. All the evidence suggests that Shakespeare was a highly organised writer who liked to eschew metropolitan distractions and get on with the job for his company, the King’s Men. But then, just as he was getting to grips with his version of the Lear story, a drama rooted in pre-Christian British history, the Jacobean settlement was plunged into crisis. On 5 November 1605, acting on a tip-off, King James’s men discovered a suspicious-looking trooper calling himself “John Johnson” in the cellars under the Houses of Parliament. He was carrying fuses; nearby were 36 barrels of gunpowder. 
 Once the defiant “Johnson”, broken by torture, was exposed as English Catholic mercenary Guido Fawkes, the full horror of this life-and-death plot must have chilled Shakespeare to the marrow. Few prominent men in Jacobean England were more intricately linked than the poet to those implicated in the gunpowder plot. This, as Shapiro brilliantly explains, was essentially a Midlands conspiracy driven by men, many of whom lived in Warwickshire, and who were also related to Shakespeare’s maternal family, the Ardens. 
 Shakespeare would never explicitly address this trauma in his work, but Shapiro believes that, in the writing of King Lear, there are crucial moments when the shock of the gunpowder plot finds an echo in some famous lines. There is, for instance, Lear’s raging at the storm on the heath: 
 You sulphurous and thought-executing fires, Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts, Singe my white head… 
 It’s no stretch to see how these lines were inspired by the fears of what might have happened on 5 November, a day of communal deliverance on which, as Shapiro nicely puts it, “nothing actually happened”. Throughout 1606, this prototype of the terrorist threat, to which our world has become accustomed, continued to reverberate in Shakespeare’s mind. He would ask the questions that still torment us. How can ordinary people contemplate such unthinkable crimes? In doing so, what kind of stories must such people tell themselves? Does this evil come from satanic forces, or from deep within ourselves? 
 Having completed King Lear, and still writing at top speed, Shakespeare now began work on Macbeth. This time he would not flinch from the new king’s paranoia: James I was obsessed with witchcraft. Although Shakespeare, recently made a groom of the chamber, was now a member of James’s court, Macbeth would open with a dramatisation of the king’s darkest, most potent fantasies in the chanting of the three weird sisters: 
 When shall we three meet again? In thunder, lightning, or in rain? 
 Although James had survived numerous assassination attempts, Shakespeare chose to build a headlong descent into regal paranoia round the bloody murder of old King Duncan. 
 Some say that Macbeth was written to recommend the playwright and his players to the new regime. Shapiro, for whom the play is “a tragedy fixated on regicide and its repercussions”, takes the opposite view. “If Shakespeare wanted to flatter his monarch,” he writes, “there were easier and more remunerative ways to do so.” Instead, he plunges his audience into the new world of “equivocation”, a Jacobean buzzword, and the disturbing concept of “the fiend that lies like truth”. 
 According to Shapiro, there was a new culture of suspicion in London in the aftermath of the gunpowder plot, the effects of which were irreversible. One of Macbeth ’s deepest insights is that in such a poisonous climate – medieval Scotland or Jacobean London – the good, and the evil, have to embrace “equivocation” to survive. There had been no explosive cataclysm on 5 November 1605 but – perhaps this is why we nurture the date with “remember, remember” – something had changed irrevocably in the culture, a shift registered in Macbeth. Nothing would be the same again. After 1599, there was a return to innocence and a kind of uneasy equilibrium. After 1606, the long slide towards the civil war begins. 
 Historians tend to identify the tipping point in the failure of the Jacobean settlement with the 1615 Overbury scandal. Shapiro puts it differently. Londoners who saw Macbeth in the spring of 1606, passing beneath the severed heads of traitors on their way home from the Globe, would have recognised, but dared not say, that their Scots king had unleashed a kind of Scottish hell in London. 
 1606 is not all fire and brimstone. Professor Shapiro’s dark, enthralling, and brilliant narrative includes a nice aside in which he reveals that the age-old thespian fuss about “the Scottish play” was actually a Victorian invention, the work of the incomparable Max Beerbohm.
