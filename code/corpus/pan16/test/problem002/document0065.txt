Of course we older people are lonelier than we were in youth and middle age. We are simply less connected; we do not have that major resource of sociality, the workplace. We are less engaged; we lack the energy – and abilities – that are required for social activities. We are less involved; we are no longer a major cog in our family machine. 
 We are, first and foremost, sociable creatures; that is our genius. Loneliness describes a state in which such sociability has become less attainable. And old age makes this inevitable. It is a biological given. It is as much part of the life cycle as incontinence. 
 So of course we are lonely. The longer we live, the fewer our peers. We lack connection, engagement, acknowledgment, because we are no longer useful – or rather, we don't make ourselves useful. We have a reduced aptitude to contribute, to perform, to do. And that's life, for heaven's sake. We knew it was coming; we knew we'd get weaker, with less energy, less puff, less competence, and we also knew that with that decline in utility would come a decline in social access. 
 We need a new mindset, a new crumblie paradigm, with renunciation as our order of service, compliance rather than concessions, permission not permits, grace not favours. I am not suggesting gerontal teams painting the Forth bridge or Methuselah squads picking up dog mess, but there are many ways in which we can remain socially connected through backup roles in the workplace, while contributing to the improvement of the society from which we have so richly benefited – and hoping to attract the timely attention of the reaper. 
 There are plenty of old people who do understand this; you will find them working in charity – and mainstream – shops, taking town walks, delivering newspapers, generally helping out in repairing the social cloth that the fit and able are busy protecting and extending. In other words, they are taking part, rather than leading sheltered lives. 
 There is one type of institution that, probably more than any other, both owes its survival to, and offers, camaraderie to elderly people: religious organisations, such as the Church of England. Within their walls, their grey congregations are companionably employed. And there are endless other voluntary opportunities as yet unfulfilled, in which the grandparental qualities of patience, experience, calmness, slowness are needed, uch as mentoring, Home-Start, Sure Start, respite care for adopting and fostering families, schools reading programmes – a whole range of pastoral support services, which our national directors are busy demolishing. These not only offer an antidote to the scourge of loneliness and provide a social increment in the process; they can render the eighth age economically proportionate. 
 Above all, such engagement in the public domain will expose us to infections and exhaustion, which will enable us naturally "to cease upon the midnight", possibly with less pain, probably less lonely and certainly with less expense.
