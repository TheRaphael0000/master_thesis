There will be sore heads tomorrow at the Institute of Fundraising's annual convention , following tonight's convention party. There always are: fundraisers know how to put on a good bash and the event is justly renowned. 
 But many at this year's party will have special reason to celebrate. For the government's headlong retreat on its budget plan to cap charitable tax reliefs has lifted a dark cloud that for 10 weeks hung over the heads of big-gift fundraisers as their wealthy clientele pondered whether to put away their cheque books. 
 Voluntary sector leaders can still scarcely believe their luck. Although the sector put up a solid public front in arguing for the plan to be dropped, as it ultimately was amid a flurry of budget U-turns , the picture behind the scenes was less united. The institute itself offered a compromise that would have exempted donors from the proposed cap only if they passed up their own tax reclaim to the charity receiving the tax-deductible gift. 
 As Karl Wilding, head of policy at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations has now acknowledged, the sector was scratching round for evidence to justify continuation of uncapped reliefs. And "an awful lot" of charities thought it wrong to campaign to keep them, he told a conference last week. Some member organisations even told the NCVO to desist. 
 The truth is that there is considerable discomfort in the sector at the exposure of a system by which rich people appear able to dictate how their contributions to the common good are spent – getting out of paying taxes for (state) schools and hospitals by electing to donate to projects of their choice, which very often will be in the arts or higher education rather than in general social welfare. 
 There will be similar discomfort now among charities and other not-for-profit groups that have benefited from the largesse of Barclays. The troubled banking group has given good support to credit unions and grassroots sports organisations , to pick just two areas it has got behind, and last year it says it generated "community investment" amounting to £63.5m. But recipients will not exactly be rushing to put the group's logo on their stationery. 
 All this reflects the fact that charities can today rely much less than before on two traditional sources of funds: old-fashioned tin-rattling and statutory grants. And there is another tricky consequence: the growing dependence on contract income. Is there a ready alternative for the charity with a conscience? Not obviously. The best advice would seem to be to sup with a long spoon.
