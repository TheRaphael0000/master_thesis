Let me to introduce you to the Barnet Graph of Doom. It's a PowerPoint slide showing that within 20 years, unless things change dramatically, the north London council will be unable to provide any services except adult social care and children's services. No libraries, no parks, no leisure centres – not even bin collections. 
 Barnet, once dubbed "easyCouncil", is known for its enthusiastic embrace of service outsourcing. But the Graph of Doom is quite separate. Irrespective of savings planned under the One Barnet transformation strategy, the slide demonstrates that demographic change – more children, more older people – is going to soak up every penny the authority has. 
 As Nick Walkley, the council's chief executive, puts it: "In five to seven years we get to the point where it starts to restrict our ability to do anything very much else. Over a 20-year period, unless there was really radical corrective action, adult social care and children's services would need to take up the totality of our existing budget." 
 The slide is used to focus the thoughts of his colleagues and councillors. But it now features regularly in presentations by Sir Bob Kerslake, permanent secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government and head of the home civil service. Whether he has dared show it to communities secretary Eric Pickles, defender of the Englishman's inalienable right to a weekly bin round, is unknown. 
 The graph should not be taken too literally: by making no provision for Barnet's anticipated rise in income through regeneration schemes, for instance, it overstates the bleakness of the outlook. But as an illustrative device, it is hugely effective. 
 In having to plan for population growth at both ends of the age spectrum – 17% more children aged five to nine and 25% more people over 90 by 2016 – Barnet is experiencing a relatively large dose of the same pressures being felt by all councils. So the government's failure to take a lead on reform of funding of adult social care, reform that would ease the pressure on councils, is unforgivably short-sighted. 
 We already knew the forthcoming social care white paper would not address the funding issue, but would be accompanied by a "progress report" on the official response to recommendations of the Dilnot commission, which proposed a reformed system. Dumping dismay upon disappointment, last week's Queen's speech revealed that even the white paper's largely legal changes would not be legislated upon in the next session of parliament, breaching previous assurances. Only a draft bill would be prepared. 
 Putting the sunniest possible interpretation on this, a wild optimist might think that the delayed bill will at least be able to incorporate any positive outcome of the cross-party talks on funding reform that are under way beneath a cloak of secrecy. But grounds for optimism are scarce. 
 Interviewed on BBC radio, Lord Warner, the former Labour health minister who sat on the Dilnot commission, diagnosed paralysis on the issue: the Treasury had taken fright at the £1.7bn (and rising) cost of implementing the commission's ideas, he said, with the government more widely running scared of admitting that, to pay for care and support, older people with the means to do so would have to "use more of their windfall housing assets and give up some of their other benefits". 
 The cross-party talks, involving health ministers and their shadows, needed to be "upped" to the level of the prime minister and chancellor and their Labour and Liberal Democrat equivalents, Warner concluded. That is surely right. And if they do ever sit down together, the Barnet Graph of Doom should be displayed throughout.
