The dispute over the future of Botton village , a rural community in the North Yorkshire Moors where volunteers live and work side by side with learning disabled residents, providing round-the-clock care, has reached an impasse. Two ongoing legal cases are considering whether the charity that manages the village has breached the residents’ human rights and its own founding principles. 
 The charity in question, the Camphill Village Trust (CVT), is attempting to convert all volunteers into paid employees. The decision follows concerns about the safeguarding of vulnerable adults at the site and irregularities in bookkeeping, but campaigners against the change say it is also an attack on the founding principles of the village and the social values that keep the community together. 
 The volunteers, known as co-workers, are refusing to leave the homes they share with learning disabled residents who they take care of and support. As the two sides await the final hearings, an injunction prevents the charity from making further changes to the co-workers’ living arrangements. In return, co-workers have agreed to become temporary members of staff for an interim period. CVT says this is necessary to keep the taxman off their back. 
 The case is complicated, bewildering even, but it could have wider significance for the care system and how it serves vulnerable and profoundly disabled people. 
 Green MP Caroline Lucas has tabled an early day motion on the matter, which states her concern over the distress caused by the “loss of the residents’ chosen lifestyle” if the village becomes a residential home rather than a volunteer-led community. 
 The case echoes similar arguments as to whether the disability charity Scope is right to shut down large residential homes and help its clients to integrate into the wider community instead. The charity and many of its supporters say this is a progressive response to budget cuts and also reflects our modern understanding of care and safeguarding for vulnerable people. Closing down institutions and helping people to live independently, providing the support they need to function in society while retaining their own private home, is the ambition of many disabled people and their friends and families. 
 As many as 2,300 individuals with autism or severe learning disabilities are still incarcerated in secure hospitals, often without family approval and miles away from home, for the safety of themselves or others. The learning disablity charity Mencap says this places them at risk of abuse and deterioration of their condition as highlighted by the abuse uncovered at Winterbourne View. 
 Families, such as the parents of Connor Sparrowhawk , who drowned in the bath in a specialist NHS inpatient unit in Oxford in 2013, have been fighting hard to see relatives cared for nearer to them, or in their own homes.. 
 The Care Act is designed to provide independence alongside the protection vulnerable people require when they rely on others to cater for their basic needs. But there is a danger that safeguarding and protection can become a mere box-ticking exercise rather than promoting choice in the care system. 
 Friends and relatives of the residents due to be moved out of Scope’s homes are angry. They feel the choice of continued care in the place where their loved ones are already settled – an option which should still be open – has been snatched from them and that independent living will not be suitable for some. 
 Families and residents in Botton feel similarly: they are concerned that a particular lifestyle – the recreation of a family life in a loving home environment – will be lost for good if co-workers are forced to become paid staff members with regular shift patterns, no longer able to share a home with learning disabled residents. Safeguarding may be simpler, but the specific choice of care that residents or their families made will be removed without consent. 
 The real tragedy is the distress that both cases have caused to residents. A survey carried out by Scope in 2013 found that 40% of disabled people living independently did not receive the basic care they needed, such as washing, dressing or getting out of the house. 
 Modernising the care system is essential, but it should not be tantamount to homogenisation, with care provision reduced to a simple formula, which suits almost nobody. Where changes must be made – and progressive care means they must – putting the wishes of disabled people and their families first, and not the vested interests of charitable organisations or their staff or volunteers, must be the starting point.
