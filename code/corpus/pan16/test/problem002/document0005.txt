Innovation is crucial for the future of the NHS. We have got to find ways to achieve better health outcomes for patients with relatively less resource. With rising demand from an ageing population, higher expectations from better-informed health consumers, and changes in technology, innovation is the key to raising quality and efficiency. 
 There are three stages to getting innovation mainstreamed across the NHS. First is demonstrating that innovation produces better outcomes, second is achieving a critical mass of health professionals using it and third is getting its complete adoption by the health service. 
 The NHS is good at "proof of concept", but it is not so good at adoption. Various organisations have been charged with spreading innovation, such as the modernisation agency and the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement , but we've not quite cracked it. 
 One example is bar coding for blood products. In 2000, a company developed bar coding, which enables patients' blood types to be matched more accurately with the blood available for a transfusion. It was developed in Doncaster Royal Infirmary and the John Radcliffe hospital. They clearly demonstrated how this technique reduced the risk of mistransfusions. But despite the "proof of concept", it took so long to be adopted across the NHS that the original company went bust. Now, more than a decade later, bar coding is finally becoming common practice using newer technology, but those barriers to adoption shouldn't have existed. They included the time and cost of two hospitals rolling out the technique to another 200-odd hospitals, and suspicion of the company's profit motive. There is also an ingrained attitude in the NHS that "it doesn't really matter if I'm not using the latest technology or the most up-to-date management technique". 
 I believe the way to promote innovation is to get NHS organisations to have a vested commercial interest in it. If a hospital, or a team of clinicians or managers, receives a financial return for developing a product or technique that is going to save the NHS millions of pounds, perhaps they will have more incentive for developing and spreading it. To help encourage this practice, the NHS Confederation will soon be launching an Equity Innovation Fund to promote joint ventures and encourage more entrepreneurism in our health service. And I'm not just talking about inventing the next cutting-edge gadget; it could be developing a new approach to delivering existing services. 
 Awards that showcase and profile innovation also play an important role in spreading new practices and ideas. They communicate good practice, not just to health professionals, but crucially among consumers. If patients and their carers become aware of an innovation in one hospital, that can generate customer demand for the same innovation to be introduced in their hospital. 
 A programme in the north-west called Advancing Quality introduced a bundle of basic care interventions for patients admitted for conditions such as pneumonia or heart failure. It was a performance-related system because there were small financial incentives for NHS trusts that complied with the programme, but it was driven less by money and more by a desire for trusts to perform well against each other. By publishing the results each year, trusts could benchmark their performance. The programme was evaluated and the results, published last year, showed that there was a significant reduction in mortality for patients with those conditions in the region over a three-year period. 
 Advancing Quality was implemented by the strategic health authority, trusts and commissioners, but key was the buy-in by clinicians. The same is true for the adoption of keyhole surgery, which has a lower risk of infections and a shorter recovery time for patients. Surgeons took it up quickly and resources were put into it for training. 
 But despite its proven success, Advancing Quality has yet to be adopted across the NHS. If it had won a high-profile innovative award, maybe relatives of patients with pneumonia outside the north-west would now be demanding its introduction all over England.
