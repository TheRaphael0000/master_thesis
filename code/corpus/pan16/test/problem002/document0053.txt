In the runup to next week’s spending review, every day brings fresh evidence of the mounting crisis in social care. We’ve so far had a warning of a shortfall of 200,000 care workers by 2020 and a reminder that for all the concern over services for older people, support for people with learning disabilities is at least as big an issue for cash-strapped councils. 
 According to a new assessment by the Local Government Association (LGA), published today, councils in England spend £5.4bn – a third of all expenditure on adult social care – on learning disability and demand is rising fast. Numbers of children in special schools are forecast to increase at more than twice the rate of numbers in mainstream schools over the next five years. 
 “People rightly focus on the crisis facing services caring for the elderly,” says Izzi Seccombe, the LGA’s community wellbeing spokesperson and Conservative leader of Warwickshire county council. “But in some councils, supporting those with learning disabilities is becoming even more of a challenge than caring for our growing elderly population.” 
 The disability charity Scope said last week that 55% of disabled people who use social care services already cannot get the support they need to live independently. It described how one woman slept in her clothes in her wheelchair and quoted another who said: “I wasn’t able to get to the toilet during the day, so I had to wait from 8am sometimes until 10pm.” 
 The LGA is calling for full funding of social care in the spending review to avert further cuts. According to a new analysis by the King’s Fund thinktank, net spending on adult social care for all age groups is more than 10% lower than it was in 2009, despite rising need. If cuts continue to 2020 at the same rate, spending on social care as a percentage of GDP will have halved over a decade. “This would be an astonishing and unprecedented reduction at a time when we should be devoting a bigger share of our national wealth to our ageing population and when there are also more younger people with care and support needs,” the thinktank warns. 
 The outlook for social care is “grim”, the King’s Fund says, and the evidence for such a verdict is piling up. A report last week by the Malnutrition Taskforce, a campaign group, highlighted data showing that the number of people in England receiving meals on wheels fell by more than half in the four years to 2013-14. 
 Yesterday’s workforce study by the charity Independent Age and the ageing issues thinktank ILC-UK says there must be urgent action, and funding, both to attract more UK workers into social care and to make it easier to recruit from overseas. More than 230,000 existing care workers in England, almost one in five, were born outside the UK, the study estimates. In Greater London, that proportion rises to almost three in five. 
 In the absence of care services, meanwhile, a growing burden is falling on unpaid carers. New calculations for the Carers UK charity by researchers at the University of Sheffield suggest that the number of people in the UK caring for a family member or friend has risen to 6.8 million, an increase of 16.5% since 2001. The value of their support is put at £132bn a year, approaching the cost of a second NHS. 
 Hel&eacute;na Herklots, the chief executive of Carers UK, says: “If even a small percentage of people were unable to continue caring, the economic impact would be catastrophic. Worryingly, we are edging towards this possibility as the pressure on families to provide more care with less support is intensifying.”
