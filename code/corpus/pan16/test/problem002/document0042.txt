There's been a bit of a ruckus at the unit. I learned about it at the community centre lunch the other day, following an unexpected comment from Cecil. 
 "Credit where it's due, those ladies did a good job." 
 Such a remark was no small tribute coming from a man whose attitude to women is what Charlie's is to the young; misogyny might be a tad harsh but there is a strong whiff of gynophobia. 
 Apparently, following a prolonged stay in hospital, a silverback resident called Oliver had returned to find that someone else had annexed his favourite chair in the common room and he had not taken kindly to it. It had taken all the negotiating skills of three of the female residents to sort it out. 
 The event coincided with a flood of public pronouncements about the implications and consequences of increased longevity. What caught my eye was the suggestion that the grey vote would result, if only indirectly, in a return to governance by elders. In other words, those seeking political power might not be old themselves, but would need to adopt increasingly elderly-friendly policies to obtain it. 
 Nothing new here, you might say, except there would be a significant gender bias. The grey vote contains a preponderance of women; old age is the one area of national, even international, life where women outnumber men. And that, surely, is a hopeful sign – remember the comment following the financial crisis that it would not have happened under the Lehman sisters. Grandmatriarchy would replace alpha male ambitions for extraterrestrial conquest with down-to-earth care for its planet home, and restore social justice to an unruly household. 
 The older I get – and it's not simply down to a testosterone deficit – the more it seems blindingly obvious that when God created man, she was only kidding, and that the human project only started in earnest with the creation of Eve. With his chronic appetite for risk and conflict, his total disinterest in housework and maintenance, Adam did not need a companion so much as a nanny who would moderate the damage his dysfunctional behaviours might do both to himself and his home. 
 It's a matter of function. Through the circumstances of their lives, women possess the social and emotional literacy for competent administration. Their experience of home economics, budgeting, conflict resolution, negotiated settlements, short- and long-term planning, material distribution, sustained and multiple project management, these skills equip them to run an orderly and equitable household – far superior to a degree in PPE from Oxford (which many also have these days). This is especially true of grandmothers, who have had a "wifetime" and a half of such experience. 
 "You're an old romantic", was my daughter's response when I floated the idea to her "and I mean old as in out of date; we sisters left the kitchen sink some decades back; we want to be making the decisions, not just voting for them." 
 Maybe she's right. All the same, it seemed to me that the portfolio of skills acquired from running the home – there's only a tiny minority of men actually doing it and the rest barely lend a finger – are what is needed at this time in our human story. We remain locked into an uber-masculine agenda which programmes humanity into conflict and degrades its planet. 
 If humanity is to have any chance of celebrating a fourth millenium, we need a new paradigm to ensure there is an inhabitable earth in which to do it. A granny state might just be the answer.
