The government has made it clear that it wants ordinary, interested citizens to take a much greater interest in the accounts of public bodies. As public sector accountants are busy finalising statutory accounts for the financial year just ended, this is a good time to ask whether all the effort, complexity and expense of producing these difficult to understand, costly to produce accounts, which are not relevant to ordinary people, is really worthwhile. 
 It is, of course, necessary for public sector bodies to produce some form of accounts, but given the substantial costs of preparing and disseminating statutory financial accounts, questions need to be asked about who uses these accounts, whether they understand the information provided and whether it gives them anything of value. The reality is that there is no evidence to suggest that these accounts are widely used or that valuable information is gleaned from them. 
 At seminars and discussions with public sector managers and accountants, I often ask them whether they have ever looked at the statutory financial accounts of their local authority or local NHS trust in a personal role – as a resident, service user or citizen – as opposed to in their professional role as a manager or an accountant. 
 Their answer is always no. Many respondents say they just do not understand the accounts. If highly trained managers and accountants cannot read these complex documents, how can we expect citizens and taxpayers to learn anything useful from them? 
 One reason for this complexity is private sector practices. Over the past few decades, accounting practices in the public sector have blindly followed practices in the private sector without any consideration of the differences between the two types of organisation and the relevance of the information provided. There seems to be an assumption that if we follow private sector practices we can't go wrong. The examples of Enron, WorldCom and various banks suggest this is a fallacy. 
 Another cause of the difficulty of understanding public sector accounts is vested professional interests. It may be to the advantage of the accounting profession and large accounting firms (which audit a large proportion of public sector accounts) to have more complex arrangements, since this strengthens their own position. 
 In an article in the Journal of Finance and Management in Public Services on statutory financial accounting in the UK public sector, I argue, along with Donald Harradine and Roger Latham from Nottingham Business School, that public sector accounts should clearly present information in which the public is really interested, such as the legality with which public funds have been used and the financial and operational viability of the organisation. We believe accounts should demonstrate clearly that public funds have been used according to plan, and have been used effectively and efficiently. 
 The government is keen that citizens and taxpayers should be able to hold public bodies to account in a more robust fashion than has previously been the case. It has required local authorities to publish details of their spending over £500 in order create an "army of citizen auditors", who would treat councils' accounts to the "sunlight of openness". However, there seems little sign yet of the armchair auditors emerging, perhaps because so much detail about public expenditure is being released that citizens just cannot understand it. What is needed instead is a set of annual financial accounts that are simple, comprehensible and enable citizens to find out the things they really need to know. 
 As George Bernard Shaw once said: "All professions are conspiracies against the laity". Isn't it time we started producing statutory financial accounts for public bodies that are relevant to, and understandable by, citizens rather than the accountants?
