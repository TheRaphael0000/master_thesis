Some 20 years after I first walked through the revolving doors of a north London psychiatric unit, it is worth looking back and considering what, if anything, might have prevented the breakdown that derailed my life so spectacularly that two decades later I cannot imagine who or what or where I might now be had it never happened. 
 These questions are not ones I think about often because, at least on a personal level, it seems a fairly pointless exercise. You cannot change the past. You may be able to change how you think about it, but though I’d readily acknowledge I’ve gained a great deal from my 20 years in the psychiatric system, not least the remarkable people I’ve met, I cannot but feel that it’s cost me a great deal too. 
 At a time when my friends and contemporaries were building careers, I was sitting in a hospital common room, smoking and drinking tea. When they were busy falling in love and getting married and having children, I was on medication that squashed my libido so completely it resembled a barely discernible piece of two-dimensional roadkill. My relationships suffered; very few of my friendships survived from before my breakdown. At the age of 45, I have no savings, still less a pension plan, I don’t own any property and can’t imagine that I will ever do so. 
 I’m not asking for sympathy; I’ve been far luckier than many. But I don’t think people always realise the enormous cost of mental health problems, even for those who appear to come through relatively unscathed. And the cost to society is considerable too. Mental health problems are estimated to cost the country over £100bn each year through lost working days, benefits, lost tax revenue and the cost of treatment. The cost in human terms is immeasurable. 
 So it does seem bizarre, to say the least, that figures obtained by the mental health charity, Mind, under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that local authorities in England, who since reforms in 2013 have been responsible for protecting public health, spend an average of only 1.4% of their public health budget on preventing mental health problems. The 2014-15 spending plans allocate only £40m to mental health (filed under “miscellaneous”), compared with £671m on sexual health initiatives, £160m on smoking cessation, £108m on tackling obesity and £76m on increasing physical activity. Some local authorities have no plans to spend anything at all on protecting the mental health of their residents. 
 The response to Mind’s request for information revealed confusion on the part of some local authorities as to what they were supposed to be doing to prevent mental health problems, while others appeared to be unaware they were meant to do anything. To be fair, this is hardly surprising. Documents published by the government at the time of the reforms scarcely mention mental health. A public health toolkit sent to local authorities contains “tips on chips”, and manifold suggestions for employers on improving the physical health of their workers. In 39 pages there is one single reference to mental health: a statement that regular exercise is good for physical and mental wellbeing. That’s it. 
 It is as if there is a sense of fatalism when it comes to mental health. This is closely linked to the stigma those with mental health problems face. Normal people do not break down. Those who do are “other”, different, not quite human, even. They are certainly not just ordinary people who happen to suffer from a mental illness. 
 But the truth is there is loads that can be done to help prevent mental health problems and to minimise the long-term impact when they do occur. For example, raising awareness through education, tackling stigma, dealing with stress, bullying, loneliness and isolation; giving help to deal with financial problems, benefits and housing issues, providing postnatal support; helping people to stay in work or education where possible, funding “crisis houses” as an alternative to putting people on wards. 
 Would any of this have prevented my breakdown? I cannot say for certain. But I do not doubt it would have helped.
