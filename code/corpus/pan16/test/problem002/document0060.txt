All Fools' Day marks the start of the latest NHS reforms in England. Legislation is now in place to compel embryonic GP-led clinical commissioning groups to tender the bulk of current and proposed services on the open market. So, uninformed as they are by any evidence base, the reforms may be seen as a radical experiment to reshape our health services through the use of market forces. As such they raise serious concerns â€“ one of which is my GP colleagues' inherent conflict of interest. 
 It goes without saying that local GPs should have a strong say in the design of local health services. In considering, for example, tenders for a community dementia care service, those GPs with special interest in dementia are the very people required to rigorously evaluate the submissions. But, almost by definition, their interest dictates that they, too, will have submitted a tender. They need to be present for their expertise, and to be absent because of their financial interest. 
 In the spirit of a market economy, the tendering process should drive the changes required to reform patient care, not impede them. But however hard GPs try to be impartial, where the GP commissioners are also the potential or existing GP providers of services, their decisions will affect their practices' income or outgoings, and therefore their own pockets. 
 The British Medical Journal has revealed that more than a third of GPs on the boards of clinical commissioning groups in England hold directorships or shares in private healthcare companies, exposing them to potential conflict of interest when commissioning services. 
 Pharmacy is no stranger to conflict of interest. Historically and economically, pharmacists, like GPs, have been both professionals and businessmen. A function of the independent regulator, the General Pharmaceutical Council , is to ensure an appropriate balance of the dual roles. But in the new market economy another potential conflict has arisen out of the increasing trend towards GP ownership of pharmacies, usually located in the GP practice building and a throwback to the archaic rural "dispensing doctor"' practices, whereby GPs are remunerated for the prescriptions they write. 
 The potential for financial considerations to influence prescribing, and to direct patients to the in-house pharmacy, is clear. A Chemist & Druggist magazine report this month has aired fresh doubts over the ethics of GP ownership of pharmacies, following reports from law firm Charles Russell that it has received an increasing number of allegations of GPs directing prescriptions and anti-competitive prices. 
 The British Medical Association (BMA) maintains that conflicts of interest in GP-owned pharmacies are already "closely monitored on all sides". Dr Laurence Buckman, chair of the BMA's GP committee, says: "For GPs, there is the added stipulation that failing to declare an interest when taking a prescribing decision is a GMC [General Medical Council] offence, as well as a breach of BMA guidelines." He adds: "There is no real evidence that GP pharmacies act in any different way to other pharmacies." 
 Yet the GMC has decided to revise its guidance on conflicts of interest and pharmacy ownership. David Reissner, head of healthcare at Charles Russell, welcomed the GMC's move but said if the GMC was increasingly asked to step in to address inappropriate financial conduct by GPs, "we will have to see if it is willing take action". 
 The NHS in England is to be fully exposed to the capriciousness of a market economy. This is in stark contrast to the NHS in Wales which is avoiding the marketplace and competition in favour of an integrated system, where the assets of the health service are owned by its government and its people. 
 Our journey of reform does look suspiciously like a fool's errand. Has anyone considered a straightforward nationalised, salaried health service?
