Our lunch club at the community centre is threatened with closure because of the cuts. It's there to make sure we crumblies get a healthy, affordable meal, but – and I don't mean to be ungracious – with the grim reaper hiding round every corner, for heaven's sake, bring on the sugar and salt. 
 In any case, it's not about the food or the cost. It's about belonging. I usually get together there with residents from the elderly people's unit near where I live and it's the same for them. The unit offers "sheltered" living, and the problem with sheltered living is just that – it's sheltered. Old age can be a ghetto. We all need refreshment, to get out, to breathe fresh air, see fresh faces. 
 We normally meet up on the bus to the town and, straightaway, get talking. It can get quite vigorous, and not just moaning about our afflictions, from arthritic fingers to the quality of Zimmer frames. Yes, we do mention them in passing because that's seniority life for you. Just like youngsters bang on about potholes and wheelie bins. 
 Last week, there was Chalkie, who used to be a lawyer, and Charlie who is scared of children, who are regulars, along with a couple of the ladies, Babs and Doris. They meet up with their friends, and we blokes join another table. 
 Once we get the unpleasantries out of the way, we get stuck into serious stuff. This week it's smoking. And it gets well heated. Nicole's on our table; lives on her own, a retired teacher, calls a spade a bloody shovel, a bloke in all but gender, and you take your life in your hands if you disagree with her. So we nod. Anyhow, she'd heard this stuff on the radio about the Czech government wanting to ban cigarette advertising. 
 "One of the tobacco companies did a survey, and it showed that what the government had to spend on people getting sick from smoking was peanuts compared with what they saved from people dying early." 
 Chalkie tried to put in his two pennyworth about human rights – still chasing ambulances in his head – but Nicole swept him aside. "It's all about money, right – cost-benefit they call it." 
 Scary, I thought. The same argument could be applied to our lunches: healthy diet and we'd live longer, cost more. When my daughter came round at the weekend, I told her about it and she said the problem was that we weren't citizens any more, any of us, just consumers. 
 It's looking more and more like what youngsters call a no-brainer. After all, we're high maintenance, we oldies, the only thing we consume is care and benefits and they cost too much, so … once you change people from citizens to consumers, then all the rules change; right and wrong go out of the window. 
 Still, look on the bright side, I say. Time for a menu-change – bring on the salt and sugar and we'll die younger, like the smokers. That way it will be worth their while to keep the lunch club going, in spite of the cuts, and that's what we want because it's not the food we come here for, or immortality; it's the company and the chance to have our say. OK, no one may be listening, but, I don't know, it sort of makes me feel I still belong.
