There is a thread running through the plethora of reports and resources launched this month to tackle child abuse, from the NSPCC's toolkit to assist schools in protecting pupils in abusive relationships , to Google and Microsoft's new steps to block online access to indecent images of children, and the final report of the Office of the Children's Commissioner's inquiry into child sexual exploitation in gangs. That thread continues in reports on children and young people's understanding of consent and sexual violence in gang-affected neighbourhoods in the UK, which were published this week as part of the international day to end violence against women and girls. The link is: our child protection system is failing to respond to the risks faced by teenagers. I believe this systematic barrier exists for two reasons. 
 First, our existing child protection system has been designed to assess risk within the home and a parent's capacity to safeguard their child. These latest reports make it clear that, for teenagers, risk exists in their peer groups, schools, neighbourhoods and online, and these are all harmful environments that professionals and parents struggle to tackle. 
 Theoretically, if a child is unsafe in their home, professionals take steps to make that home safe and only when this avenue has been exhausted is the child removed. And yet, I continue to be told anecdotes of girls who, having been sexually assaulted in their schools by fellow pupils, are moved to a different school for their own safety – while little is done to change the school environment itself. It seems that when teenagers have been harmed in their peer groups, schools, neighbourhoods, or online, we are reduced to moving them rather than making those spaces safe for them. 
 Second, while child protection is built to protect children from adults who seek to hurt them, this month's reports and the NPSCC toolkit indisputably demonstrate that young people are also harmed by their peers. These documents also show that professionals are struggling to identify this form of abuse and when they do it is far from clear how they are meant to respond to the child who has been harmed and the child who has caused the harm. 
 If we are truly committed to learning lessons and improving the way in which we safeguard teenagers, both of these gaps require significant attention. The MsUnderstood Partnership , which I have set up to tackle young people's experiences of gender inequality, has offered to provide support to local areas in England to improve their response to peer-on-peer abuse. To date, 38 local authorities – from rural to urban neighbourhoods – have applied for three places. Reading through the applications it is clear: professionals want support to both assess the risk posed to teenagers and to tackle abuse that takes place outside of the home. 
 When I started to look at these issues eight years ago the landscape was very different. My requests to interview young women linked to street gangs met with confusion. Child sexual exploitation was absent from the national agenda and research into teenage relationship abuse could only be found in the US. While we have clearly moved on, this month's torrent of information should now serve as a marker: a point at which we take stock of the progress that has been made, and commit to closing the gaps that remain. 
 In three years' time, I hope to see a demonstrably different approach to safeguarding vulnerable young people across England, and through the MsUnderstood Partnership, I intend to be part of this process.
