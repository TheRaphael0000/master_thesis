Simon is squeezed into a chair, trapped in the pharmacy consultation area, waiting for his prescriptions. Last year he retired from a career in teaching, and has been gaining weight ever since. He is well aware his waistline shapes his health, and believes I'm about to nag him. 
 At the beginning of the year, pharmacists, along with GPs, nurses and other health professionals, signed up to the government's Making Every Contact Count campaign. Sounding more like the exhortations of a rugby league coach, it is actually one of the NHS Future Forum proposals to reduce health inequalities. Each and every contact with the public is to be seen as an opportunity to help them improve their health. Although it is considered to be a core responsibility in the NHS , there is no funding, and the evidence base to support it is limited. 
 Nevertheless, I'm heading Simon's way. I remind him that as a non-smoker, if he were to gradually lose that abdominal fat – I've previously suggested goals at six, 12 and 18 months – the likelihood of his premature death from heart attack or stroke would plummet. Not only that, but he probably wouldn't need his considerable medications. No more physical and mental slowing down caused by beta blockers, or the disabling muscle discomfort statins can cause, or the need for antacids, laxatives and haemorrhoid treatments. In his shoes I imagine myself binning the bus pass and walking home for a salad supper. But knowledge alone seldom changes behaviour. 
 The conceptualisation of obesity as a straightforward issue of energy balance – calories in versus calories out – has been described by obesity expert Dr Harry Rutter as "seductively simple ". There may be genetic factors involved, but, either way, an individual has much less choice in the matter of their weight than is commonly assumed. 
 Supermarkets sell foods rich in salt, sugars and fats; the food and drink industry lifestyle advertising and product placements encourage ever more consumption; increasingly sedentary lifestyles and being overweight have become accepted social norms. The behavioural and environmental influences are such that it is much more likely that people gain weight than lose it. The behaviour demonstrated by Simon has been described in a Lancet editorial as "a normal response by a normal person to an abnormal environment". 
 The difficulties of choosing healthy lifestyles in deprived communities are well established. Simon enjoys a pensioned retirement, but he lives in an obesogenic environment in which the ability to exercise choice is fundamentally compromised. 
 Public health is clearly at odds with the vested interests of the food and drink industry, whose profits are fuelled by the obesity and alcohol epidemics. The impact of my targeting Simon with health promotion, or prescribing drugs to modify his fat metabolism, pales to nothing in the face of ubiquitous and malign social promotions. 
 The government's protracted emphasis on personal responsibility deflects attention from these broader determinants of health. Rather than regulating to create an environment in which individual prevention and treatment could be effective, the government actively seeks the food industry's advice in partnership arrangements. Capitalism has replaced public health advisers with corporate moguls. 
 Tax bad food, subsidise good food, and I'll have a fighting chance to make every contact count. But without social change, when I next see Simon he will probably be contributing to the diabetic epidemic, and still thinking I'm a nag.
