The year opened with a news story about Spozhmai, a 10-year-old girl apparently coerced into acting as a potential suicide bomber by her older brother in Afghanistan. Many commentators expressed their shock that not only had someone so young, and a girl, been brought into an offending network, but that the person who had done this was her brother. 
 And yet this is not an issue unique to countries such as Afghanistan. Since I began researching serious youth violence in England back in 2006, both professionals and young people have highlighted the risks posed to siblings – both of victimisation and involvement in offending. 
 In 2013, reports by the Office of the Children's Commissioner , the University of Bedfordshire, and east London-based youth charity Off-Centre , have all said that siblings of young people affected by gang and serious youth violence are at risk of victimisation and offending. 
 Alongside the one-off headlines of nine-year-olds found with guns in their bedrooms are countless other untold accounts of siblings being affected in a myriad of ways. 
 I have interviewed a sister who sought to pay off her brother's drug debts in a bid to protect him from retributive violence; boys and girls who felt coerced into providing alibis for older siblings; girls who have heard their brother attacking his partner and being too afraid to tell anyone. One 14-year-old girl told me during a project I led on the impact of serious youth violence and gangs on women and girls, "once, he gun-butted me on his way out and I felt lucky he didn't turn it around". 
 The most significant account I was ever given was from a 17-year-old, "Abi". The youngest of five children and the only girl, Abi watched each of her brothers selling drugs and using violence against boys and girls in the local area. She thought the only way to avoid being exploited by the boys she knew was to act like them. She committed street robberies and violent offences alongside her brothers from the age of nine and, while she had friends who had been murdered, and had been severely injured herself, she thought it was safer than being "one of the other girls" who were victimised by the boys around her. Not until she started offending herself did anyone intervene with Abi. 
 The lack of interventions for siblings has always confused me – after all, whenever I speak to professionals about a young person they are working with they can always tell me how many siblings they have, their ages, and what schools they go to. However, all too often services are only commissioned to work with the young person who has come to the attention of the police or youth offending services, and not the other children in their household; girls in particular are falling under the radar. 
 Chance UK , an early intervention service for five- to 11-year-olds, recognised this when 95% of referrals to its mentoring project were for boys. Wanting to address the under-representation of girls, it developed a three-year pilot programme for girls who were siblings of gang members. It provides intensive support to 20 girls aged under 11, across two inner-city local authorities. Demand for the service continues to grow: in one case it identified a nine-year-old girl being groomed by her sister, who was already being exploited by a local street gang. 
 Providing this level of early intervention is imperative, and it begs the question that if some local authorities can offer this support to build a child's resilience and keep them safe, why can't all of them? It costs £178,000 to place a child in a secure training centre for a year, of the kind Abi was in at 17; recognition of her vulnerability coupled with early intervention could have saved significant resources and, more important, her childhood.
