The young man works at the local tyre garage. He has a typical asthmatic's prescription – bronchodilator inhalers for relief, steroid inhalers for prevention and a course of antibiotics. He tells me he doesn't need the last item. I tell him his GP thinks otherwise, but his concern is not with medical opinion, it is with economics and a prescription charge of £22.95, which I reckon to be about 10% of his weekly income. He is given an owing note for the antibiotics, in case he changes his mind, and is charged £15.30 for the inhalers. 
 Zoe is a care assistant in a local nursing home. Her prescription for antidepressants and analgesics had been written a few weeks ago. She tells me that because of the cost (from April prescription charges rose from £7.40 to £7.65 per item), she has been trying to get by without the prescription but is now at the end of her tether. Her obvious distress is not helped by my clumsy encouragement to persevere, advising her it could be another month before the antidepressants start to help. Selling her some alternative painkillers that are cheaper than a single prescription charge offers scant consolation. 
 The tyre mechanic has joined the ranks of those destined for emergency hospital admission. Zoe is a likely candidate for additional health and social support – quite a hefty price for two prescription charges. 
 Now, let's abandon the euphemism. This is not a "charge". It is a tax. It bears no relationship to the cost of the prescription. It does not specifically support the NHS. It is not a payment to the pharmacy. I am an unpaid tax collector. 
 The breach in the philosophy of free healthcare for all was first made in 1952. A tax of one shilling per prescription form was introduced to curb escalating drug costs. Its impact was minimised by innovative GPs writing in their smallest longhand to get all of a patient's medicines on a single form, creating a virtually unreadable document and a dangerously false economy. 
 Subsequent decades of tinkering has resulted in a confection of social, financial and medical exemptions , leading to the present iniquitous tax. 
 The Prescription Charges Campaign , which brings together 24 charities, has called on the government to abolish prescription charges for all patients with long-term conditions, reflecting the proposals of the 2009 independent prescription charges review. 
 An Ipsos Mori survey found that 800,000 people failed to collect a prescription during 2007 because of the cost. An Asthma UK survey in 2009 found 34% of people who have to pay for asthma medication sometimes choose not to get all their prescriptions for financial reasons. My customers are not isolated cases. Recognition that a prescription tax contributes to ill health and future health costs has led to its abolition in Wales (2007), Northern Ireland (2010) and Scotland (2011). 
 Wales's industrial past has left a legacy of chronic disease. Five years after the abolition of prescription charges, Asthma UK Cymru reports a dramatic increase in the number of patients being properly treated for respiratory disease. Abolition of prescription charges has been a major achievement of the Welsh assembly government. 
 There is a belief that the removal of the prescription tax will create a deluge of unnecessary prescriptions, and that people will swamp GP surgeries for free supplies. Yet analysis of prescribing patterns and medicine purchases in Wales before and after abolition has revealed no basis for this assumption. 
 Every day, the existence in England of the tax deprives patients of equitable healthcare: to provide that we must look to the devolved governments.
