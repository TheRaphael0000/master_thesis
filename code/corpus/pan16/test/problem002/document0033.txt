Paul Lamb is in court to ask to die. Paralysed, the physical state that – to him – makes his life unbearable is the same one that leaves him unable to end it. What added cruelty. 
 In England and Wales, it is still illegal for a doctor or loved one to assist a person to die. Lamb is trying to change that. He's taking up Tony Nicklinson's fight. The now late "locked-in syndrome" sufferer did the same last year. It's hard to remove the image of Nicklinson sobbing as he was told he had lost. There will always be people who want to die. Lamb may lose this week, but he will be replaced by another. Eventually, we're going to have to start listening to them. 
 What we hear may not sit naturally, to see sickness or pain and to be told – perhaps – the right thing is death. It would be easier if such a sentiment existed in isolation, that what people such as Lamb want could be given with no effect for the rest of us. The tricky thing is, one person's right to die seems to touch other people's lives, be it the threat of the slippery slope from euthanasia to murder, or the sense that someone is saying their own life doesn't matter. Individual choice soon bleeds into collective consequence. 
 We can hardly avoid the fear that granting the right to help someone who is vulnerable, ill and disabled to die could be twisted by doctors or relatives. But what we fear doesn't have to be tangible. Lamb, a man miserable in his disability, is begging to die. That thought isn't meant to be comfortable. For many disabled people, that discomfort goes deeper and touches a lurking fear in us: what would a law that helps people to kill themselves because of disability say about the value of our own lives? 
 What makes a life worth living is no small question. Or, indeed, when (or if) the point comes when death is preferable. The answer should be based on our own individual minds, but, right now, this isn't respected by law. 
 Lamb is in pain that no medication can lessen. It isn't my role to tell him to carry on. He's had enough. Society's task shouldn't be to ban him from making the choice of whether to live or die, but to create a system of care and support that ensures his choice is a free one. 
 As cuts trample the lives of sick and disabled people, thinking of the right to die may seem like the wrong direction. But the fight for a meaningful life, rightly grasped by activists against disability cuts, can run alongside the fight for the right to death. It must. At their core is humanity and the right to what we choose.
