I met Charlie at the bus stop the other day and his body was bristling with indignation. 
 "See, it's not his fault," he concluded after a fairly long explanation. "You don't get like that without something being wrong." 
 "That" was one of his two sons' obesity. It transpired that he had been refused a hip replacement because he was too overweight. This seemed to me a quite reasonable refusal; after all, what was the point of replacing an item of bodily equipment, the mechanical failure of which could be attributed to having too much to carry, without addressing the issue that caused the damage in the first place? 
 "And in any case, when you're too fat, there's a problem with the anaesthetic," Joyce had suggested when I mentioned it to her at the community centre. "Nobody just gets obese â€“ you make it happen, you're responsible," she said, and off she twinkled on her smug little ankles. 
 Mulling it over that evening at home, it occurred to me that Charlie's son's situation was iconic of our times. We eat, drink and make merry in the knowledge that "tomorrow" is a lot further off than it used to be, thanks to the NHS and its technologies. 
 My daughter Penny came round at the weekend and I mentioned the business. 
 "So he's overweight," she snapped. "Anybody bother to ask why?" 
 She's a bit of a leftie but then, working as she does at the sharp end of the care sector, I guess she's entitled. 
 "Look, no one wants to be obese; it's an addiction," she said. "You don't like what you see in the mirror so you look for comfort." 
 She's right, I guess. Comfort food, from burgers to coke, is big business and, in the present circumstances, comfort is in high demand. In Charlie's son's case, there was much besides. From what I'd picked up over the years, he'd not had it easy. An unhappy schooling with low-threshold special needs, a couple of redundancies, divorced; in other words, circumstances had aggravated a naturally ill-disciplined appetite into addictive mode. 
 After she'd left, however, I recalled my initial reaction to Charlie's complaint, which generated some pretty uncomfortable thoughts. Charlie's son got fat; my fellow crumblies and I have got old. Is there a difference ? I mean, if Joyce's and my argument were to become policy, then... Exactly. 
 Our need for repair derives from our lifestyles. We are products of our personal appetites and the manner in which we satisfied them, whether it took the form of indulgence in food, narcotics, work, or of abstention from exercise and attention to health. Again, we may claim that we are victims of happenstance, the normal accidents of life and vulnerable genes. But the question remains about the degree to which we are entitled to require the working young to pay for breakdown repairs of ancient errors, excesses and "events"; repairs that will amount to no more than a short-term patch-up job anyhow. 
 Such misgivings were not reassured by last night's phone call from Penny. Her car had failed its MOT. "Not worth repairing, all that rust needed welding, and something about the steering and suspension, cost more than a new car," she said. 
 She would never make the link between a commodity and a human. But I could and so, I imagine, can the politicians.
