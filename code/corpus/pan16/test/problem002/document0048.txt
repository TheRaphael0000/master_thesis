Olive is 82 years old and lives independently in sheltered accommodation. Her chronic heart and chest conditions are compounded by an ever-worsening short-term memory. She didn't know the carer putting on the kettle and preparing her medication was the second one to do so that morning. 
 Olive drank more tea, ate more toast, and then overdosed on all of her tablets. The carer realised the error when she belatedly read the medication administration sheet. She contacted the district nurse, who called the NHS non-emergency helpline, 111. 
 The call handler followed the computer generated algorithm, which recommended that an ambulance be dispatched. However, she felt this should be reviewed by a member of the clinical team – predominantly nurses, but also doctors and paramedics. 
 However, in the light of the historically high proportion of weekend and bank holiday calls associated with medication problems the local 111 service had supplemented its bank holiday team with two pharmacists. 
 So Khuram and I, resplendent in green sashes, were in the call centre, working the 8am to 4pm and 10am to 6pm shifts. Different clinicians wore different-coloured sashes to signify their role. Ours was to phone the medication-related callers back, or directly assist call handlers when requested, and to support the rest of the clinical team on medication issues. 
 To summon a pharmacist, the call handler waved a large green card. I took the call from Olive's district nurse. Olive was her usual chirpy self, her blood pressure was fine, and her son was due shortly to take her out for a family lunch. I considered the implications of each of the double doses, thought it unlikely that further harm would be done, advised that no more tablets be taken over the bank holiday, and that Olive would be better off having dinner in the care of her family rather than making a trip to A&E. 
 Khuram and I responded to an array of questions and concerns very similar to those we deal with in our conventional community pharmacist roles. The mother of a heroin addict wanted to collect more methadone for her daughter who couldn't come to the phone, but had apparently failed to get to her pharmacy before it closed for the weekend. A teenage girl had tried a range of solvents to remove glued-on eyelashes, and sought advise on how to remove the remaining eyelash, quite incidentally describing her sore and swollen eyes. A young man had persistent hiccups after his medication was changed. Babies developed high temperatures and young parents sought reassurance. It was commonplace for elderly people to leave their medication at home when away for the weekend. 
 Despite the compassion and dedication I witnessed in the call handlers, my experience is that patients seeking urgent medical advice want to speak directly to a doctor – ideally a doctor they know. So why not consider paying GPs to take back out-of-hours telephone triage? Pharmacies could be commissioned to provide out-of-hours support. A simple solution with a minimum of bureaucracy. 
 The imminent review of the 111 service, which has been beset by problems since its launch in many parts of England earlier this year, may well determine the reasons for its variability. But it is the reclamation of out-of-hours and urgent care by GPs that patients – and over-burdened A&E departments – would most welcome.
