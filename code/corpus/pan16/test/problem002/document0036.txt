I recently chanced on some news that shocked me profoundly: a senior psychologist who specialised in the treatment of women with serious emotional problems had been struck off after having an affair with a patient. Though news to me, it was not actually news – it happened several years ago and I stumbled across an old report in the course of researching something else. 
 While I was never a patient of the psychologist in question, I was assessed by him years ago for a new behavioural therapy service he was setting up. It was through this that the psychologist encountered the patient with whom he had an affair. He also admitted to a previous relationship with a patient and, according to the reports I read, police were investigating the files of seven other patients – three of whom had subsequently died – with whom he may have been sexually involved. 
 The psychologist was well known to me, even before my assessment. I would see him around the day hospital, where I was a patient, and he would sometimes attend our case reviews, big meetings where, essentially, a bunch of people you'd never met discussed the most intimate details of your life then called you in for five minutes to answer questions. The psychologist cut an imposing figure. Most of the staff at the day hospital were pretty insipid and ineffectual – or so it seems to me, looking back. At the time, the imbalance of power ensured that anyone with access to the staffroom (where our files were kept under lock and key) was automatically imbued with a certain magical aura. But the psychologist had an additional presence. He was a burly, powerful-looking man and, with his greying hair and neatly trimmed beard, he had a seasoned air about him, an impression of vast experience filtered through a kindly but unflinching intelligence; you sensed that he knew things about you that you didn't know yourself. 
 When I attended my assessment, I had been discharged from the day hospital. I'd been sectioned and had tried to kill myself, so was in a pretty poor way. The psychologist outlined the service on offer, which was fairly intensive: a mixture of group and individual treatment, several times a week for at least two years as well as telephone support. I would be able to call my psychologist, I was told, at any time. I asked if I would be able to see a woman. This was an important issue. I had always been assigned male workers – three of them, one after the other, had presided over my mental collapse. I strongly believed, and I think I was right, that I needed to talk to a woman. 
 But no, he said, I would have to see him. There were women working in the service, but he was the most experienced, and so it was him I would see. This, for me, was a deal-breaker. I said no, and so the message went back that I wasn't prepared to work with the service, and another black mark was added to my records. 
 I can't help wondering what would have happened had I said yes. Nothing, in all likelihood. I know plenty of people who've used the service and found it very helpful. But what is shockingly clear to me now is just how vulnerable I was at that time. Had he, or any other worker, wished to manipulate the situation, it would have been so terrifyingly easy for them to do so. And I am pretty near certain I would not have survived any abuse of the therapeutic boundaries. I was lucky, but others were not.
