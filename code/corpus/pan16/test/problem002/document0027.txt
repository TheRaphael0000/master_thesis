In a month where the realities of child sexual exploitation have loomed large in the public consciousness, the Office of the Children's Commissioner (OCC) report of its inquiry into child sexual exploitation last week reminded us of the importance of listening to, and taking seriously, the voices of children. In the midst of increased awareness of the abuse of children, it is critical that professionals consider what needs to be done to better protect children and implement many of the report's recommendations. 
 Many point towards police forces, children's services, health, education and other partner agencies looking for victims, rather than waiting for children to tell someone what is happening to them. While this may seem a reasonable and sensible approach to take, it is rare. 
 The way sexual violence is identified and policed in most parts of the country is that professionals wait for a complaint or allegation to be made, then it is investigated. It is rare for children who are sexually exploited to simply walk up to someone and tell them what is happening to them, particularly in the immediate aftermath of an assault. When children do tell, it can take them months, if not years, to feel able to say or even realise what is happening. Academics and organisations have consistently articulated how many sexually exploited children struggle to understand or identify that they are actually being exploited. It is unsurprising, therefore, that agencies that wait for children to talk before they act reported few or no victims of sexual exploitation in their local areas. 
 The report clearly showed that the only difference between agencies that identified hundreds of victims and agencies that identified few was that some were committed to finding victims, and others waited for victims to find them. A willingness to find crimes, in addition to investigate the ones that are reported, is a completely different method of policing sexual violence. 
 To find the victims of sexual exploitation, one has to look for the signs. Expert guidance to safeguard children from sexual exploitation, assessment of "localised grooming", and the OCC report have built up an evidence base on these signs. They include going missing repeatedly, suffering physical injuries (most frequently cigarette burns and slash wounds), misusing drugs and alcohol, being in receipt of unexplained gifts such as mobile phones, offending – alongside those who are hurting them – self-harm, and a rapid change in appearance. Professionals hold different pieces of the "warning signs" jigsaw across youth justice, education, health, children's social care, and the police, along with parents and carers. As a result, proactive investigation is the responsibility of many individuals and teams outside of, and including, the police. 
 Commitment from a range of partners to lift the stone and work together to understand and tackle all that is hidden underneath, is imperative for preventing child sexual exploitation in the long term. At the core of last week's report and the recommendations that it made was a call to change the way we think about, describe and identify sexual violence, in a way that puts children first. Listening to what they say through their behaviour, as well as their words, and taking this seriously through action is the only way to prevent the rape and abuse of children.
