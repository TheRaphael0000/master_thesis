Last week, sitting in a room of mothers, I was faced with a question: what can we do to protect our children? I was there to speak at the launch of a "mothers against gangs" initiative, and was overwhelmed to walk into a room and be surrounded by mothers and grandmothers from a range of ethnic, cultural and social backgrounds who were desperate for help. 
 Their children were being threatened by gangs, or had begun to group together, and they didn't understand why, or know how to stem the tide. They were concerned about the impact of pornography on their children, the risk of sexual exploitation, safety at school and on public transport, and the violence in their children's lives. They wanted to work in partnership with the local services, which were represented at the meeting, to keep their children safe. The mothers could see they themselves were part of the solution. 
 Also speaking at the event was a man in his 20s who during his teenage years had been involved in a street gang. He admitted using violence against rivals and being abusive in his own relationships; his friends had killed and been killed. What turned his life around? A woman in the local community, a relative of one of his friends, opened the door to him and his friends and stuck by them over the years it took to extricate themselves from the violent environment and mentality that they had become accustomed to, he explained. This single relationship with an adult who stuck by and supported him was what, he says, saved his life. 
 No one would question the importance of relationships in the lives of children as a protective factor in keeping them safe. The commitment of adults to care for and protect children is vital. But the man's tale was also woven with elements of significant risk: his family home had been attacked; the woman who was supporting him and his friends had had her livelihood threatened. It reminded me of the mothers of gang members who I had met two years earlier. Their homes had been firebombed, ransacked by drug dealers, and they had been assaulted when attempting to get their children away from the influences of older gang members. 
 Children involved in street gangs are often acutely aware of the risks to their families; especially if they want to leave the gang, or, if under pressure to join, are reluctant to get involved. Support for mothers of gang members is scarce, and generic interventions often fail to account for the real risks they face. 
 The mothers I met with last week wanted to make a difference to the lives of their children. But they were also aware of the dangers of getting involved. It is unlikely that many of those mothers were on the radar of national initiatives such as the government's troubled families programme spearheaded by Louise Casey. These mothers were responding to the impact of the risk posed outside their front doors. 
 Not all children involved with, or at risk of, street gangs have families who are trying to get them out of gangs. Some are living in homes where parents have problematic substance misuse, or are gang-associated themselves. But families raising their children in gang-affected neighbourhoods need consistent and sometimes intensive support to protect their children from harm. 
 When seeking to protect children from risks outside the home, rather than within it, are children's services and the police equipped to respond? The mothers I met are up for the challenge â€“ the question is whether services can protect them to protect their children?
