“Wicked, that’s what it is, pure evil.” Joyce, of the trim ankles and lethal backhand, has just joined us from the gym: “us” have been rather less athletically challenged, doing a spot of slo-mo yoga in one of the exercise rooms of the sports centre which has acquired a cafe extension. It offers us crumblies another watering hole. 
 Upon enquiry, it emerges that, while indulging her favoured sedentary pastime of surfing, Joyce had come across a promotional ad for some vitamin pills. She’s also a bit of a health freak so she signed up. 
 “It was just a trial offer, clear as day.” Obviously not so. The next she knew was a couple of months later when – her financial acumen being inferior to her physical condition – on checking her bank statements, she found two debits of £79 each. The Citizens Advice Bureau advised her to appeal in writing, but warned her that it was one of the more common scams. 
 Ted was predictably unsympathetic on the bus home with Oliver and myself: “Caveat emptor, it says so on the tin”, he says. A couple of days later, Oliver drops by, half agitated, half uncertain. Over a cuppa he tells me how the same sort of thing had happened to him:“Not as bad, but bloody embarrassing.” 
 Oliver is a sports fanatic but, unlike Joyce, of the armchair variety. Using text on his mobile, he’d entered a competition for free tickets to the final test match, plus “five nights in a four star, drinks, the works”. 
 What he had failed to understand was that the texts which he had received in the ensuing weeks for further competitions had all been debited to his account: “about 30 quid, I mean, you don’t have to pay for texts you receive, so…”. 
 By chance, I was at this time reviewing my energy charges, primarily at the behest of my daughter. I’d gone on these compare websites, which were great, except that I want bits of paper where I can cross refer, make notes, underline, just ruddy handle, but as she said, what I’d save on the electric, I’d use on printer ink. In the end I gave up; I might have saved a few quid but probably not. 
 And there’s that ominous phrase “conditions apply”, as my friend Pauline recently discovered to her cost, when the house she had lived in for 40 years sprang a leak. The heavy rains of last winter had worn away at the brickwork associated with the chimney. “Tough”, said the insurance company, “that’s wear and tear, your problem, it’s in the terms and conditions.” 
 Now, I know we crumblies have a reputation for grumbling, but sometimes we can see changes which you youngsters can’t. In the greater scheme of things, these little anecdotes may not amount to much but they do illustrate something which has become pervasive. 
 Our culture has become endemically dishonest. From top to bottom, from frontbench to back office, high court to low life, hedge fund to doorstep, duck house to tax haven, website to cold call, cheating has become the norm, and moral blindness is the new life skill. The scam, the sting, the blag, these are the credentials of contemporary social credit-rating. Deceit has become our default setting. 
 What intrigues me is what lies behind this. Because we are talking about a paradigm change; for millennia since Hammurabi, we have painfully, laboriously constructed codes of behaviour, which moderate the abuse by the strong and protect the interest of the weak. It is a process which attends the relative need of strangers rather than the reciprocal greed of relatives. It seeks to regulate the abuses of the snake-oil salesmen in the entrepreneurial world, abuses which have been facilitated by the vaunted connectivity of the digital revolution. 
 The social contract is being reversed. Where the expansion of citizenship constructed an ethos of mutuality, commerce has reduced us to consumer commodities to be exploited and defrauded. Dishonesty rules OK. Even Narcissus did not photoshop his selfie.
