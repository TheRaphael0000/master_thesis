In Jonathan Coe’s imminent novel, Number 11, Laura Harvey, professor of contemporary thought at University College London, writes a book called Monetizing Wonder, an attempt to assesses how films set in London – Quatermass and the Pit, Death Line – have contributed to the economic life of the capital. It brings her to the attention of the Institute of Quality Valuation, a quango working on an algorithm that can put a cash price on a folk tale, an archaeological discovery, a stretch of English coastline. She is sent north to audit the Loch Ness monster. 
 If such a body is ever established, it’s Dominic Sandbrook, visiting professor at King’s College, London, who’ll be asked to pack his bags for Inverness. “Whether British culture is the world’s best is an unanswerable and ultimately pointless question,” he writes, at the beginning of his latest doorstopper. “But it has a very good claim, pound for pound, to be its most successful.” He has the numbers to prove it: £30m in the bank account of Oxford University after it invested in the software that powered Grand Theft Auto; 400m Harry Potter books, 1bn Beatles albums and 2bn Agatha Christie novels sold. The triumph of Downton Abbey in China, Top Gear in Iran and Doctor Who everywhere. (The Doctor, pleasingly, is never far from Sandbrook’s thoughts.) These are the figures that make us, Sandbrook argues, “a cultural superpower”. 
 That phrase is a young one. The magazine editor Tyler Br&ucirc;l&eacute; used it in recognition of the Benzedrine injected into the national bloodstream by the 2012 Olympics. As foreign secretary, William Hague gave it official approval in 2013, as he celebrated the “soft power” channelled by the British Council. Everybody, though, seems to have been beaten to it by the theorist Slavoj Žižek, who, in 2004, used the expression to characterise the narcissistic delusions of his fellow Slovenes. If you say you’re a cultural superpower, he suggested, you’re probably nothing of the sort. “Britain, Britain, Britain!” as Tom Baker once boomed on behalf of Matt Lucas and David Walliams. “We have exported so many great things around the world. Slavery, hooliganism and Starlight Express.” 
 Like the Chinese shotgun with which Tom Baker hunts down a giant rat in Sandbrook’s favourite episode of Doctor Who, the argument of The Great British Dream Factory is made in Birmingham. In the 19th century, the city’s industrialists cast British wealth in furnaces and foundries. In the 20th, Sandbrook argues, their successors shaped other kinds of riches in the fire. In 1954, Tolkien gazed on the Black Country smokestacks and imagined magical rings in the flames of Mordor. In 1965, Tony Iommi bacon-sliced his fingertips in a steel press, left the factory and formed Black Sabbath with Ozzy Osbourne. Ten miles north, Rob Halford, breathing an atmosphere that fizzed with burning grit from the Walsall metalworks, founded Judas Priest and cut the album British Steel. Once, the argument goes, we were the workshop of the world; now we are its Games Workshop, its Radiophonic Workshop. Instead of King Coal, we have Cheryl Cole. 
 If your heart sinks at the thought, then this book has already seen its secrets, and is smiling quietly at your pain. Sandbrook is not one of those writers who revel in the bits of popular culture that, historically, have appealed to intellectuals – think Ernest Dowson at the music hall, Ken Tynan interviewing Morecambe and Wise, Truffaut kneeling before Hitchcock. He is for the Midlands, for Middle Earth, Middle England and the middlebrow. His book is a passionate and admirable defence of coach-party musical theatre, large-print historical fiction, wedding reception rock, Orc sagas, To the Manor Born, Arnold Bennett, Billy Bunter and Billy Elliot. He reads Tom Brown’s Schooldays damp-eyed, elevates Elton John over David Bowie, always gives Margaret Thatcher the benefit of the doubt, and delights in telling us how his colleagues responded when he argued for adding the composer of Evita and Aspects of Love to a list of significant postwar Britons. “Two of my fellow panellists looked at me as if I had just nominated Fred and Rose West,” he says. This book is a 688-page snob trap, with Andrew Lloyd Webber as its tar baby. 
 The villains of the story are the intellectuals, who are always “sneering” or “self-styled”. Sandbrook moons at them from the back of his tour bus, reserving his greatest disrespect for RD Laing, who is the object of “well-deserved contempt”; Virginia Woolf, who is “an upper-class grotesque” and an “upper-class snob”; and Yoko Ono, whose crime is to have retained her copyright over a song that asks us to imagine no possessions.John Lennon’s “Imagine” is the key text of one of Sandbrook’s chapters, but it goes unquoted, as the author baulks at “the prospect of paying for another fur coat for Yoko Ono.” Although he insists that her work is “mercifully beyond the scope of this book” – he can’t resist telling us that her poetry is “artistically worthless”. 
 When Sandbrook is in sympathetic mode, his arguments are strongest. He mounts an enthusiastic defence of Samuel Smiles, the author of Self-Help and presumed intellectual lodestar of Margaret Thatcher. (Lazily presumed, it turns out.) He gives a witty account of the Rolling Stones, not as the raucous bluesmen of the English counterculture, but as a group of men – some shaped by comfortless, threadbare childhoods – who earned a bit of money, made some sound investments in the property market, and became respectable country squires. (There’s a bit of sleight-of-hand here, which involves emphasising the oak panels and military history books in Keith Richards’s Sussex home, and omitting references to the strobe lighting and Dennis Wheatley paperbacks, but the point stands.) 
 The hot core of his story, though, is made of the most thrillingly unlikely material. The novels of Catherine Cookson – ignored by critics and historians, but once devoured by readers, who, in the author’s lifetime, bought 123m copies of her books and borrowed more from the library. As a child, Cookson went barefoot, scavenged from rubbish tips and learned of her illegitimacy at the age of six from a nasty neighbour who wanted to punish her for playing Knock Down Ginger. As a young woman, she suffered four miscarriages, a nervous breakdown and a course of ECT. In later years, as a novelist in the same tax-band as George Harrison, she made visiting relations sit down and listen to a tape-recording of an emotional speech about her early sufferings. If they refused to weep with her, they didn’t get invited back. 
 Cookson’s heroines are raped, beaten, accidentally marry their half-brothers, endure the horrors of prostitution and the workhouse, and tend to accept their fates – which, Sandbrook suggests, is the reason for Cookson’s missing-person status in literary studies. She is not a progressive or a sentimentalist. She depicts working-class life as a pitiless endurance test. This is less the view from Coronation Street, more one from under the boot described by O’Brien in Nineteen Eighty-Four. Sales figures suggest that Cookson’s reputation is fading along with living memory of the environment she portrayed – but perhaps it may one day be rediscovered, as a portrait of a world as grindingly cruel as anything experienced by Winston Smith. 
 How do you perform a stocktake of a nation’s cultural power? Orwell’s sales figures wouldn’t merit a tick on Sandbrook’s clipboard, and many of the most influential forms of British culture would barely trouble the accountants. The makers of the original Poldark didn’t intend their work to be a nation-unifying pleasure in Spain following the death of Generalissimo Franco, but it did the trick. John Sullivan didn’t write Only Fools and Horses to ease Serbia’s transition to capitalism – but the series remains a political touchstone to this day. Who could have predicted that the fall of Romanian communism would be hastened by state television’s decision to replace The Onedin Line – the BBC saga of mutton-chopped mercantilists in 1860s Liverpool – with a dreary alternative imported from North Korea? And yet it happened. Viewers retuned to broadcasts from over the border in Bulgaria, and saw which way the wind was blowing. Once the Romanians had put Nicolae Ceaușescu up against the wall, they invited Peter Gilmore to do a victory lap of the country in the dictator’s old limousine. 
 The prime minister’s office is currently running a £113m campaign called GREAT, the source of an immense series of adverts that aim to convey just how great Britain is. “Entrepreneurs are GREAT!” shouts one, above a picture of Richard Branson looking optimistically into a headwind. “Creativity is GREAT!” bellows another, above the stern features of Judge Dredd, the granite-jawed totalitarian lawman of 2000AD – whose presence may be a subtle acknowledgement that many of the richest products of British culture are founded on dissatisfaction, unease, self-doubt and self-irony. 
 Last month, the ExCel centre in east London was host to the Defence and Security Equipment International exhibition – the Crufts of cluster-bombing, where delegates inspected the very best land-mine and electric-shock baton technology. The sector is worth £59bn to the British economy – £20bn less than the estimate for our cultural industries. On the morning it opened, commuters on the Jubilee Line found that the ads above their seats had been razored out and replaced with cheerful alternatives dreamed up by Banksy, probably the world’s best-known living British artist – and a figure whose value, pound for pound, is impossible to assess. 
 “Selling arms is GREAT!” – shouted one, above a picture of Prince Charles in traditional Saudi dress, larking about with a sword. “Bombing is GREAT!” enthused another, above an image of a girl sitting in a pile of rubble in Gaza. If they prove to be the most memorable cultural legacy of the campaign, the irony will be priceless.
