Helen Simpson has been publishing short stories, and only short stories, for her entire writing career, little miracles that cut straight to the heart of the matter – be that love, lust, babies, death, apocalypses global or individual – without ever losing their mystery. She introduced her 2012 selected works, A Bunch of Fives, with a wonderfully barbed Q&A in which an imaginary interviewer takes her to task for her “domestic” subjects, her slim output and her lack of a novel. “Five years per collection, though! – Why so slow?” “Surely you find [the short story form] limiting?” “Are you a man-hating feminist?” 
 “Funny how these stories start with sex then move on to babies and finish up with cancer…” muses her passive-aggressive interlocutor. “Well, what do you expect over 25 years?” Simpson replies. Her books have tracked the stations of life, with groundbreaking collections such as Dear George and Hey Yeah Right Get a Life illuminating the shock, intensity and boredom of early motherhood, as well as the way parenthood inevitably “gender-politicises relationships”. Her sixth book, Cockfosters, moves on a stage: now the women are standing uncertainly on the brink of menopause, buying varifocals, remarking how very glad they are not to be “doing that any more” when they see younger women struggling with small children; while the men are having heart scares or moving, with a combination of exhaustion and entitlement, on to their second wife and set of children. 
 Time is Simpson’s great subject – many characters here are preoccupied with how long they have left – but she calls these stories after places, from “Cheapside”, in which a City lawyer’s efforts to interest a teenager in the profession delicately contrast legal concepts of duty and negligence with the breakdown of his first marriage, to “Arizona”, where the fierce light of the American state symbolises a brave new world on the other side of menopause. The title story is the kind of piece Simpson does so well, structuring a journey to the end of the Piccadilly line to retrieve a lost pair of glasses around the stations on the way, as two old friends discuss their past, present and possible future. Like the Venerable Bede’s sparrow flying through a banqueting hall, a metaphor for the brevity of life and the unknowable void before and after, they zip through each lit-up station and back into the darkness. Until they reach Cockfosters, the end of the line – “But not for us,” jokes Philippa. Not this time. 
 Simpson’s earlier characters often struggled to fit a conversation or a book around the demands of children. Cockfosters is full of discussion, most notably the dreamy, associative chat of “Arizona”, in which an acupuncturist and her client muse on the ageing process and the heightened inner life shaped by the menstrual cycle (“Not untrue; not to be acted on, either”). The brisk catch-up and polemical declarations in “Kentish Town” are less successful, as a book group of women named for Dickens heroines compare his Christmas book The Chimes with a contemporary world sinking further into inequality. 
 The joker in the pack is “Erewhon”, a gender-reversal fantasia narrated by Colin, who lies awake fretting over the inescapable fact that the world is “woman-shaped” and his career, opinions and desires will always come second to his wife Ella’s. “The media is so disparaging of men over 40, he thought; the way it zooms in on our paunches and spindle shanks, our pendulous earlobes.” Unfortunately, the story comes off as twee rather than challenging, in part because the rhetorical attitudes it satirises – “Those pants are getting tired”, comments Ella in the bedroom; and, “Childcare? That’s your job”, while Colin comforts himself with Cadbury’s Fruit & Nut – have already atrophied into sitcom stereotypes. 
 Infinitely more thought-provoking and open-ended is “Moscow”, in which a high-achieving businesswoman strips away the layers of her past. It’s a story given power by its emotional hinterland, the decades of life beyond the page. The same is true of the longest piece, “Berlin”. Here we meet a fiftysomething couple on a “ Ring package” to Germany, where they must endure four long evenings of Wagner. “Bellowing, bullying. Balls-achingly boring. Just like Dad,” declares Adam, whose distant father spent Adam’s childhood sulking behind locked doors, blaring out the Ring cycle. 
 As in her earlier story, “Opera”, in which a terrible evening of corporate hospitality cannot ruin a performance of Orpheus and Eurydice, Simpson exposes the mannerisms of artwork and audience alike, while simultaneously taking us deep within the experience of the music, where we watch Tracey’s inner thoughts rise to the “emotion in the air”. The other couples on the package tour are older than Adam and Tracey: they represent what is to come, if both can commit to staying together – a twilight of humans, rather than gods. Opera, says one, is where you can do your “violent living”, and there is of course a vast ironic distance between Wagner’s bombast and the middle-class pensioners snoozing through it. As with all her stories about art, that distance is both drily and tenderly measured, and entirely human. It’s this tightrope balance between our outer lives and inner expanses that continues to make her writing sing.
