In the current biggest sellers of mystery fiction – Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train – absent women are a constant presence. So one distinction of another recent mega hit in the genre – SJ Watson’s Before I Go to Sleep – was that the girl was still around, with only her memory gone. 
 More conventionally, Watson’s successor to his super-selling debut turns on a girl who is gone. A young woman called Kate Plummer has been murdered in Paris in what French cops consider a mugging gone wrong, but, at the start of a 432-page novel, clearly won’t have been. And soon, the victim’s older sister and the novel’s narrator, Julia Plummer, is told by Kate’s flatmate, Anna, that the dead woman was in the habit of having sex – first virtual, then physical – with men she met online. 
 The narrative is well-travelled – the opening chapters dashing, in actuality and flashback, between London, Paris and Berlin – although Watson’s characters risk being turned away from planes and trains because they are so weighed down with baggage. Julia, a professional photographer, is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, whose 14-year-old son, Connor, is actually the child of Kate, given up for adoption when she became pregnant from a fling with an unknown man. Though lacking a father, the adolescent has been lucky with his stepfather, Julia’s cardiac surgeon husband, Hugh Wilding, and has just made a girlfriend online. Julia sometimes tries to check on his virtual activities when she is not herself surfing dating sites, certain that she will find her sister’s killer there. 
 In Before I Go to Sleep, the dilemma for Christine was whether she could trust anything said to her, and Watson has found a satisfying parallel situation in the notorious unreliability of online identities. Julia can never be sure who she is really speaking to and neither can the reader: a name on the page may have another one behind it. 
 While resemblances to Watson’s previous book and to those of generic rivals seem justified, the narrative strand featuring Julia’s internet dating feels, less happily, like an attempt to tie up the fan base of Fifty Shades of Grey as well. The fantasies Julia pursues in the hope of luring the murderer include “being taken by force, not quite against my will, but almost. Being tied to the bed, handcuffs, rope.” Whatever you think of EL James, she was a woman exploring extreme female sexual fantasy, whereas Watson, more problematically, is a man doing so. 
 But death is always more central to the narrative than sex. Because suspense novels depend on misleading or fooling the audience, readers’ estimation of a book in the genre will depend on how successfully they are duped and, with me, the record was mixed. Two of the three major twists in Second Life would surely be seen coming by the emeritus professor of gullibility at the State University of Hoodwinking, while the third might elude even the dean of scepticism at the College of Unfoolability. In the same way, Hitchcock might have admired the manner in which Watson contrives to have his characters out of mobile-phone contact in a major city at a crucial moment, although the director would have been sniffy about the way Julia gets into an apartment block. 
 These days, there is also an extra level of tension for the reader of suspense novels. It was once an absolute rule of the genre that a first-person narrator must remain alive at the end of the story, in order to have told it. Recently, though, some such narratives have used cheats, including sudden revelations of ghosts or ghost-writers, to allow the “I” to die. And, while Watson avoids either supernatural or metafictional explanations, his closing paragraphs risk inducing irritation. 
 Watson’s debut novel was published in a cacophony of foreign languages, and Second Life is heavy with language-primer lines – “I’ve made a chicken pie and it turned out well” – that seem calculated to allow translators to work briskly. The dialogue is rarely idiomatic and the linking prose simply descriptive, which is a pity because occasional linguistic flourishes suggest Watson can rise to a more interesting style. The best sentences cleverly subvert the meanings of the words “composed” and “virtually” and the subtle variations of name in a person’s life are well done: Kate is Katie online and Auntie Katie to her son until, after her death, he begins to refer to Kate as “Mum”, paining his adoptive mother. 
 After the huge success of Before I Go to Sleep, Watson’s second book was always going to be a problem and Second Life indeed proves so, although always gripping and skilful enough to suggest that lightning may strike again in book three.
