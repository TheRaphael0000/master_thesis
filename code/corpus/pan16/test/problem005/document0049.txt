When Some Luck, the first volume in Jane Smiley’s monumental Last Hundred Years trilogy, opened in 1923 on the Iowan farmstead where Walter Langdon lived with his wife and young son Frank, the accents of their immigrant ancestors were still audible. On the horizon only the lights of Des Moines and Chicago could be seen; the great metropolises of San Francisco, Washington and New York were no more than a distant glow. If Some Luck scouted the territory and laid the groundwork, Early Warning, which covers the second half of the 20th century, looks set to do the heavy lifting. 
 The first volume ended with Walter’s death in 1953; Early Warning opens with his funeral. The message already is clear. This is not a narrative of great shifts and leaps; it does not use births, marriages and deaths as a springboard, but to consolidate and regroup (like Francis Ford Coppola in another great American trilogy, The Godfather ). This narrative is about continuity: at Walter’s funeral, like a good matriarch (or the “switching station” Frank’s sister Lillian feels herself to be, handing the baton from one family member to another), Smiley gathers the Langdons in and counts heads. 
 Frank, the lean blue-eyed loner and second world war sniper turned coolly ruthless businessman and occasional CIA operative, is the oldest of Walter and Rosanna’s five surviving children, with a daughter and newborn twins of his own. There are eight Langdon grandchildren at the novel’s outset; by its close, Rosanna and Walter’s descendants will number 19, and counting. Refracted through the multiple narrative viewpoints of Frank, his siblings and a further handful of descendants, the decades documented in Early Warning herald vast change for the US. They contain the murders of presidents, seismic movement in the prices of oil and real estate, the struggle for civil rights, the summer of love and the taking of hostages in Iran, but we apprehend them only as one Langdon or another has occasion to walk near to the action. Still living on the land where he was born, Joe watches the rise and fall of wheat, oil and real estate prices, while in Chicago Henry tiptoes out of the closet and encounters the Aids crisis. In Washington Lillian’s charming clown (and spook) of a husband, Arthur, is heading for a dangerous breakdown in the fallout from catastrophic foreign policy; and in San Francisco Frank’s estranged daughter, Janet, sits at the back of the Reverend Jim Jones’s congregation wondering whether to follow him to Guyana. The assassinations of Martin Luther King and John F Kennedy are barely mentioned, because no Langdon was there, but in a brilliantly orchestrated aside, Frank walks out of the lobby of Los Angeles’s Ambassador hotel as Bobby Kennedy’s murderer is walking into its kitchen. Only Lillian and Arthur’s troubled son, Tim, walks slap bang into history, in Vietnam, and the effect is phenomenally powerful. 
 Her cast is big, and growing all the time, but Smiley has a remarkable grip on all her characters, from the major players such as the prickly, proud Janet to Claire’s grasping control-freak of a husband, Paul, and Lillian’s shy, tender-hearted son, Dean, who barely utters a word until he breaks down at her funeral. So unhurried, so comprehensive and so intimate is the access Smiley allows, that we know almost before we are told that Henry is meticulous and orderly, not because he is gay, but because he is like his grandmother, and that Joe’s son, Jesse, can shoot because Frank is his uncle. Frank himself, the mesmerising centre of the first novel, is turning grey, his aura fading, but his legacy is already springing up elsewhere: in Lillian’s opaque, solitary son, Tim; in Joe’s Jesse, whom Frank loves more than his own children; and in the riveting psychodrama he has fostered between his twins, the brutish Michael and edgy, dangerous Richie. We even remember, when Arthur commits a dreadful act lying beneath the marital bed, that the infant Frank would hide from his parents under theirs: we at once observe how families operate as organisms and feel ourselves embedded in a living, breathing one. 
 Comparisons have already been made with John Updike’s towering Rabbit tetralogy, and both writers have an extraordinary ability to define what it is to be American at the most intimate level. But where Updike is the consummate stylist, Smiley speaks more plainly; where he is cool, she is warm. She is also very funny (when Arthur says that Frank wears his heart on his sleeve and Lillian says she has never noticed it, he responds drily, “It’s a very small heart”) and too finely intelligent to stoop to folksiness. 
 In fact, what Smiley feels most like here, for her faultless skill in bringing a wide cast so vividly into being that we would know them anywhere, for the remarkable intensity of her feeling for territory and landscape and her combination of impatient intellect, emotional perspicacity and unfailing humanity, is America’s Tolstoy. The satisfactions of the first two volumes of this trilogy have been so complex and nourishing that the comparison seems justified, and the third instalment can’t come soon enough.
