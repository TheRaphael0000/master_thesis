Valerie Martin’s work is distinguished by an alluring precision – her details, both exact and provocative, position the reader just where she or he needs to be in order to understand what Martin is getting at. In this new volume of 12 stories written between 1982 and 2014, it is evident that while Martin may have honed her technique over the years, her consistent goal has been to go deeper and see more clearly. She has succeeded – all of the stories are striking; all of them bear a resemblance to one another, like large families, where the cousins don’t necessarily get along, despite looking alike. 
 Many of the pieces are set in New Orleans and the Louisiana bayous, where Martin grew up, in a world full of artists and animals. In “His Blue Period”, the narrator is recalling a now famous painter he knew when they were young in the 70s in New York City. The painter mistreated his girlfriend, who, for consolation, visited the narrator’s studio and fed carrots to his rabbits. In the longest story, “The Unfinished Novel”, which runs to 60 pages, the narrator is the successful one; he remarks: “If offered the opportunity to call back to life Rita or Joey, I knew I would choose, without hesitation, the cat.” But it is old girlfriend Rita, a failed novelist, now obese and contemptuous, who shows up. In “Et in Acadiana Ego”, from 2011, I see that Martin and I must have shared a childhood fantasy, because the beloved who transforms the life of Mathilde, a 17-year-old orphan and heiress, is a centaur. Both artists and animals are imperfect and beset with conflicts. Neither is guaranteed to live happily ever after. 
 In all of her works, including Property (for which she won the Orange prize in 2003), The Confessions of Edward Day and The Ghost of the Mary Celeste, Martin has played at the boundary between realism and surrealism, between wit and cruelty. Her characters understand sympathy, empathy and kindness, and they are at their most truthful when they must decide, right in front of the reader, which path to take. For Martin, there is no morality without cost, and that is, perhaps, her most realistic quality. 
 But even though she has never hesitated to experiment and to address important social, personal and political issues, what I like most about Martin’s work are the worlds she plops me into that coexist with worlds I somehow missed (we are about the same age) – her 1970s New York artists struggle to get by on tips in a much rougher city than the one we know today. The death of a couple that is witnessed by a mermaid (“Sea Lovers”) takes place at a beach I find vaguely familiar, but that is much more mysterious than my local beach. In “The Open Door”, the apartment in Rome where an American poet and her partner, a Costa Rican dancer somewhat past her prime, are arguing is much more appealing than any apartment in Rome that I ever visited. “The Incident at Villedeau” makes me want to creep through Louisiana bayou country, to take in the scent of the air and spy on the mysterious inhabitants. Has Martin ever been boring? Ever not seen more than the rest of us have managed? 
 If I have a beef with these stories, it is that any one of them might have been a novel and didn’t get to be. I think this is particularly true of “The Incident at Villedeau” and “The Unfinished Novel”. In both stories, character and setting are luxuriantly developed and fascinating, but the conflict, and therefore the plot, gets a little short-changed. “The Incident at Villedeau” is a variant on a murder mystery – the murderer is known but the details and motive remain mysterious all the way to the end and past it – but the form demands a little more parsing. In “The Unfinished Novel”, Rita’s newly revived relationship with the narrator doesn’t steep for long enough for me to feel satisfied with the denouement, or with the narrator’s solution to the inner conflicts that Rita arouses in him. 
 There aren’t many prolific authors that we want more of, but Martin is one of them. Like all authors, she has her characteristic themes and methods, but since her main interest seems to be systematic investigation of the strange and the out-of-the-way, she always produces something unexpected and revelatory.
