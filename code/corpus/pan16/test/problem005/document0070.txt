On Father’s Day 2005, an Australian window cleaner named Robert Farquharson was driving his young sons back to his estranged wife after an access visit. Halfway home, on a lonely stretch of Geelong road, he swerved across a dam into a deep, manmade pond. He swam free; all three of his children drowned. Farquharson told the police he’d suffered a coughing fit and passed out at the wheel. His wife supported him. The trials and appeal that followed took seven years and gripped Australia. They also drew the attention of one of Australia’s greatest living writers, Helen Garner, who after visiting the “little white crosses, three of them, knee-deep in grass” embarked on her third book-length account of a court case. 
 This House of Grief is in many ways similar to The First Stone, Garner’s controversial take on a university sexual harassment case, and Joe Cinque’s Consolation, the more straightforward – though still furious – story of the murder of a working-class Italian-Australian by his student girlfriend. As in these books, Garner takes us into the Victoria Courthouse and lights its daily rituals with her limpid prose: “in the high, white space of Court Eleven, everything gently shone. Counsel’s chairs and microphones waited in rows down the long table. Cool air streamed in from some mysterious source.” Again, she shows us Melbourne’s lawyers, florid in their roles: emotional defence barrister Morrissey, “big, fair, and bluff, Irish-style, with the bulk and presence of a footballer”; “lean, contained-looking” prosecutor Rapke. 
 Again, Garner shows us her facility for recording speech and, even more remarkably, the “waves of emotion and private mental activity” of group listening, now honed to almost hallucinogenic clarity. She conveys the pained excitement of the courtroom as Farquharson is condemned by the evidence of a friend who tricked him into confidences while wearing “a wire down the front of his pants”; then changes pace to give us the thrilling cut and thrust as Morrissey takes the betrayer to pieces. Equally vividly, Garner portrays how “the air in the court became a jelly of confusion and boredom” as all who were listening were bogged down for days in the details of the way Farquharson’s car – the car about which he was engaged in a bitter and crucial ownership dispute with his wife – skidded off the road into the water: “The judge took off his spectacles and violently rubbed his eyes. Journalists sucked lollies to stay awake. Jurors’ mouths went square with the effort to control their gaping yawns.” 
 Here, too, are Garner’s characteristic sympathies: with working people, immigrants, mothers. She is drawn to the drowned boys’ grandparents, Bev and Bob Gambino, as she was to Joe Cinque’s parents. She depicts their daughter, Cindy, as a sensual, heavy lidded, modern Madonna. She detects in the rough young men on the stand – Cindy Gambino’s new partner, the carpenter who pulled Farquharson out of the dam – “that little buzz of glamour peculiar to the Australian tradie”. On the other hand, she turns on Rapke’s young, female deputy the acidic eye with which she etched Cinque’s murderer – the eye for strutting and stilettos and entitlement. 
 And here, in every scene, is Garner herself, thirsty for coffee, wisecracking, observant: her very own USP. For she takes the opposite path to Truman Capote when it comes to accounts of crime. Rather than abstract herself from the scene, as Capote did writing In Cold Blood, she includes or even obtrudes herself, brandishing her armfuls of personal baggage. In The First Stone, this method seemed to have arrived by accident: Garner wrote impetuously and publicly to the accused before the trial or the book began; after that, she was cast as her own gadfly. In Joe Cinque’s Consolation, though, when the story is more violent and her involvement more distant, the discussion of personal sympathy became a delicate political tool. It was as if by admitting the chips that bristled on her own shoulder – working class, white, Lutheran, feminist, child of the sexual revolution – Garner was inviting us to discount them from her story, to get to our own truth. In this third book the approach has changed again. Now, rather than play the alienated gadfly, or get an exclusive angle, she sits and chats to the other writers, weaving herself into the court, the community of witnesses. When Farquharson is convicted, she is knitting, and marks the moment with “one red stitch. Then I knitted to the end of the row, and cast off.” 
 This is a communal, painful effort: the lawyers and jury are engaged in the difficult understanding that a man murdered his children, and so is Garner. Together, they watch the police reconstructions of the sinking car, witness the anguish of Farquharson’s wretched, betraying friend. Everyone is resistant to the obvious conclusion: as a lawyer walking past the court says, “I’ve got two reactions to this. He can’t possibly have done it. But there’s no other explanation.” Garner makes herself her own experimental subject: she identifies and dismantles her defences against taking in this thought – that she hopes, for example that if Farquharson is found not guilty, the boys will be restored to life – and observes two juries doing the same. Then she takes down her defences against believing that this man was essentially different from her. Painstakingly, she shows us his sisters, his gestures, his handkerchief: he was ordinary, his life was ordinary, yet he really did plan to kill his children because of an argument over a car. 
 This careful record of the mind and its workings, of the strange dance we take toward truth, makes the narrative compelling and the story fresh through all the trials and retrials. It also insists that Farquharson and his children belong to all of us. As Garner says as she returns in her mind to the boys’ graves, after their father’s last appeal is rejected: “Every stranger grieves for them. Every stranger’s heart is broken. The children’s fate is our legitimate concern. They are ours to mourn.” It’s an elegiac farewell, and indeed the whole book feels final, elegiac – perhaps because for all the horror, it is so elegantly and calmly written; perhaps because This House of Grief completes so many arcs begun in Garner’s previous works; perhaps because it is impossible to imagine it being done better.
