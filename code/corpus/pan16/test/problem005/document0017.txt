Rebecca Makkai writes about truly odd women – not hackneyed good-girls-gone-bad, but women who turn out to be surprisingly hard-assed, or unexpectedly breakdown-adjacent, or a little bit mean. They do not classify easily as either likable or unlikable. They operate outside that too-simple, and much debated dichotomy. Sometimes they operate outside of morality too. 
 Forsaking the young writer’s traditional story-to-novel trajectory, Makkai – whose debut short-story collection, Music for Wartime, appears this week – has already published two novels, both of which featured these attractive amoralists. The Borrower, her debut, was a snappy book about a librarian-turned-kidnapper that I will refrain from calling a “romp” only because I have read that Makkai abjures the practice. The Hundred-Year House is a more challenging, more satisfying novel about the strange history of a midwestern artists’ colony. But it is with this collection of short stories that Makkai really claims her own authorial voice. 
 As it happens, the short story is the ideal venue for Makkai’s considerable talent, not only for drawing nuanced characterisations, but for contriving strange and fascinating premises. In Painted Ocean, Painted Ship, a promising young professor of English mistakenly shoots an albatross and then makes some very poor decisions in her dealings with a student. In Cross, a group of chamber musicians convene in the home of one of their members, the lawn of which has been colonised by a tacky memorial to a deceased teenaged stranger. In the final story of the collection, The Museum of the Dearly Departed, a woman finds out the truth about her fiance when he, his mistress, and the other residents of a small apartment building are killed in the night by a carbon monoxide leak. The November Story, destined for anthologisation, is narrated by a production staff member of a reality show that pits desperate artists against one another, Survivor-like, in competition for a large grant: “We say, ‘Remember that this is a job, that we’re paying you, and your job is to answer all the questions. Then we ask, ‘What do you hate about Lesley?’ ‘I don’t hate her,’ they say.” 
 This is great, absorbing stuff. And it is all delivered with just the right measure of economy (I couldn’t help but compare Good Saint Anthony Come Around, a perturbing romance from the gay art scene of New York in the 1980s, to Hanya Yanagihara’s recent novel A Little Life, which covers some of the same ground but is 800 pages long). 
 Makkai wanders even into the proverbial – a dead elephant buried in an empty municipal pool – and the surreal: in Couple of Lovers on a Red Background, a woman finds a pint-sized Johann Sebastian Bach inside her piano, and sets up house with him once he achieves adult stature: 
 The Kafkaesque story The Briefcase, populated by men known only as “the chef” and “the professor” in some nameless, probably eastern European place, has been heavily anthologised and appears here again, anchoring the vignettes from the titular wartime that are sprinkled throughout the collection. These stories, such as The Singing Women, or Acolyte or Everything We Know About the Bomber, have a runic quality that, while allowing for some haunting images – a drunken soldier chugging a bottle of ink – sometimes also permit Makkai to indulge her worst habit as a writer, which is concluding a chapter or story on a note that is more pat than profound. For example: according to family legend, the ink-poisoned soldier falls dead; rather than letting us take it all in, Makkai concludes, “But if this were your family legacy – this ridiculous assertion of the might and violence of ink, this blatant and beautiful falsehood – could you change it? Would you dare?” 
 Her endings are more powerful when they are allowed to breathe; at the conclusion of Good Saint Anthony, a seriously ill painter falls and gets hopelessly stuck under the running shower; he allows the rising water to liberate him: “It was grace itself. He floated over the edge, dropped into the puddle below, and – blessed, exhausted, fingers pruned – rolled to safety.” 
 But these are just little things. Behind every writer is a voracious reader, and the challenge of writing well is to let go of the things that you read even while you owe them your very sense of the ideal way to arrange words on the page. Makkai’s first book was a book about readers, but it was also a self-professed love letter to Nabokov that was slightly too self-conscious to carry off the comparison. Makkai’s more recent work has to do with artists – writers and painters and sculptors and musicians – and she makes these collide in interesting and unusual ways with historicity and domestic dramas. It’s a serious and scary thing to situate yourself in a tradition. But with Music for Wartime, Makkai takes her place – one she deserves – among the artists with aplomb.
