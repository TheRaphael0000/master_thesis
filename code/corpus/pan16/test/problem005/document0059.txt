“Did I ever wonder who my mother used to be, before she belonged to me?” Tracy K Smith asks early in her new memoir, Ordinary Light. “I have the recollection of her struggling once or twice to describe her younger self to me, and finding that girl unrecognizable. The phrase she used, that so much seemed to hang upon, was ‘I was searching’. What were you searching for? I would ask, confused, eager to understand.” 
 In the book, Smith is trying, as she can, to answer her late mother’s spiritual quest with her own. Her remarkable poetry – she has published three volumes thus far, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Life on Mars – has featured her mother and father before, if in flashes. But Ordinary Light offers a longer, fuller illumination of their histories, as Smith tries to understand her own 1970s-era middle-class Californian upbringing in relationship to the brutality of black life in America during the 1950s. 
 Smith is the youngest of five children, born well after the others. She is the one coming up from behind, the last to leave home, and the one who wonders if she was born to console her mother after the others had left. The memoir opens on her mother’s deathbed scene: she and her siblings do what they can to ease their mother’s pain before she slips away. When Smith says her goodbye alone, she clips a few strands of hair from her mother’s nape, a talisman. “Suddenly, those few strands, things I’d have once thought nothing of brushing off her shoulders or discarding from among the tines of her hairbrush, were consecrated, a host.” 
 In the next chapter, the woman we saw die is vividly alive: an Air Force wife and home maker in Fairfield, California. Smith is now rewound to a girl of three, nicknamed Kitten, wandering a house full of books. The chapters that follow are calibrated roughly to one major event per year of her young life: the Halloween ghost costume that too closely resembled a KKK hood; a trip to Alabama, to visit her mother’s mother, known to the entire extended family as Mother; her struggles with the Book of Revelation; her first poems; her complicated crush on the high school teacher who loved her back; her education at Harvard. 
 Throughout, food is of powerful importance – so much so, I’d nearly call this a food memoir. When she describes her uncles from New York as “men who called everybody by nicknames, kicked off their shoes, and ate sandwiches at midday made from biscuits and peach preserves and thick strips of leftover bacon”, you want to go make that sandwich. On a trip to a family friend’s fruit orchard to pick fruits for preserves, her mother tries to feed her a fig; Smith is lyrical even in childish digust: “It looked like a venomous sea creature, but when she lifted the fruit to her own lips, she practically swooned, like a woman on television who had just lowered herself into a bathtub full of bubbles.” 
 When finally faced with the prospect of losing her mother after her cancer diagnosis, Smith is newly aware that she doesn’t really know her. Here she learns food can tell a story, too: 
 These, Smith says, are what her mother usually offered of her past, “an assortment of disjointed parts”. And she was often afraid to ask for more, “out of fear of what it might force me to accept, namely that along with these quaint or colorful facts of country life came a darker portrait, of struggle or injustice”. 
 “What were you searching for?” turns out to be a circular question. In the book’s epilogue, Smith has brought her own newborn daughter home – and begins asking the question again, this time for herself. The answer? The very gentle, loving structure of Smith’s life, her mother’s deliberate choice for her after marching in Montgomery – after having fought to give her children the right to the powerful benefits of a middle-class American life, she did. This poet’s memoir then also something of a bildungsroman, a spiritual education learned both at her mother’s side and after, a powerful meditation on being a daughter and, by the end, on being a mother, too.
