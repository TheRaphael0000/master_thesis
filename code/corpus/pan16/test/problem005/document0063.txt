As the economic historian Robert Skidelsky acknowledges in his account of the last 115 years in the UK, it has often been argued that something went terribly wrong during that period. Britain may have avoided fascism, communism and widespread civil strife, but it abdicated world leadership in industry, fell back in technological advancement and its culture became parochial. The critique has come from both the Marxist left (in the form of Perry Anderson and Tom Nairn’s thesis of an “incomplete bourgeois revolution”) and the Thatcherite right (Correlli Barnett or Martin Wiener’s attacks on an effete, anti-industrial British elite). Skidelsky’s book recognises much of the truth of these arguments, but maintains that it doesn’t really matter, because most people within the UK are vastly richer, healthier and better educated than they were in 1900. By the end of the book, it sounds like the most depressing of victories. 
 This is an unashamedly mandarin history – “history from above, because history is mainly made from above”, from a perspective where the British people are the “(somewhat rebellious) beneficiaries and victims of the actions and behaviour of the governing class”. This “hammer and anvil” view of history is qualified by the argument that the wars, the depression, the welfare state, and a neoliberal settlement that was both “democratic” in spirit and resulted in a collapse of democratic participation, were supported, at least passively, by either the majority or a large minority of British subjects. Communism, fascism, or even an efficient, egalitarian, hi-tech north-European social democracy didn’t arrive here because most people didn’t particularly want them, and were able to express this rejection electorally. Skidelsky doesn’t flatter British moderation too much, however, and a certain distance from British prejudices and obsessions in the China-born professor’s work is to its benefit. 
 The first part of the book sets the intellectual, economic and cultural scene, and is more interesting than the second half’s slightly pedestrian narrative of political history from 1900 to 2014. The “scene” is mainly suburbia, in a century where “towns expanded outwards, not upwards”. True as this may be, it needs updating, as does his assertion that London fell from its peak “of 8.3 million in 1951 to just over 7 million in 2001” – in 2015 that peak was surpassed. The return of the inner city, at least in the capital, is glancingly noted. He claims, accurately, that “regeneration was most successful when the middle class did it”, if “successful” is measured in monetary terms. The urban landscape of industry was dismantled with a speed and recklessness that have left large parts of urban Britain as wastelands – in “sharp contrast to continental countries like Germany, which maintained their manufacturing base”. 
 Although Skidelsky is broadly approving of multiculturalism (particularly in helping improve the country’s “disgusting” food), and a still extant “kind and tolerant” ethos, he believes that distinctive proletarian and bourgeois cultures have been destroyed. The upper and middle classes have abdicated from serious culture in terror at being seen as “elitist”. He notes that Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams and RH Tawney shared a respect for working-class culture, for “its stress on solidarity, its stubbornness, its earthiness, its passion for education”, and hoped that this could help form the basis of a common democratic ethic. Skidelsky sees this prospect being eroded first by postwar affluence – once working-class life was more enjoyable, why aspire to rise out of it? – and, later, by the intellectually stunting effects of mass culture. 
 This is the weakest part of the analysis. One chapter has as its epigraph Morrissey claiming that “Iggy Pop, Lou Reed and Patti Smith ” were his generation’s “Goethe, Gide and Gertrude Stein ”. This statement doesn’t quite say what Skidelsky thinks it does, given that the cited singers are not necessarily inferior to (at least two of) the authors mentioned. In fact they were very frequently a bridge for working-class youth from music to literature or the avant garde, which complicates his eventual dismissal of pop culture (bar, partly, punk) as mere “entertainment”. Buried in the bibliography is a citation of Salford dock clerk turned rock singer Mark E Smith ’s ghostwritten autobiography, but if Skidelsky wanted to know what had happened to the working-class tradition of self-education in the second half of the century, he’d have been far better off citing the lyric sheet to Smith’s band the Fall’s Hex Enduction Hour, where he would find an aggressively modernist sensibility closer to the caustic grotesqueries of Wyndham Lewis than the warm fireside scenes of Richard Hoggart. 
 British democracy is charted from the granting of equal suffrage in the inter-war years to its current collapse: “In the 19th century democracy arose as a check on oligarchy. Today it may well be giving way to plutocracy”, where politicians offer “different brands of the same consumer good”. By 2014, “the rich openly ruled”. This change is largely down to the huge success of neoliberalism between 1979 and 2008 (which he optimistically believes marks its quietus). Skidelsky takes the view that Thatcherism was cruel, obnoxious and fundamentally necessary, painting the familiar picture of the 1970s as a decade of terminal crisis. 
 It is a shame that the more recent, revisionist work on the era, such as Andy Beckett’s When the Lights Went Out, is not allowed to complicate this blanket dismissal of social democratic prospects. Similarly, comparisons with other countries are kept to a bare minimum, as Skidelsky rejects the idea at the outset that “success” should be measured by example, though his strictures on trade unions would be interesting read alongside the German experience, those on non-means-tested benefits alongside the welfare philosophy of Sweden. 
 In the end, the refusal to compare makes his account of “success” all the more devastating, as Britain’s cultural and political life is read entirely on its own suffocating terms. The book ends with an account, which Skidelsky gamely tries to make sound important, of the astonishingly trivial rivalry between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, and, more significantly, the latter’s role in “saving” world capitalism by insisting on nationalisation at the height of the financial crisis. Perhaps this is the most significant thing a British politician has done since Thatcher; that it was done by a former socialist firebrand is remarkably apt. At the end of this success story, Skidelsky predicts a “lonely, introverted future”.
