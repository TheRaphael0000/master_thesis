Any readers who believe New York apartment dwellers are a surly, antisocial bunch who meet their neighbors only if the building catches fire will be cheered by the possibilities for love, sex and fellowship that flower inside the run-down Brooklyn brownstone that is the setting of Kathleen Alcott’s new novel, Infinite Home. In this lyrical, claustrophobic tale, neighbors not only become friends but assume the care of one another that their families refuse. They’ll even undertake cross-country quests in pursuit of long-lost daughters and long-cherished dreams – then again, anyone who has actually rented a Brooklyn apartment would probably do as much on behalf of a landlord who hasn’t raised the rent in 14 years. 
 The Brooklyn of magazine trend pieces – once modest borough turned marketing buzzword – rarely intrudes in any significant way in Infinite Home: nobody drinks kombucha or eats foraged microgreens at a hip new restaurant. Gentrification nevertheless laps at this island of scruffy, artistic semi-poverty, threatening the characters’ retreat from the modern world and drawing them closer as the tides rise higher. Having come to appreciate each other’s presence through the thin walls and floors, which “gave and received heavy-footed trips to the refrigerator and unsnoozed alarm clocks and the burst-and-whoosh of bath faucets and late-night infomercials in a reliable cycle”, their silent coexistence is forced into words as their landlady’s dementia advances. 
 None of the tenants has a conventional job, and nearly all struggle with some form of mental or physical disability (except the washed-up comedian, whose struggles are mostly the emotional fallout of being a washed-up comedian). There’s Thomas, a once-successful painter whose upper body has been rendered partly immobile by a stroke, which has also killed his interest in either art or the company of former friends, “silly, vapid vessels, containers of undercooked opinion and little feeling”. He’s coaxed back to life by a relationship with Adeleine, the beautiful agoraphobe and incipient hoarder across the hall, who lives surrounded by the relics of other people’s pasts. Edward, the comedian, is surviving on the dividend of a hit Christmas movie, written on a “five-day cocaine binge”, and now spends much of his time in the company of Paulie, a sunny-tempered man with Williams syndrome and the mental capacity of a child, and, later, Paulie’s tightly wound sister Claudia, who leaves her marriage to move in with her brother. 
 All the tenants rely on the goodwill and friendship of Edith, the landlady who lives downstairs and whose own family has slipped away – her husband dead and her two children long departed. Alcott’s narrative technique, composed of vivid fragments that don’t sustain themselves for long, is well suited to the portrait of an unravelling mind and its confusion of past and present. Flashes of Edith’s old life return with sudden force, like the night she and her husband spent listening to the ceiling leak into a series of pots and feeling “like they’d been given, instead of a nuisance, a melody”. Her daughter, who vanished to San Francisco at age 18, lives on only in photographs and a glimpse during a news story about hippies on Haight Street. Unlike lost Jenny, her brother Owen “earned good grades and befriended beady-eyed little boys who turned into greedy, scheming young men”. Owen’s pathology is not just capitalist but sexual; at one point, Edith remembers walking in on him apparently assaulting his sister, although “there weren’t words for it like there are now”. 
 Owen’s childhood villainy is compounded when he reappears to disrupt the brownstone’s harmony, bringing in a construction crew to measure the interior, and taping up eviction notices to the doors, “smoothed and aligned so precisely that they nearly eradicated the tenants’ memories of the doors without them”. Owen’s very efficiency is sinister in this ramshackle, creative world. Later, when he is trying to force the tenants out, he entraps and threatens Adeleine, not with rape but with a related violation, systematically and sadistically destroying her precious collections. 
 If there’s a threat in this novel more menacing than Owen, it’s institutions: the homes set up to take care of the elderly and disabled, advertised in the “glossy spread of brochures” that Owen brings to his mother’s kitchen table. Thomas, by contrast, is determined to protect “the old woman with a bittersweet fever in her brain” from her son, and believes that his neighbors share his sense of “decency”. And they do: Edward rather clunkily agrees that the “old lady” shouldn’t live out her days “playing nonsensical checkers with incontinent zombies”. Claudia’s ex-husband, meanwhile, although less evil than Owen, is still irredeemable for refusing to bring the irrepressible Paulie into their home. But to suggest that the only “decent” option is the unpaid, emotionally taxing labor of parents, sisters and neighbors is to put a painfully sentimental gloss on both disability and the work of care. 
 Urbanites cling to particular fantasies of what will heal their loneliness and malaise – the open road, silence, nature and the accidental families assembled by proximity. Despite the pleasures of Alcott’s lavishly descriptive prose and memorable characters, the novel’s effectiveness ultimately depends on how far a reader is willing to go along with those fantasies (property lawyers may have an even harder time with the outcome). No apartment, or building, is really an island – not even in Brooklyn.
