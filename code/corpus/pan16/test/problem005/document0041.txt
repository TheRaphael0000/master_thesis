Of all David “Bunny” Garnett’s countless appearances in Bloomsbury journals, one of the most revealing turns up in Frances Partridge ’s diary in December 1970. Here, our man, nearly 80, arrives for dinner “in a great state about his current love” and her unwillingness to set up house with him in a remote part of France. “Why won’t she come away from it all and live with me and be my love?” he plaintively inquires. It is left to Frances to point out that Bunny’s squeeze is not only several decades younger than him but has a great many concerns of her own to deal with and that the position of ma&icirc;tresse en titre to a man of 78 in a cottage near Montcuq might not be an ideal career move. 
 This air of faint bewilderment – a kind of eternal brow-furrowing over why people wouldn’t instantly fall in with Garnett’s sexual or professional plans – is a feature of Sarah Knights’s exceedingly well-researched and (mostly) sympathetic biography of the author and publisher. The tocsin of pained incomprehension clangs yet more loudly in the late 1950s, when, married to a woman 26 years his junior and about to depart for Geneva to stay with his latest girlfriend, Bunny wonders why his wife is so unhappy. “She has four lovely children,” he informs his diary, “a house she loves, no money worries, and is quite miserable.” That Garnett himself might have been responsible for most of this misery seems scarcely to have occurred to him, but then he was that sort of chap. 
 In faint mitigation, the Rabelaisian principle of fais ce que voudras appears to have been inculcated at a very early age. The son of a distinguished man of letters, Edward Garnett, and his Tolstoy-translating wife Constance, Bunny enjoyed a wildly unconventional upbringing, in which home schooling, trips to Russia and a menage a trois in which his mother happily accepted the presence of the other woman all played conspicuous parts. This is not to charge the senior Garnetts with defective parenting skills, merely to note that it can’t have been easy to bring up a child who, in his biographer’s words, “believed that he was different from other people and that the rules governing them did not apply to him”. 
 Even the experienced Bloomsbury fancier might want to scoff at the “outsider” status Knights claims for her subject in the world of Leonard and Virginia Woolf and Lytton Strachey. Yet, as she demonstrates in thoroughgoing detail, Garnett’s pre-first-world-war life, lived far away from the coteries of King’s College, Cambridge, and Gordon Square, was much more that of a Rupert Brooke -style “neo-pagan”: all late-night naked swimming, sleeping in barns and contraceptives acquired from a “bicycle tyre and hot water-bottle shop”. On the other hand, once he caught up with Bloomsbury, by way of a relationship with the painter Duncan Grant, the twentysomething student botanist never looked back. Lady Ottoline Morrell invited him to her Bedford Square salon; Strachey was enraptured by his “charming way”. Plainly, a great future beckoned. 
 An alternative subtitle for Bloomsbury’s Outsider might have been “How to Win Friends and Influence People”, for, even in the context of second-generation Bloomsbury, Garnett’s was a charmed life. Women threw themselves at his strapping 6ft form (Partridge, on the road with him in the 1960s, felt that she “must be the only female he has travelled with in separate rooms, and I only hope he doesn’t feel humiliated before the hotelier”.) Well-placed friends queued up to offer him satisfying jobs, no matter how hazy his qualifications – “Journalism I am absolutely unfitted for,” he remarked, shortly before accepting the literary editorship of the New Statesman – and a forever faithful JM Keynes once chipped in for the school fees. 
 None of this is to ignore Garnett’s talent, and the stream of well-received novels published in the 1920s and 1930s. All the same this was Bloomsbury, where personal relationships invariably took centre stage. Married in 1921 to Rachel Marshall, Frances’s sister, he set about prosecuting an emotional life that consisted of repeatedly betraying his wife, while stoutly informing her that these satellite relationships weren’t important, and then deploring her resentful silences (“You might reflect,” he informed her in 1928 “that I’m extremely lonely & continually tormenting myself”.) Among other embarrassments, he was responsible for the novel A Man in the Zoo (1924), enhanced with Ray’s elegant woodcuts, but dedicated to two other women of the moment. 
 Marshall died in 1940, by which time her wayward swain was already passionately embroiled with a girl he had first spotted in her cradle back in 1918. This was Angelica Bell, daughter of Vanessa and (although it was never acknowledged) Duncan Grant. Unlike Marshall, the second Mrs Garnett seems to have given as good as she got, sorrowing over lost artistic dreams when, in the 1950s, Bunny set himself up as a gentleman farmer, and going off with boyfriends whenever the mood took her. In response to a letter from Garnett claiming that “my arms are always open”, she arrived on Bunny’s doorstep with the art historian Richard Shone. 
 Of their four daughters, one may very well have killed herself, while another attempted it, and survived. The latter considered it “rather strange” of Garnett “not to have bothered about our education. I don’t just mean that he sent us to stiflingly inadequate schools, but that he never evinced any interest whatsoever in our lessons.” Meanwhile, the books kept coming – Knights lists at least 30 items, ranging from the mercurial Aspects of Love (1955), later brought to the stage by Andrew Lloyd Webber, to extraordinary late-period imaginative flights such as The Sons of the Falcon (1972), written at the age of 79, which reconstructed the small matter of day-to-day life in the Caucasus in the 1860s. 
 The curious thing about this pageant of narcissism, in which one almond-eyed temptress succeeds another and vast amounts of emotional cake are had and eaten too, is how little I found myself resenting it, and how amiably Garnett appears in the various guises Knights has fashioned for him. There is Bunny the zealous aviator (“Oh joy, oh blessed world!”), Bunny the wartime civil servant in his smart new suit (“as gloriously respectable as a jackdaw in his spring plumage”, one friend thought), Bunny the postwar publisher, Bunny computing the milk yields from his dairy cows with the fervour of “Gladstone saying his prayers”. The general effect is of a big, red, shining, India-rubber ball of the kind that features in AA Milne’s poem “King John’s Christmas”, bouncing this way and that to the delight of everyone brought within its orbit. All the same, as is usually the case with these rich bohemian panoramas, you feel sorry for the children.
