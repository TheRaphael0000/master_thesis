Pearl’s body has somehow fetched up in a swollen river among wet stones and rotting branches. Meanwhile, in Pearl’s dank house beyond the riverbank, her daughter Ada wanders dully from room to room, and her granddaughter Pepper fiddles with a camera that has no film. The ties binding these three lie tangled at the heart of a fine, strange novel about the pains of love between mothers and daughters. 
 Lucy Wood’s debut is genuinely anticipated as few first novels are. Her 2012 short-fiction collection, Diving Belles, was highly praised, and her story “Notes from the House Spirits” was shortlisted for the BBC National Short Story Award in 2013. Here, the acute sensitivity to the natural environment and the power of folk myth that distinguish her work are given room to breathe. 
 What sets this novel apart is its extraordinary treatment of the rural setting. It is both uncanny and pitilessly realist: a grudging landscape in which every act, from lighting a stove to clearing a snow-bound drive, is effortful and wearying. The sun is weak and chill, and when blackberries arrive they “come out in their millions”, somehow more reminiscent of a smallpox rash than Keatsian bounty. Petrol is punitively overpriced. The village shop sells charred bread and fleeces tourists for wood that won’t burn. 
 Such a treatment requires formidable descriptive powers, which Wood possesses in spades. There are images so far beyond the commonplace they are startling in the truest sense: they provide little shocks within the prose. These are “sallow days, like something woollen left on the line too long”; particles of fog are “like tiny stitches in a blanket”. At every turn, Wood discards conventional imagery for something altogether more disquieting – a pond is “bilgy”, the sky “turns mirey”. 
 The house in which much of the story takes place is every bit as assertive as the human characters. As Ada ekes odd meals out of tins and listens to the roaring river, it recalls Charles Arrowby’s house in Iris Murdoch ’s The Sea, The Sea – a dwelling-place with a long memory and a loud echo. 
 The power of Wood’s imagination is nowhere more apparent than in the creation of a ghost more credible than many fictional characters. Pearl is given to muttering “Chrissakes!” and has a damp tissue up her sleeve; she has firm views on how to lay a fire and frets that she was an inadequate mother. Such is the insistent and endearing presence of this spirit that much of the novel’s gentle suspense lies in establishing who is haunting whom. For this reason, the term “magical realism” feels inappropriate: there’s no whimsy here, no charming sleights of hand. Rather, Wood persuades the reader to accept the possibility that we might outlast the grave, with all our memories, flaws and virtues intact. 
 One of Wood’s great strengths is the ability to fully inhabit her characters’ consciousness. She skilfully modifies her prose as she moves from one mind to another, leavening her vividly descriptive passages with snippets of speech or thought, wittily profane and colloquial. When we watch the swelling river through Pepper’s eyes, it’s with a child’s untroubled wonder; elsewhere, Ada’s fretful melancholy makes itself felt in the way she battles with a truculent boiler (“Why won’t the thing just bloody … ”). 
 Pepper is a glorious child in the tradition of Harper Lee ’s Scout and Donna Tartt ’s Harriet: too smart for her own good, watchful, wry and infuriating. “Arseballs”, she says, and butts against her mother’s hip in a gesture of furious love. As with the finest of fiction’s children, much of the novel’s sad wisdom comes from her. Musing on Captain, her spiteful cat, she says, “You get a thing and you think it will sit on your lap, or come and find you, or not kill anything, or stop you feeling lonely. But it doesn’t.” 
 Ada is smudged in comparison rather than finely drawn, an elusive and wistful presence – but it is impossible not to feel her profound sadness as she fears she is heir to all her mother’s failings. It is through Ada that the reader gradually perceives the novel’s central theme: that of the persistence of memory, and the way that through remembrance comes the possibility of redemption. 
 Weathering cannot be accused of zipping along – nor does it need to: its power lies in the gradual accrual of unnerving detail, as irresistible as a Dorset river in spate. Once immersed, you can no more escape its pull than Pearl can climb out of the river’s current. On closing the book, I half expected to find my clothes were chill and damp, and that, behind the curtain, there stood a crotchety ghost, fretting for her daughter and blowing her nose.
