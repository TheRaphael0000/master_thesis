Of the many questions posed by Catherine Chanter’s debut, the simplest is, perhaps, the hardest to answer. What manner of book is this? Murder mystery? Science fiction? Freudian psychodrama? Post-apocalyptic feminist parable? All of the above? If the publishers know, they aren’t telling: the packaging – noirish cover design counterpointed by jaunty quote from 2014 literary bestseller Jessie Burton (“I loved this book!”) – only deepens the uncertainty. No problem, you might think: many fine works of fiction float in the slipstream (to borrow one of the novel’s watery metaphors) between genres. But the difficulty when it comes to categorising the novel points to its wider ambiguities: Chanter has chosen to build her book on slippery terrain, where it’s difficult to find solid footholds. In the final chapter, her narrator, Ruth, goes in search of “a book of British wild flowers, because I think I may not know the right names for some of the things I have seen”. Quite. 
 Here’s what we do know. The time is more or less now; the place, a hill farm – the Well. Across the UK, rates of rainfall are diminishing steadily and inexplicably. Ruth Ardingly and her husband, Mark, quit the capital for the farm when concern over the phenomenon is shading into alarm. Their new life begins well enough: a plentiful harvest distracts them from jittery reports of “milk shortages, reduced services on the underground and half-empty shelves in the supermarket”, and the arrival of Ruth’s wayward daughter, Angie, and their beloved grandson, Lucien, turns their first Christmas into a festival of “stars and glitter”. But eventually, ineluctably, they’re drawn back into the national conversation. For reasons unknown, the Well appears to be the one place in the UK where rain is still falling, a lush oasis at the heart of a country grown parched and exhausted. Inevitably, this seeming miracle draws national attention, and the farm rapidly becomes a place of pilgrimage for press and police, government officials and religious fanatics – the latter in the form of a women-only group calling itself the Sisters of the Rose of Jericho, led by the charismatic Amelia. Attention focuses on Ruth herself: is she a witch, an oracle, or a cynical self-promoter? The mystery of the rain is the first of two that galvanise the novel; the second is the question of what has befallen Lucien – and at whose hand. 
 The story is told retrospectively by Ruth, and it soon becomes clear that she’s the least reliable of narrators. Not only are we obliged to take our bearings from recollections that, we suspect, are warped by grief, but Ruth herself openly admits that she does not know what happened at the Well, or why. Having been swept up by the Sisters’ religious fervour and convinced, at least in part, that she was a vessel for something spiritual, she’s now unsure. Like water, trustworthy information is scanty here, and what little of it there is raises more questions than answers. Angie isn’t Mark’s daughter; whose is she, then? Mark was convicted of a crime, but his conviction was overturned; should it have been? What’s the nature of Ruth’s relationship with Amelia? What’s happened to the rain, and will it come back? 
 It’s Chanter’s steadfast refusal to provide us with straight answers that gives a clue to the novel’s real provenance. While from a distance, the story of a country in which the rain stops falling looks like environmental SF in the mould of Margaret Atwood, or John Christopher’s The Death of Grass, this isn’t science fiction, not really. No explanation of the drought is offered, and the wider consequences are left unexplored; society apparently continues to function more or less as it always did. The fact that rain still falls on the Well, meanwhile, is cast as a mystical phenomenon rather than a rational one. While the furniture of the novel is impeccably, even wittily, modern-day (TV documentaries on the unfolding crisis; officious letters from the Drought Monitoring Watchdog; supermarkets continuing to offer online deliveries) and the language contemporary lit-fic, the content is pure fairytale: an elemental story of witches and princes, full of mythic symbolism (roses, wells) and with a conclusion that can only be read as magical. 
 This is a book, then, that requires you to go with the flow, to suspend your disbelief, ignore the signifiers of modernity and accept the logic – or lack thereof – of the fable; the extent to which the novel works for you will depend on your abilit1y to do so. In the end, I fell short. The lack of rigour felt to me like a betrayal of the science fiction set-up, a case of the author not playing fair. But there is undeniable power – both of ideas and execution – here. Fans of the once-upon-a-time, read on.
