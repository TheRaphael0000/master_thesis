Countless doctoral theses have been written on the complexity of Mass Observation’s successes, failures and contradictions, but at the heart of it is a fairly simple set of events. In the late 1930s, a small group of young British intellectuals, mostly on the political left, decided that it was no longer tolerable for the nation’s working classes to be as unknown to the middle and ruling classes as (so one of them put it) the inhabitants of the Trobriand Islands. So, for a period of about two years, they set out to do something about it. 
 From its outset, Mass Observation (MO) had three presiding spirits and two distinct aims. On one wing, there was the south London contingent, led by Humphrey Jennings – now remembered for the wonderful films he made during the second world war – and his friend Charles Madge, then a poet and journalist, later a professor of sociology. Both Madge and Jennings were influenced by surrealism, and particularly the idea that popular culture was to modern societies what the unconscious was to the individual. There were signs out there on the streets waiting to be read, wonders to be uncovered. So Jennings and Madge recruited hundreds of volunteers to write accounts of their daily experiences, leaving out no detail, however trivial: breaking a shoelace, eating sweets, hearing someone swear, chatting to a vendor … 
 The other founding father of MO is nowadays less well-known, though no less remarkable: Tom Harrisson, a swashbuckling, precocious self-taught ornithologist and anthropologist who had no time either for the “poetic” enterprise of the London wing or for their working methods. You do not learn about birds by interviewing them, he insisted: you watch them, as closely as you can and without trying to guess in advance what the results might be. As for birds, so for the proletariat. Harrisson duly took himself off to the slums of Bolton – usually known as “Worktown” in MO documents – rented a cheap terrace house and summoned dozens of idealistic young men (a few women came later) to go people-watching. It is mainly Harrisson’s enterprise that David Hall portrays in this highly readable, anecdote-rich history. 
 Harrisson was an intensely charismatic, inspiring leader who set an example to his adoring entourage by working for 14 hours a day and longer, seldom bothering to wash, shave or change his increasingly fragrant clothes. Like many charismatic leaders, he was also an emotional bully and a whimsical petty tyrant, who might suddenly take to his bed for days to laze and read newspapers, or change into a dinner jacket to meet some rich friends for genteel cocktail parties. 
 Meanwhile, the acolytes had to endure living conditions even more squalid than those of the working people they were surveying: cramped quarters, a perpetual fug of cigarette smoke, the stench of bad drains, lice and bedbugs, and a diet consisting almost entirely of bread and jam, fish and chips, and weak beer. 
 Predictably, and like the members of more recent cults, Harrisson’s spies tended to love him more keenly the more he mistreated them. Among his more illustrious recruits were William Empson, later one of the 20th century’s greatest literary critics, who set about examining sweet-shop windows; the fine photographer Humphrey Spender, a shy soul who suffered agonies of embarrassment and guilt when taking his covert snaps; the distinguished painters Julian Trevelyan and William Coldstream; and others, including Tom Driberg and Richard Crossman. 
 These well-educated chaps did not work in complete isolation from their neighbours; Harrisson, who knew all about the importance of “native informers”, soon persuaded a number of intelligent working people to act as go-betweens and guides. One of them, a coalman by the name of Bill Naughton, went on to have a successful career as a novelist and playwright. 
 Before long, almost everyone who reads about MO finds themselves bursting to say: what a bloody cheek! Why on earth did this coterie of immature swots feel themselves entitled to snoop on their fellow countrymen? Some of the more introspective agents asked themselves this very question, especially when the local press got wind of the operation and called the project “an unequalled opportunity for the pettifogging, the malicious, the cranky, the interfering and the mildly dotty”. 
 As Spender wrote: “We were called spies, pryers, mass-eavesdroppers, nosey-parkers, peeping toms, lopers, snoopers, envelope-steamers, keyhole artists, sex-maniacs, sissies, society playboys.” And he learned the hard way about his middle-class ignorance: people who threatened to beat you up if you took their picture in the pub were not just asserting their dignity – they might be with a woman the wife didn’t know about, or on the dole and in risk of losing their payments. 
 Despite the hostile press campaign, the people of Bolton mostly caught on that these odd young lads with incomprehensibly strangulated speech were guilty of little worse than naivety. The posh boys might be daft, but they were obviously brimming with good intentions, and some of the locals began to enjoy this unfamiliar attention, and to relish having their experiences put on record. In their turn, some of the observers were overwhelmed with admiration at the way in which their new friends coped with their plight: “We saw a child seriously ill with pneumonia in a bed in the kitchen, through the wainscoting of which rats made a nightly invasion … The lives of these people are robbed of decency, dignity and privacy even in the sacred intimacies of birth and death, yet their heroism is marvellous.” 
 A more cheerful discovery was that those with a few spare shillings after Friday payday definitely knew how to have fun. One of the main laboratories of MO was the local pub, where observers would drink pint after pint, looking out for the rituals of round-buying, rate of consumption, presence or absence of spittoons and sawdust, presence and absence (mostly the latter) of women, topics of conversation … And then nip off to the loo, both to ease their bladders and to scribble in their notebooks. 
 They also went to dances and the cinema; one of the unacknowledged perks for the young male observers was that they were not merely permitted but encouraged to pursue young women as much as they liked. Until the first female observers made the journey to Bolton, most of the data on women came from snogging sessions. The nature of the enterprise changed as the prospect of war grew closer and closer. After 1939, Mass Observation moved out of Bolton for good, and Harrisson brought his resources to the Ministry of Information, while Jennings joined the Crown Film Unit and Madge began to work for the Institute of Economic and Social Research; his work there helped JM Keynes to persuade parliament that workers would not object to additional taxes for the war effort. As Hall astutely notes, “Ultimately it led to some of the thinking behind the Beveridge report and the formation of the welfare state.” 
 Cynics might claim that the real and ugly legacies of MO have been the triumph of the surveillance culture and such obscenities of our time as so‑called “benefits porn” on network television. They would be wrong. Despite its flaws of condescension and its eccentricity, MO was a manifestation of the same impulse to enlighten, educate and ameliorate that drove many generous spirits of the 30s, from Orwell and Priestley to the British documentary film movement. They deserve to be remembered not only with amusement, but with admiration.
