For a brief shining moment in the mid-1990s, between Tony Blair ’s election as Labour leader and his entry to Downing Street in 1997, Will Hutton, then economics editor of this paper and soon to become the Observer’s editor, was the wonder of the age. His book The State We’re In, published in January 1995, and his concept of “stakeholder capitalism” offered an alternative to the profit-driven, short-termist free market that had developed in Britain during the 1980s. Companies’ decisions, Hutton argued, should have regard not only to their shareholders’ interests but also to those of their employees, suppliers and consumers, and indeed to the interests of the nation and the planet. That would give Britain higher and more consistent economic growth as well as a more equal and cohesive society. Stakeholder capitalism, some thought, was the “big idea” that the intellectually lightweight Blair needed to give an overarching theme to his imminent period in office. 
 Alas, though Blair used Hutton’s ideas in a couple of big speeches, stakeholding proved as shortlived as David Cameron’s “big society” 15 years later. The Labour left didn’t like the “capitalism” in “stakeholder capitalism”. The Labour right didn’t like “stakeholder”, which seemed to threaten business with more regulation and leave the Blair regime vulnerable to traditional Tory warnings of Labour red-tape. Rather than grapple with contentious reforms of company law, and risk losing the support of its newly acquired business supporters, Labour preferred to leave the free market undisturbed. Instead, it used burgeoning tax revenues to restore public services such as health and education and, as jobs became more insecure and wages took an ever smaller proportion of national income, to compensate capitalism’s victims through more generous welfare. Far from bringing the public interest to bear on the private sector, as Hutton demanded, New Labour brought the market and its values to bear on the public sector through devices such as the private finance initiative and the NHS internal market. 
 It didn’t help Hutton’s cause that the economies in Japan and Germany, the countries he held up as models for Britain to follow, stagnated over the next decade. The final death rattle of stakeholder capitalism can be dated to the second half of 2005 after Blair’s third election victory. A committee on company law, established in 1997, had deliberated for six long years before agreeing on a not very onerous requirement that companies publish an annual operating and financial review. This would, Hutton recalls, “give all stakeholders a rounded view of the company, its business purpose and how it was achieving it”. Blair vetoed the legislation lest, with an election looming, it was portrayed as “anti-business”. With Labour safely home, Gordon Brown stepped in to veto it again because he wanted something “pro-business” to say to the CBI conference. 
 Two years later, the financial crash began. Has Hutton’s hour come round again? Can stakeholder capitalism be resurrected? In this book, Hutton tries to give it new life. 
 When the British left is so bereft of vision and so tentative about the modest ideas it does have, Hutton comes as a breath of fresh air. Labour leaders, lamenting the decline in living standards but warning they cannot do much to reverse austerity, often sound Eeyorish. Hutton, by contrast, predicts a glorious future. Digitisation, he argues, is a General Purpose Technology (GPT) – like most visionaries, he has a weakness for capitalisation – which will transform our world even more than steam and electricity have. We are at a “dramatic moment in world history”. Twenty-first century life, he promises, will be like “none ever lived before”. All we have to do is “regain purpose and integrity”, and get ourselves smart government, smart companies and smart public services and we shall be “the world’s leading smart society”, smart being one of Hutton’s favourite adjectives. 
 So far, what we have seen of 21st-century life doesn’t seem to have many jobs in it, or at least not well-paid jobs giving anybody a regular, secure income. Amazon, for example, employs only 14 mostly ill-paid people for every US $10m (£6.5m) in sales; the high-street chains it is replacing employ three times as many for the equivalent sales volume. Hutton, however, believes digitisation will create new jobs, as every GPT did in the past. But since he says that this is “an economic inflexion point like no other”, it is not clear why we should be so confident. Nor is Hutton concerned by the prospect of a rich elite grabbing whatever gains are available. The elite is fragmenting, he insists, with a growing minority wanting a more responsible capitalism. It is a sign of how desperately small this minority is that Hutton includes in it Richard Branson, short-termist capitalist and tax avoider supreme. Still, as he points out, even the International Monetary Fund and the governor of the Bank of England talk about inequality these days. After all, if half the population lack decent and reliable incomes, they won’t be able to buy anything, digital or otherwise, and capitalism will simply grind to a halt. 
 Hutton says he isn’t anti-business, just anti-dysfunctional business. He wants more investment, more funds for research and development and a better trained workforce. He wants a new Companies Act to stipulate that the longer a share is held, the greater its holder’s voting rights. He wants legal title to property to be recognised only where the owner discloses his or her identity and pays tax. He wants better protection for mutuals, provision for a new entity called “a public benefit company” and a British sovereign-wealth fund comparable to those of Norway, Singapore and many other blamelessly capitalist countries. In other words, he doesn’t want socialism, just better capitalism. Ed Miliband would say that’s what he wants, too, and he could do worse than rescue Hutton’s stakeholder programme from the Blairite dustbin. The trouble, as Miliband has discovered and Blair feared, is that leaders of the corporate sector, particularly those providing “financial services” (services to whom?), are doing so well out of short-termist capitalism that they resist even modest attempts to ameliorate its negative long-term effects and portray such policies as “anti-business”. Moreover, governments of the past 30 years gave large numbers of voters, particularly older voters who are most likely to go to the ballot box, a vested interest in some of the worst effects of the present order, such as rising house prices and (through pension funds) soaring share values. 
 Indebted countries such as Greece are told they need “structural reform” which is code for lower wages, less job protection, less progressive taxation, selling off public assets and reducing public expenditure on welfare and social services. Increasingly, however, it is capitalism that needs structural reform, particularly in persuading private companies that, if they accept the state’s legal protection – in the form of limited liability, for example – they must accept reciprocal obligations to the wider community, not least the obligation to pay tax in full and on time. But reasonable as this sounds, the rich elite – who, as Hutton says, now regard avoiding taxes as a duty and evading them as morally understandable – will resist every inch of the way. Why wouldn’t they? They are sitting comfortably and will not risk their good fortune. Short-termist capitalism breeds short-term thinkers and they flourish in politics, industry and finance at the commanding heights of our society.
