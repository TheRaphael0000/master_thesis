It’s 1935, and Delphine Venner’s father has suffered a breakdown. The family has come to seek sanctuary in Alderberen Hall, a gargoyle-guarded pile in rural Norfolk. Here, Mr Propp’s sinister Society (50% calisthenics on the lawn, 50% skulduggery) appears to have a malign hold on the Hall – and, far worse, there is something nasty in the woods. 
 Neither the Society nor the nastiness is a match for Delphine, who may have the body of a weak and feeble schoolgirl, but has the heart and stomach of a king – together with his generals, his infantrymen, his army surgeons and all his enemies. What’s more, she can spot an 1873 Winchester lever-action rifle at 50 paces, and – in due course – fire it too. Armed with a crab-hook and a daughter’s devotion, she sets about unravelling which of the Society’s members are heroes, which are villains, and whether the Bolsheviks have anything to do with it. 
 There’s an early moment in poet Tim Clare ’s debut novel when I sighed contentedly, assured of being in the hands of a storyteller who knows what his reader wants, and isn’t shy of giving plenty of it. The book begins with a glimpse at events towards its climax, as Delphine and elderly gamekeeper Garforth plot an assault on grim creatures evidently laying siege to the Hall. Delphine soaks her bruises in a tub while Garforth prepares a supper of calves’ brains, and the entire scene is rendered in such careful detail it’s possible to smell the foaming butter, to hear the ticking of the carriage clock. It all indicates the creation of a world so fully realised that when vast and baleful bats show up sporting quilted leather jerkins, you take them entirely on trust. 
 There is a large cast of characters, all of them so gratifyingly what the reader would demand of a fantasy novel set between the wars in Norfolk that they seem almost familiar: the gruff housekeeper, the suspiciously elegant lady, the ancient aristocrat long since deprived of his marbles. Which is not to say that they are thin, or unsatisfactory: they are of the variety EM Forster called “easily recognised whenever they come in – recognised by the reader’s emotional eye”. 
 The comparisons that most readily spring to mind are with the wildly eccentric and benevolent imaginations of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett (indeed, grieving Pratchett fans will be consoled by the frequent appearance of humorous little footnotes). In keeping with the best fantasy fiction, this novel is about a great deal more than creeping monsters and steampunk sensibilities; that it is set between the wars is unapologetically significant. Delphine’s father has one foot still in the trenches, while her own preoccupation with firearms signals Europe’s unease as the clouds of war blacken and gather. 
 That Clare has a poet’s eye and ear is apparent throughout: quite aside from the pleasures of story, the prose is frequently a delight, and occasionally couched in the iambs and dactyls of verse. The sea is “stippled with milk-white flakes”, while “lawns spread ripe and unbounded”, and “the distant treeline hung like an unresolved chord”. The author’s evident delight in language grows faintly exhausting as the novel wears on: there are passages in which scarcely an object is permitted to exist without being compared to something else, and a good many peregrinations that do little to further the plot (the correct preparation of tea; the savaging of a rabbit by stoats). Events that could be expressed in a paragraph frequently run to several pages, taking in a witty exchange, the painstaking cataloguing of every single gesture, and descriptive passages which would sit well in a nature writing anthology. 
 But to complain would seem churlish – a little like refusing a generous host offering many successive plates of petits fours. Besides, this impatience is testimony to the intriguing premise of the story itself, and to Delphine’s enormous charm. Elegantly phrased diversions are all very well, but what we really want to know is how this curious schoolgirl wound up in the grounds of a stately home, intent on blasting monsters to kingdom come with a hand grenade. 
 In 2009, Clare published a memoir entitled We Can’t All Be Astronauts, in which he meditated, with mordant wit, on his failure to match the success of his friends. Well: on the evidence of this gorgeously entertaining novel, it would appear he passed the intervening years storing up a considerable quantity of rocket fuel.
