I would probably read a shopping list written by Chris Adrian. He is one of the most accomplished novelists of his generation, whose interests combine the technological with the theological without ever losing sight of the human. His novels are dream-hauntingly surreal – a 19th-century surgeon and necromancer building a machine to bring back the civil war dead ( Gob’s Grief ); a paediatric hospital which becomes an ark in a miraculously flooded world (The Children’s Hospital); a group of homeless people staging a musical version of 70s sci-fi film Soylent Green as Titania and Puck turn up in a San Francisco park (The Great Night) – and yet the strangeness never overwhelms the stark, eternal verities of death, love, grace and loss. The New World shares the same themes. Jane Cotton, a surgeon, learns on returning from a conference that her husband Jim, a “humanist chaplain” in the same hospital, has died from a massive embolism. But that isn’t the only shock. His head is missing. Unbeknownst to her, Jim has left his head to Polaris Cryonics, in the hope that one day medical techniques will have advanced to the point where he can be resurrected. After a broadly realist first chapter, we turn to Jim: “In the absence of a mouth and a tongue, in the absence of air, he asked, Am I alive? You have always been alive, he was told. But now you are awake.” 
 Before continuing with the novel, it is best to consider what makes it unusual as a text. The New World was written in collaboration with Eli Horowitz, and originally published in a digital-only format by Atavist Books. Horowitz, who describes The New World as “a single path travelled three times, a story being retold and reinterpreted”, has also collaborated on two other “digital novels”. The Silent History, with Kevin Moffett and Matthew Derby, was presented as oral histories describing a generation of children born seemingly without language, with parts of the story unlocked at specific locations on GPS-activated devices. Some of it worked very well, and the collaborative form gave a sense of the different parties responding to and subverting developments in the narrative. The Clock Without a Face, written with Mac Barnett, combined a mystery novel with a real-life treasure hunt. Having read The New World only in codex form puts me at a slight disadvantage, but I can say that as a paper-and-ink novel it is immensely affecting and nuanced. The potential for “non-linear reading” isn’t peculiar to digital texts: Ali Smith’s How to Be Both, Mark Danielewski’s Only Revolutions, Julio Cort&aacute;zar’s Hopscotch and Ian Livingstone’s The Warlock of Firetop Mountain all have aleatory structures. While in the book version, each of the three sections is shorter than the one before, the digital version, according to an interview with Horowitz in Shelf Unbound, fills the last 53 pages with “the couple’s marriage vows repeated in italic, repeating page after page and then slowly fading out”. In the book, it’s just a sonnet-long block of italics. Would one read 53 pages, or skim them? Would the effect be hypnotic, purgatorial (which would fit thematically), a descent into the meaningless or a koan-like progress to enlightenment? Readers, I trust, will differ on this. 
 As an old-fashioned novel it is nevertheless a forward-looking, clever and elegiac piece of work. As Jane struggles to retrieve her husband’s head from Polaris, the book is by turns satirical and conspiratorial. I particularly liked that the company demands that would-be customers describe why they deserve immortality in 120 characters or fewer. Jim, meanwhile, comes to realise that immortality comes with quite a high price tag. His preparations for his return involve a kind of afterlife art therapy, as the yet-to-be-reborn strive to detach themselves from their former lives. For some, this is so painful that suicide seems the only option. The book also explores some deep truths about death and dying. “There’s another way to be alive,” one character realises. “To have been alive. I don’t understand it myself.” From the perspective of timelessness, we are always immortal, in the same way as Vonnegut’s Tralfamadorians saw history as a series of mountain peaks, simultaneous and unchangeable. 
 The subsequent returns to Jim and Jane’s story reveal the reasons for his secretive transfer of his head to Polaris, and the meaning behind the moving (albeit slightly cheesy) wedding vows. The book manages to debunk their romantic protestations then subtly re-enchant them. For all its metaphysical riffs, it is a sardonically moving dissection of the ironies and glories of marriage. 
 I will, of course, read whatever Adrian writes next, but I am equally fascinated by Horowitz’s next collaboration. He may not yet have cracked creating a literary work that exists solely in a digital environment, but he has done more than most to advance the concept.
