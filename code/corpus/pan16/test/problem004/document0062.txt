‘In literature we move through a blest world in which we know nothing except by style, but in which also everything is saved by it.” So wrote Henry James in his Notebooks. It will seem to some an overly sweeping claim – everything is saved? – but it was one of the mottoes by which James lived and wrote. His late novels are practically all style, and we grope our way about in them as in a golden mist of words, never quite sure of what is going on but feeling that something is indeed being salvaged from the general wreckage of life. 
 In A Christmas Garland, Max Beerbohm wrote a splendid parody of James’s late style entitled “The Mote in the Middle Distance”, by which the Master was distinctly unamused. This was rather prissy of him, for although the squib was aimed with uncanny accuracy – “It was with the sense of a, for him, very memorable something that he peered now into the immediate future, and tried, not without compunction, to take that period up where he had, prospectively, left it” – there was not a trace of malice in it. 
 Beerbohm was a wonderful caricaturist, in words and images, but he never sought to wound. In his essay “The Spirit of Caricature”, he wrote: “If caricature affected us at all towards its subject, it would affect us favourably towards it. Tragedy, said Aristotle, purges us of superfluous awe, by evocation, and comedy likewise purges us of superfluous contempt.” Beerbohm was insistent on the centrality of humour, in life and in art, but he was every bit as convinced as James as to the saving grace of literary style. What he said of the dandy Count D’Orsay, that he was “too fond of life and other follies to achieve real greatness”, might well have been said of him, too, yet when we read him we find ourselves wondering if mere greatness is really the thing to be aspired to, after all. 
 Beerbohm was born in London in 1872, the son of a Lithuanian grain merchant and an English mother. It was assumed by many that he was Jewish – the antisemite Ezra Pound sneered at him in the Cantos as “Brennbaum, ‘The Impeccable’” – but it seems he had no Jewish blood, to his expressed regret. While at university he fell in enthusiastically with a circle of aesthetes in London that included Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley. This led to speculation that he was homosexual, but again he was able to deny the rumours, this time without regret. In 1910 he met and married the American actor Florence Kahn and moved with her to Rapallo – Pound was a neighbour – where they lived for the rest of their lives. 
 His first book, published in 1896, he wittily titled The Works of Max Beerbohm – he was all of 24. Later he worked as a theatre critic on the influential Saturday Review, taking up the post from George Bernard Shaw, who in his last piece for the magazine archly welcomed his successor as “the Incomparable Max”, hence Pound’s gibe. The epithet stuck, to Beerbohm’s irritation. The fact is, however, he was incomparable. Oh, and by the way, he got his own back on Shaw with a review of a book of dialogues by the playwright: “His characters come from out his own yearning heart. Only, we can find no corner for them in ours.” 
 Despite its solid middle-class position in society, the Beerbohm family had a distinctly raffish side. Max’s half-brother was Herbert Beerbohm Tree, whose two daughters both went on the stage; his third daughter, Iris Tree, was painted by various artists including Modigliani, who did a lush nude of her in 1916. Beerbohm Tree also had seven illegitimate children, including Carol Reed – director of The Third Man – whose nephew was the actor and hellraiser Oliver Reed. 
 These showbiz connections would no doubt have amused Max, but as a young man he would surely have disapproved of his relatives, however mildly. Among the Yellow Book crowd he cultivated a highly exquisite manner. Phillip Lopate, in his fine introduction to The Prince of Minor Writers – a slightly unfortunate title – tells us that Wilde “was disconcerted by Beerbohm’s imperturbable manner, and asked a mutual friend, ‘When you are alone with him, does he take off his face and reveal his mask?’” Yet the pose of frosty disdain was just that – a pose. Inside that imperturbable exterior he was shaking with mirth, delighted as he was by the world and its sillinesses. “Only the insane,” he declared, “take themselves quite seriously.” 
 Although he worked in many forms, literary and pictorial, he was, he said, first and foremost an essayist, and this handsome and substantial volume amply proves him right. Lopate has made a generous and well-judged selection. Beerbohm’s range was seemingly limitless, and he could take the most trivial subject and work up something from it that is unforgettable. In “How Shall I Word It?”, one of the first pieces here, he mocks, mercilessly, yet with peculiar gentleness, a how-to manual on letter-writing for poorly educated aspirants to the epistolary art, while “A Memory of a Midnight Express” will entrance all who love trains and win over many of those who don’t. He declared himself to be a “Tory anarchist”, and his little essay “Servants” shows him at his most anarchic: “I should like every one to go about doing just as he pleased – short of altering any of the things to which I have grown accustomed. Domestic service is not one of those things, and I should be glad were there no more of it.” 
 He is unflaggingly funny, without ever straining for a laugh. Here he is at the opera: “These little marionettes with big voice, making so gigantic a pother about something or other, have keen pathos in my sight – types of our poor estate, of our vanity, our pompous endeavouring, our insignificance, on the world’s stage. See! The wee tenor is going to kill himself with a dagger. No! The wee soprano prevents him. Tiny, intelligent, full of purpose, performing with all their might tasks for which I see no reason, they seem to me – these two – like a pair of ants on a pathway.” 
 Each reader will have a favourite one among these essays, but “A Clergyman” surely captures him at his funniest, most humane and most tender. The clergyman in question makes a single appearance in Boswell’s Life of Samuel Johnson, darting out of anonymity to utter a faint protest against one of the Great Cham’s obiter dicta, and being swatted like a fly for his temerity. Beerbohm goes among the company, as it were, and leads out once more into the light the poor hot-faced fellow, intent on giving him his kindly due. “Fragmentary, pale, momentary; almost nothing; glimpsed and gone; as it were, a faint human hand thrust up, never to reappear, from beneath the rolling waters of time, he forever haunts my memory and solicits my imagination.” 
 Beerbohm is not as disregarded as Johnson’s misfortunate victim, but the New York Review of Books and Lopate have earned our thanks by returning him so gloriously to our attention. He knew his place in the grand scheme of literature, and made no boastful claims for himself and his work, yet he remains not only delightful company but a figure of moral weight as well. Writing of Beau Brummell, of all people, Beerbohm gives us, unintentionally, a beautifully limned sketch of himself: “Like the single-minded artist that he was, he turned full and square towards his art and looked life straight in the face out of the corners of his eyes.”
