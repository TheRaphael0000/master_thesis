There is an episode about halfway through this book that achieves something like structural perfection. The main character, Andy, politically charged but permanently mortified by self-consciousness, has gone to Bosnia in the early 1990s to perform a “play of peace” with some students who are much posher than he is. (He works in construction.) “Posh,” he observes at the beginning of the novel, “it turns out, is actually rather common. ‘Grand’ and ‘smart’ are the words the posh use to describe homes and people and parties that are very posh.” 
 The group has been advised to seek back-up from some British mercenaries, and has just arrived at the campfire of these cut-price tough guys. Andy, spurning advice and looking for privacy to do a shit, walks into a minefield – a fact he only discovers as the guns-for-hire start to yell at him on his way out. The pressure builds expertly as his ironic detachment meets, and is completely unequal to, the possibility that he might be blown up. He thinks he sees indifference on the faces of his friends. I’ve never read a lonelier near-death experience. “Then, before I took the first step, something I would never have normally done seemed suddenly possible in this extra, super-oxygenated pocket of life. I looked up and shouted, ‘I like you, Penny!’ and took the step. If there had been an explosion then, the scene might have ended well. As it was, with no explosion, she was left to smile and say, ‘Oh.’ And, ‘Thank you!”… I looked at Penny and the way she smiled, revealing no teeth and then looking at the ground, improved my situation a little, in that I now actively wanted to die.” 
 The unblinking intimacy of this self-examination – no deficiency too trivial, no humiliation too small or too keen – gives it an irresistible momentum, like disappearing into the vortex of someone else’s panic attack. It is funny for the reasons that bind Peep Show and The Thick of It, both co-written by Armstrong; not just for the explosions or one liners, though there are plenty of those, but the way that the scenario says: “You think I’ve said everything there is to say about people, their pettiness, their confusion, the tragic obviousness of their yearnings? Not quite … ” It sounds like misanthropy, but it’s more like unconditional love – to see so many flaws and keep on looking. 
 From the outset, the narrator’s voice insists on the absurdity of every character, even – sometimes, especially – the person he is in love with. No one is more ridiculous, more riddled with inconsistency and ego, than he is himself; often, all that can drag him out of his mire is the realisation that other people, while nothing like as bad as he is, are at least far from perfect. “I … wondered how do we have the balls, all of us, to walk around with our faces, these great meat plates, every thought baldly plastered across them?” 
 As a worldview, it is instantly likable: arch enough not to be vulnerable, critical enough of the world at large not to be its victim. That makes the book sound smoother than it is; for Andy’s journey, ultimately, is not towards self-realisation, nor to a more mature view of foreign policy, in which everybody is implicated to some degree. Rather, he marches, dutifully, as if he deserves it, towards disappointment, as each of his worst fears are realised, but in a smaller, less exciting way. 
 There is a trace of Martin Amis in Armstrong’s fascinated disgust – of Bev, a mercenary, Andy notes: “His big shoulders under his black T-shirt spoke of a bull’s power packed into a human’s skin. Just looking at the red swelling spots across his neck, you could feel their angry tautness, the pressure of the pus mantle beneath.” But it is no more than a trace, a mineral ingested two decades ago, washed down with some Stone Roses tracks: the book has a strong flavour of the 90s but also unearths something new from the era. “I think it’s possible my generation … grew up always looking out for the opposite. Always ready to spot an irony, a twist. Expecting, almost, every park tramp to be a professor fallen on hard times … ” It was a decade of fetish-building, everything seen through a mask; at the time, the irony was gleeful, pugilistic and, above all, delicious. That mood – personified by Amis, Christopher Hitchens, Julian Barnes et al – ceded in the end to an entirely different crowd, with an entirely different sensibility (David Peace, Andrew O’Hagan, Zadie Smith ). Armstrong goes back to that fin de siecle artifice, disinters it to find something joltingly true: that the fear of reality, for all its comic potential, strangled real-life human connection. A subplot embodies this in an audaciously frank way, with Penny’s brother, Von, constantly looking for hand-jobs but refraining from penetration because of his fear of Aids. 
 I admire the book, above all, because it never has to switch voices, or drop its mordant wit for something more sober, when the corpses arrive. Armstrong’s comic voice is versatile, original, unabashed; deployed to reveal rather than obscure. It fits him like a skin.
