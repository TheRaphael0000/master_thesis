When we first encounter Robert Hendricks, narrator of Sebastian Faulks’s novel of madness and memory, he is in guilty flight from New York. It is 1980, the city is at its lowest ebb, and Hendricks is escaping a dismal encounter with a call girl. Washed up in the doldrums of what he is later to term “a century of psychosis”, never did a physician so transparently need to heal himself. 
 Austerity Britain may be long gone and Hendricks a veteran of the Anzio landings and a successful doctor and author, but the London of bedsits, drycleaners and transients he returns to recalls Greeneland, a place of obscure shame: his name even echoes that of Graham Greene’s Maurice Bendrix from The End of the Affair. Hendricks also brings to mind John le Carr&eacute; ’s cold war burnout Alec Leamas, a man living a lonely, comfortless life, haunted by failure and in exile from his past. Hendricks’s mother is dead, a father he never knew was killed in the first world war and lovers have receded, apparently out of reach. 
 As his latest desultory affair atrophies, with only his increasingly wary dog, Max, for company, Hendricks has an overwhelming sense of the profound unreality of his own existence, and of impending despair. Dogged by guilt, as strange accusatory phone messages appear on his answerphone and his memory plays tricks, he realises the cause of what feels like his own descent into mental illness must be buried deep in his past, somewhere between a lost father, wartime trauma, a treacherous lover and a life spent treating the damaged. Yet blocked by his own training and stern rationalism, as well as fear of what he may discover, Hendricks finds it impossible to make sense of his own past. 
 And then comes a mysterious invitation to visit the elderly Alexander Pereira, a retired psychiatrist specialising in dementia, on his peninsula off the south of France. Pereira admires Hendricks’s study of madness and therapy, and he is looking for a literary executor for his own work. Most crucially, though, he offers Hendricks a past, or at least a vital fragment of one: as an officer in the first world war Pereira had a fateful encounter with Hendricks’s father before his death. Following some instinct buried under his rationalism, Hendricks leaves grey London for the cicadas and palm trees of the Mediterranean, where naked girls dive from the rocks for sea urchins and where Pereira presides over his islet, holding out hope in the form of a sepia photograph and a version of the talking cure tailored to Hendricks’s needs. 
 Part Prospero, part Dr Moreau, Pereira has his own odd hinterland of lost love and failed experiments, and although his motives for drawing Hendricks out remain veiled, he nudges him towards an investigation of the trauma he is evading. And finally Hendricks begins to talk. 
 Combining as it does the cultural narrative of a complex century forsaken by God and certainty, a serious investigation of the vulnerability of the human mind and an old-fashioned – in the best sense – story of love and war, this is an ambitious, demanding and profoundly melancholy novel. To choose as narrator an austere and alienated intellectual, a man who find fault with Einstein’s prose, repudiates love as a matter of dopamine and neurotransmitters and calls solitude not second nature but “first nature … no more than an enactment of being human” is a risky strategy; Hendricks is not easily lovable, in particular when dealing with women. From his timid, indistinct mother, up to and including his one great love affair in postwar Italy, he seems to regard them with a kind of queasy helplessness, as one after another potential companion slips through his fingers. And in the aftermath of the traumatic loss of the only woman he really loved, there is a scene in which, as a tour guide tries to seduce him in an uninhabited apartment, he is actually repellent. 
 But in the end, Faulks’s integrity and intelligence bring us round, along with a command of the visceral minutiae of life and death. His superlative descriptions of war, the relationships formed under the extreme pressure it exerts and its aftermath (the “desperate grandeur” of postwar Naples, the burning paper houses of Hiroshima), are what guide us through difficult territory to precisely the transcendence Hendricks has spent his life denying. It is a reminder to both narrative and narrator that memory and art are made of fine detail and not always the bigger picture.
