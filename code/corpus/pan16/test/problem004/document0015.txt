Kate Atkinson’s previous novel, Life After Life, played an ingenious game with time. Over and over again, Ursula Todd is born on 11 February 1910; over and over again, she dies – at birth, or drowning at the beach aged five, or falling out of a window, aged five again. Or of influenza, four times, in 1918. The first time she dies of influenza, she is tended to the last by her broken-hearted mother. The second time, her little brother Teddy, her mother’s favourite, has also just died of the virus; her mother, demented with grief, hardly has attention to spare for poor Ursula. During her third bout of influenza, something begins to leak through to Ursula from those other selves, warning her, making her feel an incoherent dread, turning her into an odd little person, dreamy and haunted. Until she dies anyway – and then is born again. Eventually, dreamy and haunted still, she pushes past 1918, and on to her future deaths. 
 Atkinson’s new novel, A God in Ruins, picks up the story of the Todd family, but arranges it this time around the perspective of sweet-natured, affectionate, beautiful Teddy, Ursula’s beloved brother, his mother’s golden boy. And what happens in A God in Ruins just happens – there are no second chances or different versions. Teddy doesn’t ever catch influenza (as indeed he doesn’t in most of the timelines in Life After Life ); he grows up to become a bomber pilot in the second world war. Against all the odds he survives the war, marries his childhood sweetheart Nancy, and lives on into old age. At the core of the book is the discovery that the glorious Teddy, whose death in Life After Life seemed such a wrenching and archetypal loss, might actually, if he’d survived, be rather dull. In the earlier novel we circled round the charm of his existence, along with all those women who adored him. In this later book we’re allowed inside Teddy himself, and there just isn’t very much there. 
 No, that’s not fair. Teddy is decent, courageous, selfless, practical: the stuff heroes are made from. He’s the man you’d want as your skipper, say, in a frail little Halifax, staggering back through a thunderstorm from night raids over Turin, with ice on the wings. It’s better in this situation – Teddy knows – not to have too much imagination. The bombing raids are the heart of the new novel and the best thing in it, the scrupulous research and the technicalities absorbed inside the vivid realisation of the appalling, exacting, exhilarating moment-by-moment experience. 
 Perhaps it was too much to ask of any man, to be everybody’s golden boy, carrying their promise and hope into the wars of the first half of the 20th century. Golden boys are best left behind in childhood – like the grubby, cheeky, perpetually resilient Augustus, in the children’s books inspired by young Teddy and written by his Aunt Izzy. And after the extended trauma of Teddy’s war, it’s no surprise that everything else in his long life feels like a postscript. 
 But it does pose a problem for the novel. It feels sometimes as though the centrality of the war experience in A God in Ruins sucks conviction out of the rest of the material: Teddy’s disappointing marriage to Nancy, or the story of his blisteringly angry daughter Viola, who can’t forgive him for her mother’s early death, and lives her life as one long petulant protest against the values Teddy imagines he fought for. The novel doesn’t quite bind together as a whole, and the writing can feel slack. This seems to be partly connected with the way it so determinedly upsets chronological order. It opens in 1944, jumps back to Teddy’s childhood in 1925, then jumps forward to 1980, when Viola is struggling in a hippy commune with her two small children – she is a neglectful mother, and her children get on much better with their grandfather. Then it drops back to the immediate postwar period before Viola was born, then into the thick of the war – and so on, backwards and forwards. In the latest present, Viola’s a successful novelist and Teddy’s in an old people’s home, then a nursing home. 
 Novelists can do what they like with time, of course – and these juxtapositions torn out of chronological sequence can be creatively unsettling, making us see any present moment differently, by bringing it into relation with a long view. And the same principle is at work even inside the sections of A God in Ruins: different time frames are contained on the same page, within the same paragraph. One summer afternoon in 1925, for example, while 11-year-old Teddy is wondering how he’ll get on at boarding school and politely tolerating Aunt Izzy’s research for her Augustus books (“Have you ever eaten a worm? Do you play at cowboys and Indians?”), we hear of a poem his daughter will send him in the 1970s, and then that “When it came to it, school life was not so bad as he had feared” – all in passing, before we’re returned to inside that summer’s afternoon when neither of those things has happened yet. Teddy and Nancy both get leave in 1943 and spend it together by the sea, and he proposes, or perhaps she does – and then in the midst of that scene we’re pulled briefly forward to their marriage after the war, at Chelsea register office, although Teddy in 1943 could only have expected “to die at any given moment”. 
 The risk of playing these time games is that, if the view’s too long and the habit’s too inveterate, all the novel’s present moments can seem to be flattened into one same moment, with the same flavour, eliminating the deep differences of history and cultural change. It is interesting that the premise of Life After Life, so flauntingly counterfactual, produces nonetheless an urgent forward movement, the real sensation of time passing and taking its toll. Because Ursula could be born over and over, her life might have come to feel weightless to readers, as if her death didn’t matter – and yet it has the opposite effect. Her numerous lives, instead of thinning her out, thicken her up, as if we are witness to the making of a self through the multiple collisions of character and accident; the novel is wonderful, a tour de force. The different counterfactual deployed in A God in Ruins – that its time periods are all adjacent, like rooms in a house, and that we can pass easily backwards and forwards between them – actually seems more undermining of the novel’s power. A God in Ruins is full of good arguments against forgetting. Yet it seems as if we can’t truly remember the past until we’ve measured how completely we’ve lost it.
