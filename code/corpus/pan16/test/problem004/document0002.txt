Sara Taylor’s debut, a book of interlinked short stories already longlisted for the Baileys women’s prize for fiction, opens with a 13-year-old buying chicken necks to use as crab bait. Ordinarily, Chloe tells us, she would prefer bacon rinds, but “we’ve eaten those already”. In the store, she observes that her fellow customer has “more of an equator than a waist”, before joining in the chat about a recent murder – “they done cut his thang clean off! … I couldn’t help but hear it.” 
 Chloe lives on a lush, isolated redneck island off the coast of Virginia, and with her alluring blend of adult wit, childish sensibility and terrifying pragmatism at first seems to be a classic southern-gothic child heroine in the tradition of Carson McCullers’ The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter. Except that here everything is marvellously speeded up: where McCullers’ protagonist spends most of a book thinking about music and hanging out on street corners, Chloe’s world is full of imminent violence. In short order, she pays for the bloody necks, introduces us to some local witch doctors, takes her little sister home and does some horribly convincing practice with a slug-loaded shotgun: “If I can’t get it loaded in time I can probably beat someone’s head in with it; the bitch is heavy.” Chloe’s mother is dead, her father smokes crack, she knows too much about the aforementioned murder, and we are only on page five. 
 The next story does something similar, this time to Flannery O’Connor. Taylor places us, O’Connor-style, in 1933, in a barn amid “hay dust swimming in the light like mosquito fry in a rain barrel”, with two doomed, class-bound and sexually forthright protagonists; but then, instead of leaving us to suck up the dust and moral responsibility, as O’Connor surely would, she whizzes us through a novel’s worth of action in a couple of future tense paragraphs, all the way to a happy(ish) ending. 
 We gallop on. A third tale takes us into modernised Eudora Welty territory with a family of witch doctors who raise hurricanes alongside their corn and collard greens; a fourth into a drastically reimagined Gone With the Wind -style scenario starring a mixed-race belle with a frightening medicine cabinet; and a fifth into a Margaret Atwood -style dystopian future, all genetic mutations, new diseases and rampant returning primitivism. All of which tells us that 24-year-old Taylor, “home-educated” in Virginia, must have spent a lot of her childhood reading books; perhaps flat out on the floor like Chloe’s little sister Renee, absorbing the cold and her southern-gothic heritage though her tummy. 
 But Chloe and Renee don’t have electricity, and it seems that Taylor must have watched an awful lot of box sets too. “Interwoven short stories” usually means nebulously linked character studies, strenuously packaged by a publisher in the hope we will mistake them for a novel. Taylor’s pieces, though, really are joined: linked by several mini-series’ worth of backstory and a perfect circuit board of a family tree; not too little plot to put in a novel, but too much. To find the connections between stories, you have to follow names, places and even objects through 200 years of timeline. You find yourself flipping backwards and forwards, tracing the fate of a copper brandy still from 1919, searching out exactly who Cabel Bloxom, the man without a “thang”, was related to; who built Chloe’s house; and who will live there after most of the population has died of super-fast cock-rotting disease. It’s a strange but pleasurable way to read, an experience at once postmodern and childish, like cheating on a drama by fast-forwarding, or consuming a book as little Renee does, several times and backwards. 
 Sometimes, like any box set, the stories deliver twists that seem superfluous. Similarly, the time scheme sometimes winds itself into conundrums that can only be resolved by one character gratuitously confessing, in lengthy, uninterrupted paragraphs, a life plan that just happens to be an important plot link: “If the goal is preservation of humanity, then there is some hope,” says survivalist Mo, unconvincingly outlining the design of a future disease-proof colony to a niece she has only just met. And all the way through the book, as on TV, character trumps history: Medora has a delightful but surely unlikely sense of feminism for 1876; while Letty, in 1933, is well acquainted with therapy-speak: “You’re not ready to be a man. Fair enough, that’s your choice to make. But please, don’t question my choices.” None of these problems will make you stop reading, though, any more than they would make you turn off the telly: you want to know what happens next. 
 There is another effect of this knotted creeper of plot and family: the three islands that make up the “Shore” of the title come to seem more constant than any of their inhabitants. The green, lush landscape, the oyster beds, insects and crabs, are evoked through so many eyes and felt by so many hands that we start to believe in their enduring existence, giving backbone and depth to the green politics of the book. The feminism, too, is more than gelding knives and witchcraft: the exoticism of the Medora stories is set off by two plain and compelling pieces about misogyny, “Skirt” and “Boys”. Taylor, it seems, can do dark realism as well as she can the magic kind – in fact, she seems able to do most things. This debut is a testament to an exuberant talent and an original, fearless sensibility. It’s also enormous fun to read.
