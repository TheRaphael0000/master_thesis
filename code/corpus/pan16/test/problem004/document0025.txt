At the Menil Foundation, a huge Renzo Piano -designed museum in Houston, Texas, there hangs a painting by Joshua Reynolds of “A Young Black”. The sitter has high cheekbones and a face that is dignified, solemn, even sad. The image is often reproduced and is widely believed to be a likeness of Francis Barber, who is today known for having been the manservant of Samuel Johnson and the chief beneficiary of his will. 
 In his lifetime Barber was regarded as the great lexicographer’s chattel, rather than as a person of interest in his own right. He was referred to as “the Doctor’s negro servant”; among the nicknames foisted on him were “poor Blacky” and “the Ethiopian”. Modern accounts tend to be hazy or wayward. In Adam Hochschild’s Bury the Chains, an impressive history of British anti-slavery, Barber is described as Johnson’s “valet-butler-secretary”, and in Robert Winder’s Bloody Foreigners he is “a poet and protege of Johnson”. Michael Bundock sets out to correct such narrow or inexact senses of Barber’s existence. His crisply written, empathetic biography scrupulously documents Barber’s life and illuminates the experiences of black Britons in the 18th century. 
 Johnson and Barber were, as Bundock says, a “conspicuously odd” couple. When Barber arrived at Johnson’s household, in April 1752, he was 10 years old and had just emerged from two years at an obscure Yorkshire boarding school. Johnson was 42 and intimidating – a man of large stature and intellect. His wife had died the previous month, and he was making only fitful progress with his Dictionary of the English Language. Childless and prone to debilitating bouts of melancholy, he was not an obvious candidate to take charge of a 10-year-old boy. What was more, his four-storey house in Gough Square off London’s Fleet Street was a kind of drop-in centre for local unfortunates, and Barber had to share living space with several difficult individuals, among them the irascible blind poet Anna Williams. 
 The culture shock was profound. Barber had begun life in Jamaica, on a sugar plantation belonging to Colonel Richard Bathurst, the father of a friend of Johnson’s (also called Richard Bathurst). When the plantation was sold in 1749, Bathurst senior chose to make his home in England and brought the seven-year-old Barber with him. Exactly why remains unclear. Perhaps the boy was a status symbol or potentially useful factotum, though another plausible explanation – which Bundock doesn’t rule out – is that he was Bathurst’s illegitimate son. 
 To afford us an idea of the kind of existence Barber escaped, Bundock quotes from the diaries of Thomas Thistlewood, an English slave-owner who arrived in Jamaica in 1750 and exhaustively recorded his predatory sex life and the punishments he inflicted on slaves he thought had misbehaved (“Derby … eating canes. Had him well flogged and pickled, then made Hector shit in his mouth”). 
 The indignities of life in England were less extreme, but Barber faced prejudice. Hostility to black people was being stirred up by a new breed of pro-slavery propagandist. In 1765 the London Chronicle printed a reader’s proposal for a tax on black servants who “are become too abundant in this kingdom”. Now, 250 years on, the gripes have a familiar ring, especially when the author asserts that “In their employments they … stand in the way of our own people”. Seven years later a pamphlet by the historian Edward Long complained that lower-class women “are remarkably fond of the blacks, for reasons too brutal to mention” and fretted that “in the course of a few generations more, the English blood will become … contaminated”. In 1778 Philip Thicknesse, a self-publicist known for his provocative turn of phrase, wrote that in “every town, nay in almost every village, are to be seen a little race of mulattoes, mischievous as monkeys and infinitely more dangerous”. 
 Johnson’s views were very different. He believed in the uniformity of human nature and, accustomed to being called “barbarous” and “a savage” on account of his strange mannerisms, had some understanding of what it was like to be the object of mistrust. But although Johnson was a sympathetic employer, Barber did not wait long to leave Gough Square when he received a bequest of £12 from Colonel Bathurst in 1756. He found work with an apothecary and then, in the summer of 1758, joined the navy. Johnson would in due course claim that Barber “ran away to sea”, and modern accounts have either reproduced this wording or stated that he was seized by a press gang. Yet, as Bundock shows, Barber volunteered, in the hope of greater freedom and better financial prospects. 
 This bid for independence did not impress Johnson. He would later tell his biographer James Boswell that “No man will be a sailor who has contrivance enough to get himself into jail; for being in a ship is being in a jail, with the chance of being drowned.” He was sufficiently anxious to get Barber discharged from the navy that he sought the help of the radical MP John Wilkes – no small thing to do, as they had clashed over Wilkes’s stinging criticisms of the Dictionary when it finally appeared in 1755. Bundock characterises Johnson’s efforts as “heavy-handed”, and Barber certainly didn’t appreciate them. But Johnson’s paternal interest continued. He paid for Barber to attend the well-regarded grammar school in Bishop’s Stortford and considered having him prepared for a role as a missionary. 
 Barber finally did become more independent in January 1773, when he married Elizabeth Ball. She was white, and uncharitable observers were quick to liken the newlyweds to Othello and Desdemona. The union produced three children. Their firstborn, Samuel, died aged 14 months; when they had another son, they again chose the name Samuel. This was a testament to Barber’s affection for Johnson, and their relationship deepened in the essayist’s final years; Barber was one of two people present when he died, and Johnson left him a tidy lump sum and an annuity of £70 – a respectable amount, given that Barber and his wife had up till then been earning £31 a year between them. 
 Johnson had advised Barber to move to Lichfield, his own home town and somewhere he could live more cheaply than in London “and with fewer temptations”. Barber complied and found himself treated as a minor celebrity, though his standing was damaged by the publication of a volume with the title More Last Words of Dr Johnson by “Francis, Barber” – the comma a clue, widely overlooked, that this grubby hotchpotch had been put together by another Francis, who professed to have had the honour of dressing Johnson’s wig. There were other assaults on his reputation. Johnson’s executor Sir John Hawkins accused him of extravagance and meanness. Hawkins’s biography of Johnson, published in 1787, ended not with a tribute to its august subject, but instead with an attack on Barber, culminating in the claim that his profligacy “may serve as a caveat against ostentatious bounty [and] favour to negroes”. 
 It is typical of Bundock’s judicious approach that he examines the grievances of Hawkins, rather than simply dismissing him as a racist or falling back on the standard view that he was an unclubbable brute. Bundock depicts with great care Barber’s final years – which were dismayingly penurious, given the size of Johnson’s legacy, and which included an attempt to set up a school, possibly making him Britain’s first black schoolmaster. He imaginatively recreates the textures of life in 18th-century England and shows an admirable determination to question received wisdom – which results in his disappointingly, but I think correctly, scotching the seductive notion that Barber was the solemn figure painted by Joshua Reynolds.
