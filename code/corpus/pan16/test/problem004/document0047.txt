“Dreamwork delivers jump-cuts”, David Harsent writes towards the end of Fire Songs, and it’s a phrase that could be taken as a statement of his poetic modus operandi through much of his 11th collection. It delivers a stream of feverish, oneiric visions, of apocalypse brought about through war or environmental catastrophe or the boundless human capacity for self‑deception and bedevilment; and everywhere there’s the lick of flame – “it will be fire” is a recurring line. 
 The collection makes rich use of symbol, especially biblical symbol, and reads somewhat like a modern-day Book of Revelation – there’s definitely something of the entranced, ecstatic visionary in some of the bravura pieces here. And it resounds with judgment, both historical and yet to come. Thematically, it’s organised around four “Fire” pieces, kicking off with the burning, in 1546, of Anne Askew, the Protestant martyr and poet whose chief offence against the church was her effrontery, first, in reading the Bible in English and, second, in seeking divorce from a man her father had decided she would marry in place of her elder sister who had died – in which, of course, she was following the lead of her king, who she appears to have thought would support her case. 
 Instead she ended up in the tower, on the rack, at the hands of Richard Rich – she famously refused to name names – and then at Smithfield. “My dream of her puts me in close-by”, Harsent writes. His rendering of the scene is unsparing, “as her hair / goes up in a rush, as her fingers char, / as the spit on her tongue bubbles and froths, as she browns from heel / to head …” In her case, perhaps, the destructive power of fire is also one of regeneration, a harrowing of the body to purify the spirit: “In the fire lies your salvation, Anne, they said. What greater thing / than the brush of His hand as He stoops to take up your soul?” 
 Here, as in the later “Fire: love songs and descants”, the rather more humdrum event of a bonfire provides the way in to the poem. In this case the speaker is burning “letters, cuttings, poems, diaries, notebooks”. The burning of the written word is a recurrent motif, whether it’s the speaker destroying his own papers, Dorothy Wordsworth “feeding the fire … with reams / of work half-done”, or, most devastatingly, in “Fire: a party at the world’s end”, a holocaust that betokens the end of civilisation and has “whole libraries on an updraught”. In contrast to Askew’s fate, this is no cleansing or refining distillation; rather, it has a hellish for-its-own-sake purity, which is nonetheless impressive and mesmerising, as flames are: 
 These poems have an eye, and a taste, for the macabre. “Sang the Rat” is an extraordinary catalogue of rat lore through the long history of human-rat interaction, from battlefield scavengers, to tales of rat-kings, to bringers of plague. The poem figures them as our shadow-selves, their cunning and species-success matched only by our own. “Rapacious like us prolific like us omnivorous like us prodigal like us unremitting like us like us a killer of its own kind.” The staccato grammar and long lines prove beguiling: “Gourmet of what’s necrotic what suppurates whatever’s gone to the bad graveyard morsels and fancies scraps of what’s soft in rot.” 
 The long narrative poem “A Dream Book” also feasts on putrescence: And here again, a dream-like narrative – albeit one formally arranged, into six-line rhyming stanzas – allows the poet to jump seamlessly between vignettes, in this case covering the life cycle of a relationship from desire and fulfilment to miscommunication and eventual indifference. 
 But it’s not all nightmare, unease and grotesquerie. There’s also a lovely piece about hen harriers, a scattering of soundscape poems entitled “Tinnitus” that glance at Harsent’s musical career (he is a long-term collaborator with Harrison Birtwistle, to whom this volume is dedicated), as well as the extraordinary “Armistice”. This virtuosic piece is made of a single, unpunctuated sentence arranged into couplets that all rhyme on the letter D. It confounds one’s expectations for an “anti-war” poem by starting off in a world of unimpeachable niceness, a “Peaceable Kingdom”, a picture-book democracy of creation where lynx and lamb. 
 The poem disdains simplistic notions about peace and war and has the humility to acknowledge the limits of art. It ends with the striking image of Christ stepping down from the cross.
