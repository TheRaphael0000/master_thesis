What can we learn from the internet’s “bottom half”? How does one distinguish in the first place between content and comment? Is comment a quintessentially modern form, created by and fashioning the internet? Or is it a continuation of the more ancient arts of critique, review, heckle and abuse – as old as language? 
 It is plain to me that the modern comment is quite distinct from communication that came before it, whether a letter in green ink or a glowing, “Dear Points of View, imagine my delight … ”. Comments need to crowd around a source – since the internet began, media new and old have experimented with getting readers to go off and chat on their own: it’s almost never worked. But once they have converged on a source, the presence of the original author is not required, indeed, it can become a bit of a killjoy. 
 In the early days, editors would talk about collapsing barriers and dissolving the old hierarchical relationship between writer and reader. The balance was between a vision of utopian democratisation on the one hand, and, on the other, livid writers who would take a kicking for work that previously would have stood alone to honour their name. “People who would never be seen dead reading the Guardian,” as Private Eye once put it, spent “their days savaging it and being hailed by the paper as the heroes of the new order”. Certainly, it was bruising, and quite unnavigable; I was moderated off my own thread way more often than my deadly enemies were. Yet it was never just trolls writing below the line, and I disagree with the view that anyone who has the time to comment is by definition ignorable. 
 A lot of the arguments within the commenting community in earlier days managed to work their way around the people who simply hated everything, bringing insight, expertise and the depth of multiple perspectives to the conversation. It seemed that the ephemeral nature of the content unleashed a confidence and openness in the commenter that an established text could not. People were liberated by the idea of newspapers being egregious and tomorrow’s chip-paper – they could say what they thought. When contributing to threads, I was often left behind, still defending my original position when the discussion had moved beyond it (now I just stick to Twitter, where people want to comment to you, and have that comment acknowledged). I had no trouble accepting Joseph M Reagle’s proposition in this book: that commenting is a specific form, uniting many different impulses around the same opportunity, and shows us what participation online means. 
 Reagle justifies his project thus: “There is a lot of dreck down there, but in sifting through the comments, we can learn much about ourselves and the ways that other people seek to exploit the value of our social selves.” I assumed this sentence would simply unpack itself, as the book went along: what would we learn about ourselves? What does the “value of our social self” mean, exactly? Are other people exploiting my value, or their own? 
 It isn’t plain and never becomes so. Reagle defines “comment” rather formally – “reactive, short and asynchronous” – meaning that it can be made “within seconds, hours or even days of its provocation”. This observation was so blindingly obvious – all response must come seconds, hours, days, months or years after the event, otherwise it would come before the event, and therefore not be a response – that I hovered on it, expecting one of those miracles of sociology, whereby the reader is led by a series of self-evident principles into a mind-blowing revelation. That didn’t happen, either. 
 The writing is flabby. “In the blogging domain, there is little that Dave Winer has not written code for, started a company around, or opined about.” It can’t be true, can it? Given that blogging covers the entirety of human knowledge and experience, there must be a huge amount that Winer has not written code for, started a company around or opined about. The introduction tells us that Winer, “often credited with first enabling blog comments”, then disabled them in 2012, “seemingly forever”. It wouldn’t have been the work of Hercules to call Winer and ask if it was for ever; the author could even have asked him why. Also in 2012, Amazon users noticed that a huge number of reviews had been removed; Facebook removed 200,000 suspect likes from a single site; Yelp filtered 30m reviews and found 20% of them to be dodgy. “On the one hand, it’s good to hear about services cracking down on fake comments, reviews, likes and views. However, I suspect that this is as much for the benefit of the sites as it is for their users.” Again, why guess, when you could just ask? Especially when discussing the behemoths of the web – Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Yelp – there is a supine, anti-journalistic atmosphere, a lot of “perhaps”s and “possibly”s; these companies, at least notionally concerned about transparency, might be happy to discuss these issues. Even where the author does go and interview at source, he manages to render the conversations so drily that he may as well have culled the quotes from a third party. 
 Behaviour is described but never interrogated. “Unboxing”, for example, features (mainly) men, buying new gadgets and then uploading videos of themselves unwrapping them; in “haul” videos, (mainly) women do the same with clothes. These classic displays of internet weirdness, suggesting the naivety of a toddler preferring the wrapping to the present, are laced with an Adornian fetish. They may not be comments but, in line with his own brief, Reagle could have had a look at the comments these unboxing videos attract. Instead, he concludes, “the historical proliferation of comment accompanied an increase in consumerism … much comment is related to the consumption of goods and services.” Yes, really. When people buy stuff, they like to talk about it. 
 There are cartoons throughout from geek-and-poke.com; some of them will be familiar (“I can’t go to bed, someone is wrong on the internet”). In one, a creature says, “Isn’t it great? We have to pay nothing for the barn”, while a second replies, “Yeah! And even the food is free”. The caption reads: “Pigs talking about the ‘free’ model.” In a proper cartoon, you would be able to tell they were pigs: you might, in the hands of a really skilled artist, have been able to guess what kind of model they were talking about. 
 Most irksome is the historical sweep, in which the Babylonian commentary on the first Sumerian documents are taken as ur-comments and Charles II’s Proclamation for the Suppression of Coffee Houses is presented as a fear of public comment: “Despite the proclamation, caffeinated commentary was not easily quieted.” This stuff is so broad as to be almost meaningless; Charles II was afraid of public assembly, accompanied by stimulants, for the perfectly sound reason that a public gathering had once decapitated his father, even without coffee and sherbet. 
 Arguably, coming together in communitarian protest is the exact opposite of the modern comment, in which you sit alone and hurl insults from afar. There could have been an interesting discussion, on that note, as to whether modern comments foment discontent – political or social – or, rather, neuter it. But the casual generalisation – in which “comment” can mean any people, saying anything to one another, in any medium, context or period – militates against that kind of inquiry. 
 There are certainly good elements – it is useful as a glossary and does a solid job of recapping key online spats (Xeni Jardin v Bachir Boumaaza, Orlando Figes v all the other historians). The central argument, however – that comments, as a genre, can be drawn together to give us a picture of our new selves – turns out not to be true, or is simply not approached with enough rigour.
