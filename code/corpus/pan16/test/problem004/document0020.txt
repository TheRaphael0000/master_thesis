To Dr Johnson, it was Grub Street, where “no man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money”. To Thackeray, it was “the Corporation of the Goosequill”. In the 20th century, Bloomsbury’s Frances Partridge would refer to “the Prose Factory”, the starting point for DJ Taylor’s investigation of a most peculiar “factory”. 
 For instance, while trading conditions and the means of production have changed beyond recognition, the product itself remains remarkably resilient. An 18th-century coachman might be astonished by an inter-city bus, but his passengers would still recognise the 21st-century book. 
 Furthermore, for both creators and consumers, the hard-wired instincts of Grub Street have scarcely changed in 300 years. Despite the threat of laptops and ebooks to a literary ecosystem, readers still sit in chairs to read the words that writers have put down on various kinds of paper. 
 This coexistence of high and low tech is probably the main paradox at the heart of this book. And who better than DJ Taylor to undertake the Sisyphean labour of anatomising such a society in all its quiddities, vanities, rivalries and ambitions? 
 Taylor, dipped in ink from childhood, knows the exigencies of his trade. He is the author of several novels, an Orwell biography and popular studies of 19th- and 20th-century literary life. In short, he’s that rare species, a man of letters. 
 With such creatures apparently on the verge of extinction, there could hardly be a better time for this report, a book that’s as much an elegy for a way of life as an inquiry into “taste”, its declared purpose. 
 Taylor never quite says this but the barbarians are at the gates, and the nerds from IT have taken over the prose factory. During the thirtysomething years of his professional lifetime, the world of books has been threatened by the biggest “paradigm shift”, Kuhn’s famous phrase, since Gutenberg. 
 Eventually, this revolution will doubtless liberate our literary culture with many new opportunities. In the short term, however, the world of books and letters has been turned upside down by the e-revolution and the annihilating gospel of “free content”. 
 Future generations will read Taylor’s portrait of “literary life” with a mixture of puzzlement and gratitude. They will be mystified by the defunct customs of “galleys” and “hot metal”, but thrilled by the lunches and the long weekends. If Taylor sometimes barks up the wrong tree, en passant he diverts the reader with several chapters of high-class literary gossip. 
 More soberly, Taylor’s story falls into three parts: modernism, and the interwar battle between highbrows and lowbrows; the second world war, and the rise of mass culture in the age of Penguin’s Lady Chatterley; and finally the generation that began with Kingsley Amis, boomed with Amis fils and his contemporaries, and ended with Penelope Fitzgerald and the young Zadie Smith, ie the recent past and the near present. 
 Taylor’s narrative is often rich and vivid; his analysis less so. He declares that he wants to investigate “taste” and “literary culture”. From an unseasoned commentator, this would be an advertisement for a wild goose chase. Even in the hands of a professional, it is doubtful if it amounts to more than an encyclopedic display of bookish arcana. 
 At least, in a trackless desert of print, our guide seems sure of his route. Taylor, rarely short of self-belief, makes some sly digs at Professor John Carey and his The Intellectuals and the Masses. But Carey had a real argument, one that he prosecuted to brilliant effect, the hostile response of the English intelligentsia to the new, and apparently threatening, phenomenon of mass culture. 
 One longs here for a similarly rigorous coherence in Taylor’s analysis of Grub Street. If The Prose Factory has an argument underneath its research, it is that the republic of letters has gone to the dogs. 
 Few could dispute that the exalted arbiters of literary taste such as TS Eliot, FR Leavis or Cyril Connolly, have been replaced by a chaotic cacophony of amateur opinion in which there is no consensus, a lot of heat and not much illumination. 
 Is this is to the detriment of culture as a whole? A sub-theme of The Prose Factory is the vitality of British philistinism. Shiva Naipaul, after a reading on Humberside, received just one question: “Do you live in a mud hut?” 
 Nonetheless, Taylor has several middle-aged regrets about the decline of literary argument, and “the absence of any real aesthetic divide”, which decline into a querulous grumble about the loss of shared criteria. What, he asks, do we mean when we talk about taste, in an age where everyone is a tastemaker? 
 It’s a fair question for the threnodist of a literary culture challenged by the belligerent and anonymous boors of the blogosphere, but it amounts to something perilously close to a statement of the bleeding obvious. 
 A weak line of argument becomes even more vulnerable when we recognise how provincial are Taylor’s analytical limitations. Grub Street has now gone global, but even in the 20th century it was always a transatlantic affair, something Taylor never fully addresses. 
 The “prose factory” was an Anglo-American production line that, from Melville’s Moby-Dick (first published in Britain) to Harper Lee ’s To Kill a Mockingbird (a staple of the UK school syllabus), connected, and still connects, London and New York through language and culture. Who could dispute that the great postwar tastemakers include American writers such as Bellow, Trilling and Updike? 
 A further difficulty for any writer, nose pressed against the tempting window of contemporary culture, is: how to achieve perspective? Taylor gets so immersed in the minutiae of his subject that he undersells the big climax. 
 The pre-millennial years 1975-2005 do not fit into any previous pattern, they mark both a decisive break with the past, and also an aberration sponsored by Thatcherism, loadsamoney and the abolition of the Net Book Agreement in 1997, a watershed that Taylor barely addresses. 
 Ironically, it has been the unholy alliance of Google and Amazon that rewards a privileged few while renewing the old ways for the majority. In Grub Street Redux many writers now earn less than a well-organised dog-walker. That’s another paradox Taylor neglects: while many writers are struggling, it has become a golden age of reading. 
 Despite these caveats, Taylor deserves credit for seeking a stillness in the eye of the storm to collect his thoughts and describe a century of literary achievement before it becomes at one with Nineveh and Tyre.
