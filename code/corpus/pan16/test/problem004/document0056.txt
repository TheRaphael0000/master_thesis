Polly Samson’s second novel opens with a young woman on a windswept hillside. Julia is meeting her lover. On one hand, she wears a leather gauntlet; the hawk on her fist belongs to her brutish husband. As her lover kisses her, the bird flies, soaring into the air. It does not heed her as she tries to call it back. When it swoops in for the kill, the scream of the rabbit seems to go on for ever. 
 The story that follows this unsettling introduction is a slow unravelling, told first from the perspective of her lover, Julian, and then, later, from Julia’s. It is set in a present tense some eight years after that evening hawking on the hill, when Julian is living in his childhood home, alone and mired in grief. It is a sultry, airless summer. What has become of Julia and their daughter, Mira, is unclear, but their absence echoes through the house. Even the photograph of Mira with a crown of daisies in her hair has gone from its place beside the bed. 
 Julian, a writer of children’s books, cannot work – can barely rouse himself to wash or eat. Instead he slumps, sunk in memories, rehearsing the euphoric early days of his love affair with Julia, nearly a decade his senior, which began when he was an undergraduate. Then followed the relinquishing of his English degree and a promising career in academia, the struggles and joys of slowly building a life together. Interspersed with the painful nostalgia of his recollections, however, are the more recent horrors of Mira’s critical illness, the months spent sleeplessly at Great Ormond Street hospital, the agonies of drips and chemotherapy and ICU, the desperate soul-shrivelling terror that the illness might win, that she might not find the strength to pull through. 
 Samson is a skilful storyteller. In The Kindness she has constructed a tantalisingly labyrinthine tale full of hints and feints, an intricate weave of tangled knots and dropped stitches from which, very slowly, the truth of the past begins to emerge. She plays cleverly with the timeline of the narrative, the vagueness of memory creating a slippery, uncertain chronology that obscures and occasionally confuses but never deliberately conceals. Samson is too scrupulous a plotter to cheat. 
 It is disappointing, then, that the characters never quite convince. Samson is aware of the significance of names: early in the novel, Julian remembers that they named their child Mira Eliana for the miracle of her birth, “from the Latin mirus ”, surprising, and the Hebrew word for God-given. In naming her protagonists Julian and Julia, Samson intimates a fundamental connection between the lovers, a bond so close that it is almost a merging of selves, but on the page the relationship fails to ignite. 
 In part this is a difficulty intrinsic to a plot realised in reverse amid the debris of a failed relationship, but the greater problem is one of underdevelopment. Julian is a child-man: devoted to his high-handed mother, he is determined not only to install his new family at Firdaws, the idyllic country cottage where he grew up, but to recreate for them there the precise topography of his own childhood, ripping out the modern fittings installed by the previous owners and replacing every last detail, right down to the curtains and his mother’s dog-chewed carpets. Perhaps Samson finds this endearing. There are moments in the novel when even the narrative voice adopts an incongruously fey tone: ivy “flicks V-signs”, while one character, needing to urinate, jigs from foot to foot in what Samson coyly calls a “pee-pee dance”. Certainly, Julian’s Peter Pan fixation with Firdaws is as key to the plot as his willingness to cede to his mother the most important decisions of his life, but, insufficiently excavated, his passivity only serves to irritate. In the absence of other redeeming qualities, or even of self-knowledge, one cannot help but wonder why Julia ever fell for him at all. 
 The beautiful Julia, meanwhile, remains a chilly, rather distant figure who never quite comes into focus, driven less by love and conflicted loyalty than a kind of irritable dissatisfaction with her lot. As a result, the emotional power of the novel is diminished; the delicious madness of first love, the clenched desperation of fear and the deadening agony of grief are delineated and described but never fully felt. One is left with the sense that Julian and Julia are two lovers following not the flawed and contradictory impulses of their own hearts but the complicated dance steps of a clever but ultimately preordained plot.
