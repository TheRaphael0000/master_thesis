Dolphins are sexy beasts. I was once caught up in a superpod of 200 dusky dolphins off the coast of New Zealand. The sleek cetacean torpedos were zipping all around, and at one moment I turned to face two dozen of them charging directly at me. I thought I was about to be run down. But these animals can detect an object the thinness of a human fingernail at 20 yards. Effortlessly, they turned and swooped between my legs and under my arms. 
 Only later, as I climbed, exhausted, out of the water, was I told by the naturalist on board that in fact my playmates were continually having sex around me. Dolphins can mate three times in five minutes – not only with their own, but with other dolphin species. They’ll even mount sharks and turtles in their search to satisfy their endless libido. Surely only an animal with a lot of quality time on their flippers – being extremely efficient predators, highly social and intelligent – could have evolved such a lifestyle? And as such, shouldn’t they be the cynosure of our oceans, glorious role models for us, their land-bound cousins? Well, yes, and no. 
 Voices in the Ocean, written by Susan Casey, editor of Oprah Winfrey’s O Magazine, seems to be pitching for a TV series with its show-stopping opening scene of the author swimming with spinner dolphins off Hawaii. Entranced by these acrobats, which spin in the air like cotton bodkins, Casey feels she has stumbled on “some ancient tribe” whose language she did not understand but who seem to be communicating with her. Subsequently, she joins the wonderfully named Joan Ocean and her dolphin cult on interactive courses entitled “Dolphins, Teleportation and Time Travel”. But what starts out as a feelgood, new-agey account darkens like the sunlight diminishing in the deep, subtly turning into a devastating chronicle of one of the most egregious mismatches in natural-human history. The result is a brilliantly written and passionate book. 
 The sorry tale of cetaceans in captivity begins with PT Barnum and his New York belugas, most of which died days after capture or, if they survived long enough, succumbed in fires in his Broadway emporia, boiled alive. The story resumes in Florida in the 1930s with the precursors of the modern-day oceanaria, but it wasn’t until the appearance of Flipper in his eponymous 1963 movie and later TV series that dolphin mania really took off. Even the New York Times was impressed: “The dolphin does amazing things. It registers pathos and joy in its own way, and manages to upstage anything less than 8ft long.” 
 Part of the appeal was, and is, that perceived relationship between ourselves and these animals. The dolphin, so human-like in its physical scale and spirit, resembles a streamlined, happier version of ourselves, forever smiling. It’s why we like to believe in stories of dolphins “saving” people at sea. When surfer Todd Endris was bitten by a great white off Monterey, dolphins drove the shark away, formed a ring around Endris and escorted him back to the beach. Even Dick Van Dyke told how falling asleep on his surfboard, and drifting out of sight of land, he was pushed back to safety by dolphins (presumably real rather than Disney cartoons). But Casey points out that there is an instinctive reason for these “rescues”. Dolphin social structure means that if they see a single human, they automatically think it needs to be returned to its pod. 
 In a mind-expanding meeting with Lori Merino, a neuroscientist, Casey explores that sociality. Merino explains that the dolphin brain has a complexity exceeding our own brains, with an incredible processing ability that powers their lightning-quick responses. Dolphins not only recognise themselves in the mirror, indicating an abstract sense of self, but also on film, in the way that only humans and higher primates can. Uniquely, their brains also have an extra lobe which relates to emotion; some scientists believe dolphins may be more emotionally mature than humans, observing moral codes as a result of living so close together. Exhibiting communal individuality, they exist as if their peers’ bodies, and brains, were extensions of their own. 
 It is the implications of the notion that “the dolphin in the tank is not a what but a who” that renders their captivity unbearable, for us as well as them. As she investigates marine parks, Casey realises that neither visitors nor staff are able to put the animals into context. “The entire industry is built on the illusion that dolphins had somehow dropped from the sky.” When Casey asks an employee, “Where did these dolphins come from?”, she receives no sensible reply. Either they don’t know, or they don’t want to. At Connyland, a Swiss dolphinarium – the exquisite irony of a landlocked state hosting such a facility is eloquent enough – the inmates are subjected to incessant noise and flashing lights in what one scientist calls “a perversion of the highest degree”. 
 Other captive dolphins beat themselves up – gnawing on cement enclosures, banging their heads against walls, eating stray bits of plastic litter purely out of mind-numbing boredom. Many are regularly dosed with Valium. 
 Yet more disturbing are Casey’s reports from Taiji, in Japan, and the Solomon Islands, the source of many of these captives. In Japan, the culls continue apace: 20,000 animals a year are driven into narrow rocky inlets and slaughtered. The majority are destined to be eaten – despite the fact that their flesh contains so much mercury (up to 5,000 times the recommended safety limit) that human ingestion can result in memory loss, nerve tremors “and a hellish syndrome called desquamation, which is basically your skin peeling off”. 
 Perhaps the butchered animals are the lucky ones. A dead dolphin is worth $500; a live one can be sold for $150,000, if it can be trained – 10% of the Taiji cull ends up in oceanaria in Asia, Russia and Ukraine, bought by dealers “untroubled by the process of plucking that dolphin out of a pool of blood that contains the dead bodies of its entire family”. That violence seems transferable. Joining the protesters in Taiji – both westerners and Japanese – Casey is confronted by demure kimono-clad women who shout in her face, “Why don’t you die instead of dolphins?” In the Solomon Islands, where questioning their dolphin slaughter can result in actual bodily harm, she gets into even deeper water. 
 The cultural intransigence – and human greed – of this story defies logical reasoning. Perhaps that’s the point. We forever anthropomorphise, investing animals with our sins, imposing our stories on theirs. Some of us want to eat dolphins, some of us want to swim with them. What dolphins themselves might want is not part of the equation. Given our inability to live with our own kind, you might not hold out a lot of hope for the way we continue to treat other species. But with Sea World’s stock falling fast in the wake of Gabriela Cowperthwaite’s documentary Blackfish, Voices in the Ocean comes as a timely and urgent call for the last act of the dolphin circus.
