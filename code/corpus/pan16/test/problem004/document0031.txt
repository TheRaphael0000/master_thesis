If the work of Adam Thirlwell were ever put on trial, the prosecution would confidently cite some eye-poppingly hostile reviews of his novels Politics and The Escape and the “inside-out novel” Miss Herbert– alleging pretentiousness, impenetrability and tonal arrogance – before the jury was hung by a defence list of literary character witnesses that includes Milan Kundera, Tom Stoppard, AS Byatt and Dave Eggers. 
 The divisiveness of Thirlwell’s writing can partly be attributed to the enmity often suffered by heavily publicised prodigies: he was included in a Granta list of the best British novelists under 40 when 16 years below the cut-off age, despite not having published a novel at the time. He may also have received ricochets from critical fire aimed at his mentor Craig Raine, editor of Aret&eacute; magazine, with whom he shares a fascination with the erotic-philosophical novels of Kundera. Books such as The Unbearable Lightness of Being have influenced both of them to stretch their sentences and characters’ genitals in unlikely directions. 
 Thirlwell’s third novel Lurid & Cute again nods to Kundera, in both hectic levels of sex and a carefully placed use of the word “lightness” to describe the ideal relationship. However, in this book, another modernist explorer of sex and ideas, the Japanese writer Haruki Murakami, seems to have served as a prose coach as well. Less expectedly, it has the format of a crime or mystery story, what the narrator calls a “little murder ballad”. Indeed, the novel reads like a collaboration between Kundera and Murakami to adapt SJ Watson ’s Before I Go to Sleep or Gillian Flynn ’s Gone Girl into post-modernist fiction. 
 Thirlwell’s “kind of 30” narrator wakes up in a hotel room to find his mistress, Romy, comatose and bleeding from the eyes after a night of sex and drugs, which will be difficult to explain to his wife, Candy. As they live with his parents, the difficult conversations multiply. 
 But though readers soon know where they are with the basic plot, precise geographical location is discouraged. The two-timing “I” occasionally mentions a familiar place such as “Miami” or “Manhattan”, but he lives in a generalised metropolis that seems to have been Photoshopped from details of many places: it has docks and trams but also a “Presidential freeway” and a “cricket stadium”. Mate, the South American beverage, seems to be on tap but earnings are referred to as “roubles and rupees”, which suggests an attempt to create a fictional Every City in which a fable about human behaviour – the storyteller frequently describes himself as a “utopian” and a “libertine” – can be played out without such locally limiting details as who’s in government and what’s on television. 
 Timeless, stateless fiction, however, tends to struggle with the dialogue. All cultures have distinct habits of language, but, because the speech of Thirlwell’s people is designed to avoid any single tongue sticking out, they converse in odd-sounding endearments (“my fuzzy bear … my kook …petrushka”), strange slang (“pizzatweet”) and broken English: “I no follow.” At one point, it appears that the organising voice is not addressing us in his native language – “I am finding often a problem of verb forms” – although his rough English is also curiously up to such poetic observations as “the soft tearing sound the bubbles of washing-up foam make in the sink”. 
 Equally erratic is the form of the story. More conventional novels that start with spouses in danger generally go on to involve the death or disappearance of a partner, but the central investigation in Lurid & Cute, despite thriller-like references to “my life before and after” and “losing everything”, is philosophical: a consideration of the dynamics of lying, and the moral and physical plausibility of exclusive sexual relationships. In the frank tradition of Kundera, Murakami and Raine, these issues are tested in a lengthy orgy scene that is immediately followed by a detailed sauna sequence. 
 The style and structure of Lurid & Cute seem unlikely to persuade Thirlwell’s detractors to retract. When the narrator’s mother scolds him, “Let’s not try to analyse everything to death, shall we, just this once?”, and gets the response, “But what else can I do?”, readers may detect an authorial confession. 
 For a reader agnostic about this novelist, the book induced alternating annoyance and admiration. Disastrous formulations – “Fate was off buying itself a burger or apricot juice” or “where the real is more like sherbet” – share the pages with numerous moments where the everyday is rendered fresh, such as the description of the vehicles in a movie car chase “ballooning and bursting security fences, upending squad cars”. Lurid & Cute is never a car-crash but confirms this clearly talented and original writer’s tendency to drive even potential believers to despair.
