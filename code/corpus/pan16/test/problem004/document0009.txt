Hunting and adultery among the inhabitants of the Belgian Ardennes probably aren’t what you’d expect from a Colombian writer best known for a novel about the violence of the Medell&iacute;n drug cartel (the Impac-prizewinning Sound of Things Falling ). But all seven of the stories in Juan Gabriel V&aacute;squez ’s elegant new collection are about just that – hounds, horses, the discreet pangs of the Belgian rural bourgeoisie. An author’s note reveals that V&aacute;squez wrote the stories after spending a year in Belgium in 1999, which presumably accounts for the setting, though it doesn’t diminish the faint aura of determined capriciousness about the whole enterprise. Even in this age of globalised fiction it’s unusual to see a writer cultivate a territory as small and specific as this, and seemingly so remote from his own. 
 The same author’s note also reveals that V&aacute;squez was partly inspired by a comment of Tobias Wolff ’s, that “a book of stories should be like a novel in which the characters don’t know each other”, which perhaps explains the many quasi-repetitions that occur throughout, as if the intent was to create a kind of thematic echo chamber in which the same handful of basic motifs recur, continually mirroring and reframing each other. An unanswered telephone, image of a refusal of intimacy in one story, reappears more brutally (its cord ripped out of the wall) as an image of a man’s inability to deal with his wife’s treacherous past. A wounded pheasant whose imagined suffering drives a wedge between the couple in the title story both is, and is not, the same pheasant being plucked and gutted by the wife in the next story along, as she tells her husband she had been planning to leave him. The pompous master of the boar hunt in that same story, whose life is upended by his lovelorn father’s suicide, merges into another self-important huntsman, cuckolded (and worse) in “The Solitude of the Magician”. The shooting of a dog early on in the book performs much the same structural function as the gelding of a horse near the end. And so on. The effect is to give the collection an overall feeling of rigorous, even rather obsessive, unity and coherence. It’s as if we keep approaching the same primal scene with different actors and from slightly different angles. 
 In themselves, the tales pursue an aesthetic that, despite a certain indebtedness to Hemingway ’s hunting stories, is about as far as you can imagine from the neo-Hemingway/Carveresque minimalism that was fashionable in anglophone literature at the time V&aacute;squez was writing them. These are extended dramas rather than the fleeting moments short stories more commonly favour. They use intricately worked-out plots and metaphors to reach for complex statements about love and loss. The gelding of that horse, for instance, is at once literal – occasioning a scene of painfully graphic clarity – and metaphorical, leaching its disturbing atmosphere into our understanding of the woman who performs it, and supplying us with the emotional knowledge necessary to make sense of her final act of destruction. They move in on their quarry with unexpected twists and turns, many of which contrive to fold vast tracts of life into the confines of the narrative (as in his full-length fiction, V&aacute;squez is fond of time-compressing devices such as prison sentences or decades-old emotional scars). 
 It can take a while to find your feet – to separate the crucial from the incidental, and figure out exactly what you’re being asked to follow. In less assured hands this could be a problem, and there were certainly moments when I felt thrown too far off course by big events that turned out to be relatively inconsequential. The death of a child, for instance – always something that exerts a strong gravitational pull on a reader – seems almost glibly peripheral in “Hiding Places”. And sometimes the sheer quantity of incidents arouses a certain resistance. The stuttering emotions between the couple in the title story, who don’t know from one minute to the next if their marriage is going to survive, are dramatic enough to occupy a whole story in themselves. But halfway through, V&aacute;squez sends the husband on a detour with another woman who has such a large drama of her own (test-pilot husband, terrible accident, mysterious photographs) that by the time we come back to the original relationship, our readerly allegiances have been thoroughly bifurcated by the competing plotlines. That may be the point – vacillation being very much the theme of the tale – but you have to wonder whether the material might have been better suited to a novel than a short story. 
 Still, even when there do seem to be a few too many moving parts, the parts themselves are always skilfully rendered. V&aacute;squez writes a vigorous, lucid prose (well translated by Anne McLean), full of bright physical particularities and confident psychological touches. My favourite piece was “The Lodger” (the one with the ripped out telephone). Its 40 pages of looping narrative draw events from several decades in the lives of a group of old friends and hunting companions into a two-day drama where a lethal combination of shotguns, ancient betrayals and freshly opened wounds releases a series of emotional shocks and discoveries, as a woman who long ago rejected her lover in favour of her husband suddenly has to reckon with the lover’s death. Beyond the simple pleasure of a well-wrought tragedy, it offers a sustained meditation on the lingering power of the unlived life – the road not taken – over the life we actually live. It’s a powerful story, told with a calm conviction that suggests the book’s slightly unlikely coupling of author and subject might actually be an entirely natural match.
