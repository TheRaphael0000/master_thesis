A “colossal fragmentation of reality” occurred in the 20th century, Salman Rushdie has said, and his novels enact and display that fragmentation with terror and glee. His new book assures us that reality has lately been crumbling more colossally than ever, and is about to come completely unglued. The climate destabilisation we are experiencing is only a foretaste of advancing chaos, which the author describes with considerable relish. Eschatological lightning strikes, oracular infants and local failures of gravity will become the norm, as the Dark Ifrits, the mischievous forces of disorder, begin to take advantage of the weakening of the fabric of the everyday. 
 The cumbrous title transcribes a certain number of days into years and months, but not the four weeks that would naturally complete it, because the word “Nights” is needed to suggest the original Thousand and One. Rushdie is our Scheherazade, inexhaustibly enfolding story within story and unfolding tale after tale with such irrepressible delight that it comes as a shock to remember that, like her, he has lived the life of a storyteller in immediate peril. Scheherazade told her 1,001 tales to put off a stupid, cruel threat of death; Rushdie found himself under similar threat for telling an unwelcome tale. So far, like her, he has succeeded in escaping. May he continue to do so. 
 At the idea of trying to summarise the plot, I shriek and fall back fainting on my seraglio couch. Rushdie has a fractal imagination: plot buds from plot, endlessly. There are at least 1,001 stories and substories, and nearly as many characters. All you need to know is that they’re mostly highly entertaining, amusing and ingenious. A good many of the characters are in fact genies. The jinn live in their own world, Peristan. But the dilapidation of reality in our world, intensifying since the second millennium, has affected the wall between us and Peristan, leaving slots and slits through which they can slip. 
 Their existence in Peristan is one of almost ceaseless sexual intercourse in surroundings of total luxury. Still, some of them find this as boring as some of us might, and like to sneak over here to entertain themselves by meddling with our little mortal lives. The male jinn are creatures of flame, the female jinnia of smoke. They have great powers of magic, not so great powers of intellect. Wilful, impulsive and unwise, one of them gets trapped over here every now and then, imprisoned by a spell in a bottle or a lamp. 
 We haven’t seen any jinn for a while because their passages into our world were sealed up about a thousand years ago, not long after the greatest jinnia princess, Dunia, had a love affair in Andalucia with the philosopher Ibn Rushd (also known as the great Aristotelian philosopher Averroes). The outcome of this affair was a slew of descendants distinguished by their lobeless ears and trace of fairy blood. For that’s what Peristan is in English – Fairyland. 
 The main plot – the outermost Chinese box – is constructed around a philosophical feud between the rationalist Ibn Rushd and the pious theologian Ghazali of Iran (known and honoured as Renewer of the Faith and Proof of Islam), who placed the power of God above all earthly causes and effects. Ibn Rushd tried to reconcile reason and humane morality with God and faith, positing a kindly God and an unfanatic faith. He challenged Ghazali. His reward was disgrace and exile. 
 I met Rushdie many years ago, long before the fatwa, but I can’t remember if he has lobes to his ears. In any case, certain parallels are clear. This book is a fantasy, a fairytale – and a brilliant reflection of and serious meditation on the choices and agonies of our life in this world. 
 The choices are presented simplistically, comic-book style, as absolute Good and Evil. The agonies are presented, disaster-movie style, as catastrophes so awful that readers who don’t want to think about them can shrug them off. Rushdie is a generous, good-natured writer who’d rather woo and seduce his readers than reduce the truth to gall and brimstone and make them swallow it. All the same, the frontispiece of the book is the Goya engraving that stands at the very entrance of the modern age: The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. The monsters here engendered, however playfully imagined, are not imaginary. 
 The strongest male figure among the many in this book is Mr Geronimo, a gardener. He is a physically and emotionally vivid character, likable for his strength and modesty and his homesickness for the city of his childhood, Bombay (which to him will never be Mumbai ). There are strong women in the book, too – a Mayor, a Lady Philosopher – but they are pretty much cartoons. The novel’s protagonist, Dunia, is female, and I wish I didn’t have a problem with her. It’s not that she isn’t human; you can’t ask a fairy princess to be anything other than what she is. But you can ask her not to think like a man. 
 Bearing children by the litter, seven to 19 at a time, is certainly a practical-engineering approach to leaving a large number of offspring, but not one many women would choose. We don’t see Dunia nursing her babies (it would be interesting to know how she did it), nor anything of her certainly busy motherhood. When she returns to Earth after a thousand years, it is to defend “her children” – but this means her remote descendants, a scattered group of earlobeless people whom she calls the Duniyat, asserting her authorship of a lineage. 
 The usual name for this authorship is “paternity”, and its importance to men among the Mediterranean and Arabic peoples is very great. More generally, while women are likely to value their actual children and their status as mother over any abstract idea of lineage, men may consider their children, particularly sons, most valuable as maintaining the paternal bloodline. This gender difference may reflect biological imperatives, male mammals being motivated to reproduce their genes, females to nurture the gene-bearers. Dunia is a mammal all right, but her loving heart and her numerous litters can’t keep me from suspecting that – like so many other kick-ass, weapon-wielding warrior women – she’s a man in drag. 
 Towards the end of the book, we find that our descendants of the next millennium have abandoned conflict as a way of life. They peacefully cultivate their gardens rather than their bigotries and hatreds, having found that “in the end, rage, no matter how profoundly justified, destroys the enraged”. But … Of course there has to be a but. 
 Contemporary sophistication declares that peace is boring, moderation is blah, happy is sappy. Defying sophistry, Rushdie imagines a contented people, but only by depriving them of dreams. No visions, no nightmares. Their sleep is empty darkness. The implication is that our human gift of imagining can’t exist without the hatred, anger and aggressiveness that lead to such human behaviours as warfare, conscious cruelty and deliberate destruction. To imply that only our dark jinn inside can give us dreams and visions may be one way of admitting the essential balance between the creative and the destructive within us. 
 But it’s also, I think, a capitulation to the idea, so powerful in 20th-century literature, that the slow processes of creation are less interesting, less real, than the cataclysmic dramas of destruction. And this leaves us right back where we are now. If cultivating our garden stultifies our minds, if using reason prevents our seeing visions, if compassion enfeebles us – what then? Back to conflict as our default solution? Cultivate hatred, anger, violence, reinstate the priests, politicians and warmakers, and finish destroying the Earth? 
 I wish we could abandon this false opposition, which neglects the possibility of more imaginative uses of both the light and the darkness in us. But I like to think how many readers are going to admire the courage of this book, revel in its fierce colours, its boisterousness, humour and tremendous pizzazz, and take delight in its generosity of spirit.
