It’s a long, scorching day in June at the Kaan family farm in the Netherlands, and everyone’s here. The matriarch and patriarch, Anna and Zeeger; their three middle-aged sons, Klaas, Jan and Johan; Klaas’s wife and their five-year-old daughter, Dieke. Only one important person is missing. Anna and Zeeger’s youngest child, a girl called Hanne, died in an accident when still just a toddler, on the day the old queen came to town. That was nearly 40 years ago: 17 June 1969. 
 Today, Zeeger Kaan tends slowly to the property, grumbling at his dog. Jan, newly unemployed, has come from Texel to tidy his little sister’s grave, with fresh white-paint lettering and sky-blue gravel. Klaas considers selling the farm. Johan is the most forthright now; as a boy he used to hide under the pedestal for the family’s Miele top-loading washing-machine whenever things overwhelmed him, but he’s been different since an accident of his own, and today he speaks without inhibition of things that no one else will, about what he thinks, and what he remembers. Anna Kaan, meanwhile, has given up, as she sometimes does – “I’m never celebrating anything again. Ever!” – and retreated to the hayloft, where she has been lying on top of the straw with a bottle of advocaat and a ceremonial sword for days now, refusing all entreaties to come down. In the background a bull called Dirk clanks restlessly against the bars of his enclosure. The men take Dieke fishing. Everyone goes home. 
 June is the third Gerbrand Bakker book to reach English. Its two very fine predecessors – The Twin won the Impac award and The Detour took the Independent foreign fiction prize; both, like this one, were translated by the peerless David Colmer – were narratively uncomplicated. June, however, is fractured, a jumble of perspectives that jostle into the light for a few pages and then recede again to allow another voice to take up the story. If one had to choose a central character among the many who recur, it might be Jan, if only because he’s the outsider who arrives at the beginning, and leaves at the end, but even this is misleading: he holds the spotlight only very occasionally. 
 Each fragment of the day is seen from the perspective of one of the family members; or of the village baker, Blom whose van it was that knocked Hanne over all those years ago; or the cemetery caretaker; or a district nurse on a delayed train. The effect is delicate, intricate. (And for the non-Kaans it gives each character a valuable sense of a life beyond their minor role in someone else’s family story.) The novel slips elegantly between the then and the now. There’s a total lack of anything resembling pace, but that seems not to matter. What holds the reader isn’t a developing, forward-moving plot; the book is more like a still picture becoming visible as parts are revealed, little corners sharpened into focus. It happens slowly, and rather beautifully. The characters that inhabit this picture are subtle and interesting, drawn with quiet sympathy, with depth and detail. 
 And Bakker is a writer who so loves detail. (That Miele top-loader, that blue gravel.) The texture of the queen’s leather-gloved finger on a young girl’s cheek somehow matters more than any moment of real narrative. It’s in these details that we see the novelist most in control. Zeeger planning to cut down a tree; Klaas counting out the wriggling fish in the bucket and talking about nothing much. The splash of red in Johan’s funeral drawings, the green of the bedroom curtains, the yellow of a boy’s swimming trunks. 
 June begins and ends alongside the 60-year-old queen herself, in 1969, on her tour of the area, the day Hanne died – “the day itself”, Bakker calls it. The visit and the death will become what the Kaans’ lives are all about, but however much we learn as the book develops, however much more our picture is filled out, there is no easy meaning in it, no reassuringly tidy explanation – things happen and have consequences, time passes, lives are just what they are; that’s all there is to it. There is no drama any more, only reflectiveness – yes, there are events, but they are mostly trivial; there are old family resentments, but they’re pretty small ones; the pain, even of a great loss, is partly muted now. Bakker is unafraid of stillness, and a master of emotional restraint, and on the small, quiet canvas of June, both of these are very much in evidence.
