In 1925, a 15-year-old girl named Jean Lucey Pratt, who lived with her widowed father in Wembley, began a journal. “I mean to go on writing this for years and years,” she wrote – and unlike most who embark on such an endeavour, she did. By the time she died in 1986, she had filled 45 exercise books, and 400 other loose pages. In combination, they cover what remained of her schooldays; her time studying first architecture, then journalism, in London; the war, during which she held down a boring job in the publicity department of a metals company; and, finally, the hardscrabble years she spent running a tiny bookshop in Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire. 
 More importantly, they also recount, in detail, her emotional life: her friendships, her love affairs and, above all, her failure to marry. And it’s this that sets them apart. Here is a dispatch from a particular and painful frontline: a true, no-holds-barred account of what it felt like to be a clever, independent-minded but otherwise rather ordinary single woman in the middle of the last century. If spinsters were then as thick on the ground as career opportunities for women were thin, they were also silent, their inner voices heard rarely, if at all. Jean Pratt’s diaries have, to my knowledge, no equivalent, for which reason I do not think their value to us can be overstated. 
 But their interest extends beyond the historical. As her tireless and devoted editor, Simon Garfield, notes, her narrative demonstrates “the pure thrill of reading something so fresh that it appears still blottable”. It’s not only that she is a good writer: observant, funny and rather lyrical. Nor is it that she is so honest, though her tendency to look humiliation squarely in the eye fairly pierces the heart. Rather, it’s that her journals, unfettered and intimate, offer up a whole life: an accretion of hopes raised and sometimes sorely dashed, of relationships that shift and stutter and deepen over time. They come with no hindsight. In the moment, Jean does not know if the Germans will invade, her married lover will telephone, her period will (fingers crossed) arrive. She doesn’t even know for how much longer she will have to survive – oh, what miserable suppers this working girl endures – on cheese fried in margarine followed by stale scones soaked in prune juice. And so we live beside her, as absorbed in her story as in any artfully constructed novel. 
 Garfield discovered her in 2002, at the archive of Mass Observation, the social research project that started in 1937, at the University of Sussex; she kept a diary under its auspices during the years of war and subsequent austerity, one he regarded as special enough to be included both in Our Hidden Lives, his bestselling compilation of MO writers, and the two volumes that followed it (she was known then as Maggie Joy Blunt, her identity protected in accord with the liberating agreement MO originally made with its diarists). But was there more? Miraculously, it seemed so. In the attic of Jean’s niece, Babs, were her other diaries, treasure that eventually arrived at Garfield’s house smelling faintly of tobacco, “redolent of pressed flowers and meat paste”. So he set to work, editing them down, fathoming the identities of her extensive cast. The result is A Notable Woman. Though it runs to more than 700 pages, it contains only one sixth of what she wrote. 
 Garfield calls the journals “romantic”, and it’s not hard to see why. Their engine is their author’s tender heart, a muscle that aches with longing, whether for her desire to be a writer (eventually she will publish a biography of an obscure actress) or to bag the right man (at 16, she is already describing the kind she hopes to marry, “witty and popular… reasonable and sympathetic”). But the word romantic implies a certain kind of delusion, and Jean is clear-eyed. Plucky and stoical, determined to remain chipper, she knows exactly what she is, good and bad, and thus what her “deficiencies” are likely to bring her in the future. Her most frequent refrain – “I am lonely” – rubs up against something she understands far less: her powerful longing for independence, even for isolation. By 1939, she has unaccountably moved out of London, and into a cottage in the middle of Burnham Beeches. She likes being alone: “I can work in the evenings instead of having to be agreeable by the fire.” But she fears growing set in her ways, too. Visiting the maiden aunts of her stepmother, Ethel, in 1931, she resolves: “I must go my way. I can never go theirs.” 
 She has lots of love affairs; there’s always someone she’s sweet on. Gus, Hugh, Mac: they come and go faster than the Green Line bus she takes to work. But she does not lose her virginity until she is 31, and then to the unspectacular Francis, a man (“a plant in decay”) she doesn’t even like. It’s pitiful how little she knows of sex and contraception, the details of which she procures from her toxic pal, Nockie. More than once she convinces herself she is pregnant, even before she has slept with the man in question. But there is such valour here too. Why shouldn’t she enjoy sex? In 1946, she writes: “I have never felt any guilt about my ‘experiments’ and I shall go on experimenting if I feel like it.” Aware of her status as one of the Surplus Women who owe their plight to the gender imbalance that followed the first world war, she won’t lay the blame for her spinsterhood on numbers alone. Relations between the sexes, post-1945, are in “deep trouble”. Power is going to have to be recalibrated, at the cost of easy and enduring matches. Women want new things, an active sex life among them. 
 She tries to look outward. It’s what makes her so lovable – this, and the delight she takes in the simple things: a new coat, a punnet of raspberries. But as the years tick by, there comes a turning away. It feels inevitable, out of her control. “I think a woman’s loneliness sometimes outlines her like an aura,” she writes, after an uneasy encounter in the British Museum. Her world shrinks. She has too many cats. The people she loves begin to die. She is hard up. She can still be funny – “I don’t think I’m wildly interested in the vigorous working-class life of Nottingham,” she writes, struggling with Alan Sillitoe – but she knows her path is set. 
 Is this sad? I found it terribly so. But even as I sniffled and sobbed, I felt furious with myself. Sentiment only snubs her achievement. How may a woman be herself? What is she to do with her ambition? Is loneliness the inevitable price of her freedom? These are the questions Jean Pratt’s wondrous journal asks, and we can only hope that anyone who ever bought a copy of Bridget Jones’s Diary will now rush to get hers, too – for this is how it’s done, girls. Show me the woman who hasn’t sometimes felt as Jean did, and I’ll show you a man.
