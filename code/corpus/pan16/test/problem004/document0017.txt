It is a truth generally acknowledged that a man who marries a woman 12 years older than himself must be after her money. Or else he has a mother fixation. Both have been said of Benjamin Disraeli, who married the 47-year-old Mary Anne Lewis at the age of 35. He was a novelist and a dandy with political ambitions; she was a showy widow of means. After their first meeting on April Fools’ Day 1832, he described her as “A pretty little woman, a flirt and a rattle … gifted with a volubility I should think unequalled.” She greatly admired his novel Vivian Grey. 
 It would be pleasing if Daisy Hay’s investigations had uncovered a tale of true love in the face of convention, but they haven’t. What she has found instead is a more complicated and ultimately touching story, which she tells with an exhilarating combination of pace and erudition. Her starting point is simple; that if the Disraelis’ 33-year marriage has puzzled historians, it is because they have overlooked Mary Anne’s side of the story. Her papers have been quarried mostly for their relevance to her husband. 
 From this simple premise ensued a Herculean trawl of 10,000 documents, for Mary Anne was a formidable archivist. After her death, Disraeli was astonished to discover she had kept every letter and note he sent her, as well as quantities of other material. “Nothing,” he wrote, “seems to have escaped her.” Behind the fancy facade was a forcefully determined personality. The same might be said of him, and they had other things in common. Both were outsiders, he as a Jew, albeit a convert to the Church of England, she as a woman from a modest background pitched into a level of society where her unguarded conversation raised eyebrows, as did her penchant for dressing with as many feathers, bows, ribbons and diamonds as possible. 
 Their most important shared characteristic, however, was romantic self-dramatisation. Both elaborated on their origins in tellingly different ways: Disraeli talked his ancestors up, claiming to be descended from a grand Venetian family, while Mary Anne talked hers down, saying she had been a milliner, or a barefoot factory worker. None of it was true, but it was romantic. Theirs was a relationship based on a mixture of emotion and realism to which they gave a narrative shape, and eventually, as Hay says, it “wrote itself into happiness”. 
 They met through Mary Anne’s first husband, Wyndham Lewis, a Tory MP of little distinction, whose successful election campaign in Maidstone was masterminded by his wife. In the days of open hustings, a good show was essential and Mary Anne, sporting her husband’s campaign colours in purple ribbons with matching cap and shawl, made sure she caught the electors’ eye. She was so effective that the party decided to field a second candidate and Lewis chose Disraeli. The trio were soon a familiar sight in the constituency. A year later Lewis died and the two survivors embarked on a rocky road towards marriage. 
 Both wanted a grand passion and both wanted security, which for her meant love and for him money. Disraeli’s debts were enormous. Part of his urgency about getting into parliament was due to the immunity of sitting MPs from arrest. He wooed with a combination of histrionics – “not a wink did I sleep last night. I thought all was over between us” – and, when she accused him of fortune-hunting, apparent candour. “I write the sheer truth,” he retaliated, “[your] fortune proved to be much less than I … imagined”; it was so small, he insisted, as to tempt only “a penniless adventurer”. But Disraeli, broke and desperate, was not far from that. 
 Hay sets the details of their convoluted courtship dance in the context of an age which, between her birth and his, had moved from Enlightenment pragmatism to Romanticism. Mary Anne’s marriage to Lewis scored high on the Mrs Bennett scale of aspiration. He was a brilliant catch for the orphaned daughter of a seaman, and she was perhaps as happy as she expected to be. By the 1830s, Britain was in the grip of the romantic Gothic revival. Disraeli was one of many young men who modelled himself explicitly on Byron. The parliament in which he took his seat was being rebuilt round him into a Gothic palace which reinvented national history as a medieval romance, one that he further popularised in his own idealistic “Young England” novels. 
 Having persuaded themselves they were in love, the Disraelis married in 1839. Mary Anne had no idea how bad her husband’s debts were, or that in her absence he allowed bailiffs into her London house to raise more money against the contents. Nor was she aware of the significance of the other woman in his life, his sister Sarah. Disraeli wrote frankly, secretly and often to Sarah, and their relationship had some of the intensity of William and Dorothy Wordsworth ’s. At a time when the sexes were segregated in so many areas of life, sibling relationships could supply a need for intimacy unmet elsewhere, as could same-sex friendships. Disraeli enjoyed these too, and Hay, who is subtle in her reading of 19th-century emotions, concludes that he might today be called bisexual, but as neither bisexuality nor homosexuality was a defined idea at the time, she does not impose it retrospectively. 
 Instead she traces the course of “a marriage in three acts”. The first, if tempestuous, was good humoured. A list of their contrasting characteristics, which Mary Anne drew up and Disraeli copied, is a catalogue of opposites. He is “Very Calm”, she “Very effervescent”, and so on. Their only shared enthusiasm is Maidstone, his constituency. Clearly humour was another bond. By 1847, however, money worries, difficulties with in-laws on both sides and what sounds like a manic episode in which Mary Anne’s usual stream of free association seems to have run out of control, had rubbed the self-willed romance thin. They were leading mostly separate lives and when they met they rowed. 
 Yet as Disraeli climbed what he was the first to call “the greasy pole” of politics, relations improved. When the Earl of Derby became prime minister in 1852, he asked Disraeli to be chancellor. Even Disraeli lacked the nerve to claim that he was good with money, but Derby reassured him breezily that “they give you the figures”. Mary Anne was re‑enamoured of her husband and when, soon afterwards, she became seriously ill he in turn realised how much he depended on his wife, “the soul of my house”. 
 As the demands of public life increased, so, too, did the charms of home. After his success in getting the 1867 Reform Act through parliament, Disraeli’s supporters planned a celebratory dinner, but he preferred to return to Mary Anne who was waiting with “a raised pie from Fortnum and Mason’s and a bottle of champagne”. In this Indian summer of their marriage they were more honest and more likable. Hay brings out Mary Anne’s qualities – her warmth, resilience and the contrast between her exuberant manners and the discretion with which she dispensed generosity to those in need. Disraeli became so proud of her that he persuaded the Queen to make her a baroness in her own right. By the time she died in 1872 the nation had taken her to their hearts. Disraeli was grief-stricken. Ahead of his own death, nine years later, he left instructions vetoing a funeral in Westminster Abbey. Instead he was buried with the least possible ceremony beside Mary Anne at the parish church of Hughenden in Buckinghamshire. 
 As with all the best biographers, Hay makes her readers drag their feet towards the end, reluctant to part company with people she has made us know and feel for. Her book has turned the Disraelis’ uneven romance into a real love story. How pleased they would have been.
