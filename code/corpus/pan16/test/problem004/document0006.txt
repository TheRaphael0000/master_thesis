Literature seems to be mainly about absences: giving words to what we can’t quite grasp, to what we wish were there, to what we fear we’ve lost. The Latin expression “ verba volant, scripta manent” (“the spoken word flies away, the written word remains”) can be read as a profession of faith in the power of the text to hold on to what is fleeting. And yet, there are presences that every literary text seems to require: the writer who describes these absences and the reader who acknowledges them. To imagine the word or the world without us as witnesses is an almost impossible exercise. 
 This unbearable absence lies at the heart of Mireille Juchau’s third novel. In an idyllic Australian landscape, now polluted by the chemical emissions of a gas mining company, a family falls apart. Stefan, a Jewish immigrant from Germany, and former artist Evangeline, his wife, are the survivors of a commune called The Hive, founded by a psychotic leader in the aptly named Ghost Mountains of New South Wales and destroyed by an unexplained fire. The couple have three daughters: two adolescents, Tess and Meg, and the infant Pip, who has died of leukaemia before the novel begins. Pip is the central absence of the story. Around her ghost, the other family members mourn: Tess by refusing to speak, Evangeline by constructing a totemic monument hanging Pip’s medicine bottles and boxes from a tree, Stefan by drinking. Meg alone attempts to lend coherence to her crumbling family, knowing that she cannot but fail. Other characters form a fragmented tragic chorus around the protagonists: Jim, Tess’s teacher who left Sydney under a cloud; Tom Tucker, an apocalyptic figure warning his neighbours of impending ecological disaster. 
 These absences – of language, of art, of reason, of cohesion – are set in a natural framework that is also failing. Monstrous creatures such as a double-headed fish appear in the waters, clear-cut logging turns once verdant areas into deserts, the air itself appears to become poisonous. Above all, the bees are disappearing. Stefan is a beekeeper. He inherited the vocation from his grandfather, harvesting honey in a bombed Berlin after the war. Now, like a public emblem of his private loss, his bees are swarming but fail to build new colonies, the queens become feeble and cannot nourish the hive, the workers and drones can’t seem to fulfil their tasks. When Meg asks her father whether the vanishing bees were theirs, Stefan can only answer in broken English and in cosmic terms: “The bees are belonging to the earth and then came the interfering of man. We should give up trying to control them.” And then Stefan, in the voice of God, quotes from the Midrash, the Jewish traditional compendium of biblical stories: “And everything that I created, I created for you. Be careful not to spoil or destroy my world – if you do, there will be nobody after you to repair it.” 
 As befits a book whose theme is so explicitly absence, mysteries abound: hints of unanswered questions, clues to unasked riddles. Whose body is it found in an abandoned car wreck? What tragedy caused Jim to leave Sydney and seek refuge in the wilderness? What incident during her time at The Hive left such terrible scars on Evangeline? What deep connections seem to bind all the many characters together? 
 Juchau’s style is perfectly poised, elegant and restrained. Almost any page of this astonishing novel offers proof of a writer of great poetic power. Here is Evangeline, pregnant with Pip, leafing through Tess’s school notebook: “Evangeline stands at the table now, head bent, wet hair glued to her neck, and turns the pages. She gnaws a fingernail, shifts from foot to foot, redistributing baby weight, easing the sacral muscle spasms. She’s ticking, on the verge of a cry or a scream, full of anticipatory restlessness. She reads it over again, lips moving, one finger travelling beneath each word, this account of a time she’d not been part of, this glimpse of Daughterland.” 
 There is a term from the visual arts, “reserve”, that denotes the empty space on an otherwise populated canvas or paper, kept by the artist for a later completion that is often never realised. This visible absence, the promise of something essential and as yet unfulfilled, allows viewers to construct their own mental picture and in a sense collaborate on the work presented to them. The World Without Us is built around just such a “reserve”. The result is an extraordinarily vivid novel, elegant, convincing, intelligent and profoundly moving.
