Edinburgh council is now using how much a person drinks or smokes to judge whether they should receive help to pay the bedroom tax. Tenants applying for a discretionary housing payment are asked to detail how much they spend on "luxuries" such as TV, drink and mobile phones. If it is thought to be too much, they don't get help to pay the rent. 
 Edinburgh is the first council to use discretionary housing payment in such a way. Perhaps what is most shocking is that the move barely comes as a surprise. 
 Discretionary funds were always the embodiment of the worst version of social security. And one that is now creeping on to an agenda that says these sort of benefits should be the norm. The clue is in the title. This isn't help that is an entitlement, but to be awarded at the giver's discretion. 
 What factors are used to decide whether a person is worthy of help? Well, that's for those with power to decide and for those in need to scrape and follow. 
 The government is becoming indistinguishable from Victorian charity when the wealthy paternalist decides which of the poor and infirm deserved to be helped. And it's certainly not those who smoke and appease their kids with Sky TV. 
 The media provides the supporting images. Not just the press but – for those allowed one – the television. This summer, be it the BBC's We All Pay Your Benefits or Channel 4's Benefits Britain 1949 , propaganda has been pumped into our living rooms on a weekly basis. 
 Jamie Oliver now wades in deciding that the reason a child doesn't eat healthy meals is because their parents have bought "a massive TV". 
 The poor are poor because of their own failings, the story goes. As many of these token poor people are also unwell or disabled, we are now led to believe that even the sick are sick because they have done something wrong. This lets the real causes off the hook so well. Convince us that inequality is down to individual indolence and the structure can continue to rot without a second thought. 
 What's happening in Edinburgh is the perfect example, where people are having their lives inspected because benefit cuts have been introduced and the emergency support pot is incompetently small. 
 Bad, poverty-perpetuating policy isn't the problem. It is the fact that the poor spend too much on fags and booze. The bedroom tax can continue to kick disabled people out of their homes and the smoke and mirrors of dissecting "lifestyle choices" encourages other people to look away. 
 The smoking, drinking, idle poor is a concept that, much like the shirking disabled, makes a good scapegoat. It distracts from the big things, like only division and blame can. 
 If disabled people are different and the poor are in poverty because of their own choices, other people can never be such things themselves. Moralising is soothing. There's a reason we don't run a society on charity any more. The government is meant to provide some dignity. 
 I thought we'd swapped the humiliation of the begging bowl for the civility of the benefit form. The state now has measures in place to help the people who need it, but only it seems after it has sniffed their breath for fags and booze and checked the size of their television screen.
