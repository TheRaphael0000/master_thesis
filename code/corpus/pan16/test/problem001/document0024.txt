The consultation on higher earners being charged higher rents to stay in social housing has led to suggestions of ghettoisation for the sector. But even without policies designed to concentrate disadvantage in social housing, 44% of England's lone parents and 24% of the over-75s now live in social housing. The average gross weekly income of social renting couples is £291, compared with £552 a week for couples renting privately. Less than a quarter of social tenants work full time, compared with two-thirds of private renters. 
 Government cuts are having a disproportionate effect on social tenants putting social landlords at the coal face, trying to ease the impact of a groundswell of redundancies, benefit cuts, service closures, family breakdown, and declining physical and mental health. They may be spreading themselves too thin: providing a safe, affordable home is no longer enough – landlords are now tasked with providing debt advice, employment support, digital inclusion, floating support to tackle mental health and substance abuse problems – the list goes on. What's more, the funding previously available to fulfil some of these roles is being cut too. 
 Recent Demos research explored opportunities for a response to this situation. Utilising strong relationships with their tenants, social landlords can leverage untapped skills and foster self-organisation and support networks to help their tenants look after each other. We found tenants had ideas of how they could get involved and develop their skills in the process. 
 But social landlords must also look for new funding opportunities if they are to provide tenants with the range of services they increasingly need. Traditional funding might have dried up, but funding for the prevention of social problems and the integration of services is springing up. The most obvious examples is the "troubled families" funding for multi-agency working. 
 Social landlords have natural advantages over rival providers. They have a propensity for preventive, personalised, joined-up service delivery – exactly the things the government says it is looking for. Their strong relationships with their tenants – the target groups for much of this work – allows them to spot problems early on. And they can help co-ordinate other services, creating hubs out of people's homes. 
 Another example where social landlords could be bidding for new funding is reablement. The government is ploughing £162m into schemes to help people discharged from hospital to settle back home. 
 In a Demos report launched on Tuesday 26 June we argue that about 50% of social housing providers could be bidding for such contracts. Moving with the times for social landlords doesn't mean social landlords radically changing what they do – it just means being proactive in spotting opportunities for using their winning formula.
