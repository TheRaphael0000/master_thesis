Single homeless people often have limited housing options because they have low income, complex needs and no right to council support to secure permanent housing. For them, private hostels can offer an alternative to rough sleeping. However, there is limited understanding of the experiences and inequalities of living in these properties. 
 New research by Northumbria University into privately run hostels, known as HMOs (houses in multiple occupation), in the north-east, found several properties occupied by vulnerable men with high incidences of alcohol dependency and poor physical and mental health. There were frequent complaints of insufficient heating, broken door locks and damp. Unsurprisingly, the physical conditions were reported as exacerbating residents’ health problems. Of further concern were the psychological and social conditions, including feelings of insecurity, high levels of noise, theft, violence and unorthodox management practices. 
 The experiences of private hostel residents are largely unknown. Yet demand for shared accommodation is forecast to rise as a result of housing and welfare benefit cuts. Single homeless people fall outside government homelessness statistics and those living in private hostels often struggle to engage with support services. They are also let down by the regulatory system for HMOs. Licensed HMOs are subject to inspection only once every five years, while councils are limited to enforcing narrow HMO regulations and health and safety standards. 
 Pockets of good practice in several boroughs in the north-east are beginning to have a positive effect. In one area, for example, proprietors of large HMOs that cater for homeless people are working with a council and a national homelessness charity to improve physical standards and allow provision of support services to residents. Training in safeguarding is being given to landlords. 
 Building on this, the North East Homeless Think Tank – a regional group of academics, researchers and policy officers from national and local homelessness and research organisations – is urging all general election candidates in the region to pledge support to its Homelessness Charter, which outlines five recommendations. These include extending the statutory definition of homelessness to cover people living in temporary accommodation, a legal requirement to record the number of single homeless people in England and for all HMOs that cater for homeless people to be inspected every six months. 
 Raising awareness of these hidden lives is only the beginning. Further action is needed to protect vulnerable residents and help them to improve their health and wellbeing.
