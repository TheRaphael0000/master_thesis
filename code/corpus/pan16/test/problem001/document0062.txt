There is a sense of national outrage at the seemingly endless stream of revelations concerning the sexual abuse of children by people in the public eye. While such outrage is understandable, I can't help being struck by the simultaneous lack of concern about the cuts to the services and support many survivors of sexual abuse depend on. 
 Mental health problems are a very common consequence of sexual abuse. An overview of research in this area, conducted by Anne Lazenbatt for the NSPCC suggests that as many as 80% of young adults who have been sexually or physically abused, or both, are found to meet the diagnostic criteria for at least one psychiatric disorder by the time they are 21. By the time they reach their late 20s, they are twice as likely to have attempted suicide as someone who has never been abused. 
 Around half of people using mental health services report histories of sexual and/or physical abuse and there is masses of research demonstrating the fact that those who have experienced childhood abuse show a greatly increased risk of developing depression, severe anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, drug and alcohol problems, eating disorders, various personality disorders and problems with self-harm. Survivors of childhood sexual abuse very often suffer from feelings of guilt, responsibility and powerlessness and may struggle with interpersonal relationships. 
 None of which is surprising. But neither does it have to be an inevitable life sentence. With the media focus firmly on celebrity perpetrators, we hear very little of survivors of abuse, other than that their lives have been "ruined" as a consequence of what happened. An expression I loathe precisely because it suggests that there's nothing to be done for them. It seems almost to justify our turning away. Their lives are ruined. End of. 
 But we know that with appropriate and timely intervention, people can be helped enormously to overcome the legacy of childhood abuse. So it seems deeply ironic, to say the least, that this moment of national outrage at the damage done to our children should coincide with the decimation of the mental health services they need to recover. 
 Service users (and those unable to access services), mental health professionals, GPs, carers, charities and campaign groups are all warning in the starkest possible terms about the current crisis in mental health services. Mental health services are "a car crash" , according to professor Sue Bailey, outgoing president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. A survey of 500 GPs by the magazine Pulse has found that more than eight out of 10 believed that their local community mental health team could not cope with its caseload. 84% said that they were forced to prescribe "at least sometimes", because their local Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (Iapt) team was unable to help a patient. 
 According to Dr Maureen Baker, chair of the Royal College of GPs, "There is an urgent need to reassess the way funding is allocated so that services in the community have adequate resources to deliver more proactive, planned care to patients with mental illness." No kidding. Freedom of Information requests from the shadow public health minister, Luciana Berger, to England's 211 GP-led local NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), reveal that some parts of the NHS spend as little as 6.6% of their budget on mental health despite the fact that mental health problems account for 23% of the national disease burden. 
 To give just one example of the impact of this on individuals, a friend who suffers from bulimia so severe it has pretty much taken over every aspect of her life, and who also has a history of child sexual abuse, was referred to an eating disorders clinic for treatment 20 months ago. She is still on the waiting list. This sort of delay now seems normal in mental health services. But can you imagine anyone with a physical illness so severe that they cannot work or socialise being expected to wait almost two years for treatment to even begin? 
 There is nothing wrong with being outraged at the sexual abuse of children, or at the way those meant to protect them, children's homes, hospitals, schools, and so on, failed them and let them down. A public inquiry is important and welcome. But in confining our outrage to the past and ignoring the needs of the present, we are letting survivors down all over again.
