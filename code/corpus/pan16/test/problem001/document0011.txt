Isn’t it time that the contribution and achievements of disabled people gained a public presence through some kind of visual symbol? A letter to the Guardian in 1972 led to the setting up of the UK disabled people’s movement. Perhaps this article, more than 40 years later, can open up a discussion that gains the movement the physical recognition and visibility it deserves. 
 After all the razzmatazz of the Paralympics, we now seem to have settled back to being a society where disabled people are primarily perceived as scroungers to be hounded by the benefits system. This is despite the massive achievements of many, forcing themselves into the mainstream to live more equal lives. The public image imposed on disabled people is increasingly negative. We may also wonder how helpful ultimately positives like Eddie Redmayne’s award winning performance as Stephen Hawking will be for most disabled people. 
 The disabled people’s movement was the newest social movement to emerge in the last quarter of the 20th century. Yet so far there is no concrete celebration of its achievements. We had Alison Lapper temporarily in Trafalgar Square as an icon of bodily difference and disabled artist and activist Liz Crow’s empty plinth protest against the Nazi death programme and the message it holds for us today. All the great movements have their physical representations, whether it’s the statue of Gandhi unveiled last weekend to mark the struggle for India’s independence , the statue of Emmeline Pankhurst for women’s suffrage , Nelson Mandela for the anti-apartheid struggle, or the Manchester memorial to gay icon and father of modern computing Alan Turing. Here, unlike the US, there is not even a statue of a wheelchair user. 
 Some critics may suggest that such a symbol should wait until disabled people have actually realised the rights they’ve fought for. Others will argue that it can play a key role in helping them achieve that goal. 
 An obvious idea would be a statue of Paul Hunt, key founder of the UK disabled people’s movement. But is that what he or other disabled people would really want? Disabled people have fought determinedly for equality, access, and an inclusive democracy. Is this best demonstrated through another individualised image of a leader? What about some kind of collective or abstract image instead; perhaps a statue, but maybe a wall, mural, relief, structure, or accessible space? Hopefully, disabled people themselves would design such a tribute, with the innovative disability arts movement providing ideas and inspiration. And the project would be funded by public subscription, or perhaps through a whip-round from already impoverished disabled people’s organisations and disabled people themselves. Surely not through the kind of traditional can-rattling charity appeals that disabled people have long condemned as patronising and demeaning? 
 Most importantly, how would such an initiative be decided and made accountable to the disabled people it seeks to celebrate? Perhaps through a competition steered by respected disabled activists and artists, rather than the usual “great and good”. 
 Now, more than ever, we need a statement of disabled people’s right to a public presence in our society, a presence that won’t be intimidated either by hate crime or the discriminatory impact of government policies on disabled people. A first step towards this is listening to what disabled people themselves have to say.
