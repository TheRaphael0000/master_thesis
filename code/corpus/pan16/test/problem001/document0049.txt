Complaints to the ombudsman about social care have more than doubled in five years. But is this a sign of worsening services or evidence that people feel better able to make their voice heard? 
 East Sussex county council would like us to think the latter. In a new report it is named as the English council that in 2013 generated most social care complaints per head of population to the local government ombudsman (LGO). This, according to East Sussex, reflects its "excellent signposting" of dissatisfied people to the ombudsman. 
 "In East Sussex people's right to go to the LGO is actively encouraged as a positive step if they are unhappy with our approach," says the council, noting that the proportion of its complaints upheld by the ombudsman was below average. 
 Others may take a different view of the figures, which show a rise of 130% between 2009 and 2013 in all social care complaints received by the ombudsman. Almost 2,500 complaints and inquiries were dealt with last year. This has made social care the fastest growing area of the LGO's work and also the area with the highest rate of complaints upheld (46%). 
 Part of the explanation for this trend will be that the LGO's remit was extended in 2010 to include complaints about privately funded social care and any registered care service. But the number of complaints about private providers remains low, at 9% of the 2013 total, and the proportion is not growing. 
 Most complaints concern assessment of need, care planning and funding or charges. However, complaints about residential care are rising fastest and last year accounted for more than twice the number of grievances about home care. 
 This is the first year the LGO has named councils that attract most complaints. The top five, adjusted for population size, are East Sussex, Redbridge in east London, Blackpool, Bromley in south London and Walsall. As the report points out, these areas are not necessarily those identified in surveys as having the highest rates of dissatisfaction with social care provision. 
 The number of complaints against private providers is too low for any meaningful analysis, but the LGO says this, of itself, should make providers think about whether their complaints systems are good enough. 
 Ombudsman Jane Martin says: "I hope that by publishing these statistics, I will encourage care providers to ensure that the public are given a complaints process that is easy to access, effective and accountable." 
 Anna Bradley, chair of Healthwatch England , the consumer body for health and social care, says complaints processes should be so responsive that people have no need to go to the ombudsman. But the growth in cases at least shows that people are making their voices heard. "It may seem counter-intuitive, but we should look on the increasing number of complaints as a good thing."
