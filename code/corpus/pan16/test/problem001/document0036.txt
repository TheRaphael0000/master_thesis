The elderly lady had urgently asked to see the pharmacist, and was clearly distressed. I feared some error had been made with her medication, but she had been alarmed not by dispensing, but by correspondence. A letter from the doctor is something few older people take lightly. 
 For some years she had been taking a single tablet each morning for her blood pressure. Now a letter had arrived blithely informing her that her tablets "have now been classified as a Black Light drug. This means they are no longer recommended for prescribing on the NHS". The letter went on to say that her GP would switch her to two separate prescriptions equivalent to her current treatment, that her repeat prescription had been changed accordingly on the practice computer, but could she use up her current supply before ordering new tablets, to avoid waste. The letter was signed "on behalf of the surgery", with no indication of individual responsibility. 
 So distant from the government mantra of "No decision about me, without me", it is hard to imagine correspondence more likely to have raised our customer's blood pressure. There was no explanation for the change. She, not surprisingly, had no clue what "black light drug" meant. She was genuinely concerned about the dangers of taking for so long tablets that were now banned, and had no intention of "using up her current supply". 
 I explained the jargon – the primary care trust website defines "black light" as a "combination product significantly more expensive than the individual generic drugs". She was relieved to discover it was entirely a cost-saving measure. And she was quite prepared to help the NHS save money, in this case a monthly reduction from £9.52 to £3.19. 
 The pricing of drugs in the NHS is a byzantine affair, but once a brand-name drug loses its patent protection, generic versions of equivalent quality sprout up at a fraction of the original price, often via a subsidiary company of the original manufacturer. The recent loss of patent protections on leading brand-name cholesterol-lowering agents has also resulted in patients being switched to generic drugs – equally efficacious and a fraction of the cost. Having to explain to agitated customers that those unrecognised tablets are the result of an unannounced switch to a generic drug, as opposed to a presumed dispensing error, has become a routine event. Lower costs are associated with lower quality, but the usual response on being reassured of the quality of their medicine is one of "Why didn't someone tell me first?". In a patient-centred health service, they would have been asked. 
 Pharmacies, too, unwittingly jeopardise patients' health by continually changing generic suppliers, chasing down the best price, resulting in the frequent provision of tablets of differing shape, size and colour. A patient taking five medications produced by five generic manufacturers, theoretically faces 3,125 possible arrays of tablets for what are, chemically and clinically speaking, the same drugs. 
 Aaron Kesselheim, assistant professor of medicine in the division of pharmacoepidemiology at the Brigham and women's hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, in his investigation on the impact of generic drugs from a patient's perspective, showed that changing the shape or colour of tablets significantly increased the likelihood that patients will stop taking their treatment as prescribed. Dialogue with patients to explain generic prescribing is not only respectful, it is a clinical requirement. Their involvement in the decision to go generic will be indispensable – both figuratively and literally – if the NHS is to safely make the savings on offer.
