It emerged last week that thousands of social housing tenants in receipt of housing benefit (HB) for the same home since 1 January 1996 were exempt from the bedroom tax. This unintended exemption dates back to an almost obsolete regulation introduced by a Conservative former secretary of state, Peter Lilley, to ensure private tenants had their maximum HB rate set by independent rent officers. 
 In 1996, 700,000 tenants already getting HB were exempt from the new regulation as long as they stayed on HB in the same dwelling. This group of private tenants has largely dwindled away but the exemption has remained in place. The civil servants who drafted it never anticpated the bedroom tax. 
 In November, a housing benefit appeals officer contacted me after a tribunal asked whether tenants appealing against bedroom-tax decisions had received HB since 1 January 1996. What had this to do with bedroom tax? I studied the regulations and concluded that a drafting quirk means a measure designed to protect private tenants 18 years ago applied to social tenants now. 
 I posted a summary of my analysis on the benefits advisers' forum Rightsnet. I expected forum members to note it for future reference. Instead, it went viral. 
 Bedroom-tax campaigner Joe Halewood cited the thread in his blog and on Twitter ; his many followers retweeted it. I realised the exponential effect of social media. I was struck by the variety of people interested: individual claimants, councillors, professional organisations, housing lawyers and HB officers. 
 The Department for Work and Pensions could not ignore it. Councils needed guidance, and last week the DWP issued a bulletin urgently advising councils to award arrears of HB to people affected by the loophole. This was a satisfying, unexpectedly swift conclusion. 
 It's still unclear how many people are affected. Few councils hold records from 1996 in searchable databases. Searching surviving archives is labour-intensive. 
 Exeter council, which pre-empted the DWP's bulletin and applied the exemption on its own initiative in December, says 31 out of 624 bedroom-tax cases are exempt â€“ about 5%. Nationally this suggests 26,000 claimants are exempt. Privately, councils have reported to me initial estimates ranging from 2% to 7.5%. 
 The DWP says it will close the loophole. The regulations setting eligible rent for HB have become so tortuous this was an accident waiting to happen. Any amendment may cause further unintended consequences. The HB social media community will watch closely.
