Stop what you’re doing and ask yourself this question: “If you were to have a serious accident that left you with a severe disability, would you want to be shut away, out of sight and out of mind?” This is a scenario no one wants to imagine, but for Linda Burnip, a spokeswoman for the campaign group Disabled People Against Cuts (DPAC), it illustrates what is at stake for people with severe disabilities if last-ditch efforts to save a vital benefit fail in the run-up to the election. 
 Short of a late surge of widespread public outrage and an inconceivable volte-face on the part of the government, one of the most important protections for disabled people, the Independent Living Fund (ILF), will soon cease to exist in England. Despite vigorous campaigning , protests , petitions and legal challenges , the ILF will close in June. 
This ringfenced pool of money – introduced almost 30 years ago to help around 18,000 of the most severely disabled people live independently in their own homes and communities – should never have been a target for government cuts. It is an essential benefit is often used to supplement other support. By paying for full-time home care packages, for example, people can work or participate in the kinds of everyday activities the rest of us take for granted. 
 The culling of the ILF is one of the most regressive, inexplicable and indefensible actions taken under the coalition’s austerity programme (and let’s face it there’s no shortage of competition), adding to a raft of reforms and cuts that have already disproportionately affected disabled people , and in particular those with severe impairments. 
 As Burnip puts it: “The closure of the ILF in England will exacerbate the grave and systematic violation of disabled people’s rights to live independently in the community.” 
 Over the years, the ILF has represented much more than vital financial support as a route to independence for individuals with severe disabilities, including thousands with learning disabilities. It has been a potent symbol of progressive shifts in how society views disability and disabled people. Its loss, as one campaigner told me, “is like 30 years of campaigning and progress have been stripped away in one go”. And, just in case anyone out there is assuming Labour would reverse the coalition’s decision, think again. Despite pleas from campaigners, Labour has refused to halt the closure if elected. 
 This month, disability rights activists are stepping up efforts to highlight what the loss of ILF will mean. They will be protesting at Labour’s policy launch in Birmingham at the weekend, and are calling on the government to agree to a UN rapporteur visiting the UK to investigate policies that have an impact on disabled people. 
 Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are making their own arrangements to safeguard funds for severely disabled people. The Green party has announced that reinstating the benefit will be one of its top election campaign priorities. 
 A Green party spokeswoman described its scrapping as “shortsighted [and] yet another onslaught on the rights and benefits of the disabled”. 
 The government has repeatedly denied that the abolition of ILF in England is a cut, saying it is transferring millions of pounds to local authorities “to ensure disabled people get the targeted support they need”. But with cash-strapped councils teetering on the brink of financial meltdown and redrawing the eligibility criteria for disabled people applying for additional support, disability campaigners are right to fear that there is no guarantee that their needs, other than the most basic, will be met. 
 Sometimes it is absolutely necessary to defend something on principle. This is one of those occasions. If we stand back and say nothing while something so critical to protecting the dignity and rights of disabled people disappears, we are as much to blame as the government for the consequences.
