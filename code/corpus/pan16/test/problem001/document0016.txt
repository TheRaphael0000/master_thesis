There are some statistics that no matter how many times they are repeated continue to shock and bewilder. Among these is the number of people incarcerated in the US. Between 1980 and 2008, the prisoner population more than quadrupled from around 500,000 to 2.3 million. With just 5% of the world’s population, America now accounts for 25% of all people behind bars globally. 
 The overall figures are bad enough, as are the proportion of black and Hispanic prisoners, who are grossly overrepresented in the US criminal justice system. But it is the rise in the female prison population, including mothers, which is especially alarming. Since 1980, the number of women in jail has grown 1.5 times faster than that of men – a rise of 646%. Women now comprise 7% of the national prison population. 
 Reform organisations such as the Sentencing Project point out that much of the blame rests with the “tough on crime” stance of politicians in the 1980s and 90s. The war on drugs over the same period also contributed to the rapid escalation in convictions and sentences. Women, it turns out, fared especially badly as more custodial sentences, many with mandatory minimums, were handed out for non-violent drugs offences. A third of all women currently in prison are serving their time for drugs-related crimes. 
 In the US, as elsewhere, women are far less likely to go to prison for a violent crime. Most are extremely vulnerable individuals who are highly likely to have been physically or sexually abused. Research has found that female inmates in the US are also significantly more likely than men to have mental health problems. Meanwhile, and with much wider social consequences, three-quarters are mothers, two-thirds of whom have children under the age of 18. 
The picture is undoubtedly a grim one, but for the first time in decades there is a genuine possibility that it won’t stay that way. In the past couple of years there has been a sea change across America in attitudes towards imprisonment. On the political right, arguments about the high cost of mass incarceration have won many round to advocating for change as a way of saving money, while on the left, the social price being paid is galvanizing the promotion of alternatives to custody. 
 From new state laws revising parole options for people convicted as juveniles to President Obama’s second term prioritising reform , and more recently Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton making criminal justice reform a centrepiece of her campaign , undoing the mistakes of the past are on the agenda. At a grassroots level, campaigning groups are also contributing to the momentum. 
 According to Niaz Kasravi, deputy director at the California-based group the Anti-Recidivism Coalition (ARC), female incarceration is gaining greater attention. One example, she says, is recent efforts by Democratic congresswoman Karen Bass who has been leading projects to canvass suggestions from former prisoners for improvements across the justice system. 
 “Re-entry” initiatives that help improve the prospects of women and girls after imprisonment, including connecting with children and families, have also become more prominent. 
 There are echoes of the US situation in the UK too. For a start, the female prison population almost trebled between 1993 and 2005. There have been some signs of a reversal but as of May this year there were still almost 4,000 women in English and Welsh prisons. Meanwhile, despite moves to build yet more jails and savage cuts to prisons and probation (with yet more intense pressure on departmental budgets via Wednesday’s spending review), reformist moves are nevertheless in the air, with Michael Gove planning to implement a range of changes such as early release. 
 There has been a shift of focus towards gender aspects of imprisonment too. One significant legal move was the Offender Rehabilitation Act 2014, where Section 10 stipulates that women’s needs “must be identified and addressed”. On Wednesday the Prison Reform Trust (PRT) will publish a new briefing paper that lays out recommendations for reforms aimed at aiding women and mothers in particular, including alternatives to custody. Earlier this year the organisation launched a major campaign to reduce women’s imprisonment. 
 Jenny Earle, a director at PRT, says not only are many women doing time unnecessarily for minor offences when community-based options are proven to work, but where mothers are incarcerated it typically leads to poor outcomes for kids in the long term. One of the main proposals in the new discussion paper is to ensure magistrates are fully informed of women’s home circumstances, including caring responsibilities, when deciding if someone should be locked up. 
 On both sides of the Atlantic, too many women end up in prison and too many children are deprived of their primary carer for significant periods of time. Moves that seek to change this for good must be welcomed and supported.
