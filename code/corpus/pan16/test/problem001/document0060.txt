Some people within the government, as well as some outside it, have criticised the previous Labour administration's approach both to measuring child poverty and to reducing it. They say it was hugely expensive and looks set to have failed. Are these criticisms warranted? 
 Labour massively increased the amount of money – in real terms and as a share of national income – spent on benefits and tax credits, and those increases were disproportionately aimed at increasing financial support for families with children. Core benefit and tax credit entitlement for low-income families with children rose faster than inflation in at least eight of the 13 years of the previous government, and rose more quickly than median income (which is required to reduce a relative measure of poverty) in at least six of these. Financial support for a workless lone parent with one child was about 20% higher in real terms in 2010 than in 1997, 36% higher for a lone parent working part time on a low wage. 
 Simulations by myself and former colleagues at the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggest that, had financial support merely risen with inflation, child poverty would have risen to around 4.3 million by 2010. Instead, our best guess (before figures for 2010/11 are released later this week) is that it fell from 3.4 million to 2.5 million children, or by slightly more than a quarter. 
 The performance of parents in the labour market was important too: about a quarter of the fall in child poverty since 1998/99 can be linked to higher rates of employment among lone parents, and there are striking regional variations in child poverty trends that match very closely the labour market trends over the past decade. For example, the fall in child poverty between 1998 and 2004 was driven largely by northern regions of England and by Scotland, and these were the regions where parental employment rose the most. 
 More recently, child poverty has risen sharply in the West Midlands, where the impact of recession on parental employment has been the most marked. It is the only region where child poverty is higher than it was in 1998/99 and where employment is lower: the two facts are almost certainly related. 
 The previous government wanted child poverty to fall by a half during its time in office, so it is expected to miss its target. But reducing child poverty by 900,000 children was a remarkable achievement, certainly without historical precedent in the UK, and impressive compared with other countries. 
 There is no doubt that there is a very close link between the nearly sustained above-inflation increases in financial support for families with children over the past decade and the nearly sustained fall in child poverty. Given the coalition government's desire to close the fiscal deficit chiefly through spending cuts, the prognosis for child poverty over this decade is bleak.
