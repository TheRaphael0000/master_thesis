Councils can now offload their responsibility to house homeless families by finding them tenancies as short as 12 months in the private sector. 
 In the past, households assessed as homeless by a local authority – especially those in priority need because, for example, they have children – would be found temporary accommodation, followed by a lifetime social housing tenancy with a council or housing association. Now councils will be considered to have fulfilled their duty to the most vulnerable people by helping them find a private let from an unregulated private landlord. 
 One London tenancy officer has described this change, which came into effect last week, as the most "profound and astonishing" shift in housing policy – and one that has passed almost unnoticed. 
 On the same day, the Homes and Communities Agency approved the status of Grainger plc as a "registered provider" of social housing, which means it will build and manage new social homes and can bid for public funding to do so. It is not the first private organisation to achieve this status – 16 have already acquired the rights to play in the social housing field – but it is arguably the most significant. Grainger has a 100-year history as a provider of high-quality private rented accommodation and already manages 40,000 properties across the UK and Germany. 
 At its worst, though, the private rented sector is unstable, poor quality and even dangerous. Now the most vulnerable people will be placed there as a consequence of decades of under-investment in new social housing, leading to a huge shortage of social tenancies. 
 In addition, welfare reform means many of these vulnerable households will be found private sector homes where rents are cheaper miles from family, friends and their local communities and support networks. Some London councils are already looking as far away as Hull to expel homeless families. From April 2013, when a benefit cap of £500 a week for families is imposed, many more will follow. 
 The introduction of large respected institutions such as Grainger is an indication of how seriously the government is taking the need to solve the housing crisis. Institutional investment in good-quality private rented housing for "generation rent " is a political priority, and Grainger is the bastion of good practice in this area. Why not bring its expertise to bear on social housing's difficulties? 
 National Housing Federation chief executive, David Orr, who represents English housing associations, has no concerns about the growing role of private players. "The really critical discussion is about how we get the provision [of new housing]. The need is so vast, we need all hands to the pump," he says. 
 Grainger, an efficient and agile private sector company, will now be able to compete with traditional housing associations for what little remains of the government money for housing. This should not concern associations. As one senior policy adviser put it: "Housing has already been the biggest, most successful public-private financing scheme. It's hard to know who the challenge is greater for. [Grainger] might find they are not as competitive as they thought they were." 
 The common issue here is regulation: private landlords still operate relatively unchecked, the best in the market unrewarded and the worst unpunished for housing vulnerable tenants in unfit conditions. Careful management of this new social housing arm, Grainger Trust, will no doubt lead to a good public outcome. But it is surely time to find a way to regulate and monitor private landlords as they play a larger and more important role in housing our communities than ever before.
