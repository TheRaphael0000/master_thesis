A study by the Institute for Education published last month found that the 50-something generation is feeling sandwiched between child-raising, caring for elderly parents and the expectation that longer lifespans mean longer working lives. 
 For many, the first six weeks of a caring role are often decisive when it comes to staying in work. Caught in the headlights of a caring crisis, juggling work and children, navigating the care system can be the final straw. One in five carers gives up work to care full time. But many of these employees are companies’ most valuable staff: the 45-64 year-olds at the peak of their careers. 
 The Care Act 2014 gives councils a new duty to ensure there is a diverse range of services to meet people’s care and support needs, not just for those whom the council funds directly. For family carers having access to reliable, affordable personal and household services would allow them to care without being overwhelmed by day-to-day domestic chores. By recognising the needs of carers, employers can hold on to experienced staff. Getting this right can make a huge difference to the whole family and for the carer it has long-term consequences for their health and their wealth. 
 Attending the sixth European conference on personal and household services (PHS) in Brussels last month, I was struck that across Europe families, employers and government are struggling with this issue. PHS covers everything from cleaning and cooking, to shopping and fixing a light bulb, to more intimate personal care. 
 In many parts of Europe a significant number of people employed to do domestic chores are in the black (cash) economy. For some governments it is the lost tax revenues that drives policy to develop jobs in this field, for others it is about gender equality and increasing female participation in the labour market, as it is still predominantly women who carry out chores in the home. 
 In southern Italy the LaFemMe project is working with small- and medium-sized enterprises to help them put in place flexible working practices that suit women with caring responsibilities. It also works with local authorities to increase the supply of PHS, in this case mostly childcare. In Sweden, the government introduced tax breaks to stimulate the market in PHS and reduce the size of the black economy. The policy is estimated to have created 4,000 full-time jobs and increased tax receipts in the first two years of the scheme. 
 So what is happening in the UK? In 2012, in my role as care minister I worked with Employers for Carers and Carers UK , to hold a summit on these issues. Out of this a group was set up to look at the economic case for supporting carers to remain in the workforce. Six government departments, including HM Treasury, leading academics, charities and employers were involved. Its 2013 report, Supporting Working Carers , set out an economic case, the “multiplier” effect that can be triggered by demand for PHS supporting labour market participation, which in turn creates businesses and jobs in PHS services. 
 Recognising there was a problem and what the solution could be is good progress. But families already struggling with caring roles want action now. A statutory entitlement to up to five days of paid carers’ leave could pay for itself in reduced absenteeism and recruitment costs. In addition, working carer tax credits or care credits could build on existing support for families with children. 
 As our society ages and our working lives extend, there is a compelling case for recognising the development of PHS and care services as an essential part of our economic infrastructure to allow us to combine our work and caring responsibilities.
