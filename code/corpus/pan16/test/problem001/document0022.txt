It is now a well-worn adage among policymakers that the NHS needs to find a way of being financially sustainable without seeing the funding increases of the first part of this century. If those had continued, it would have led to the NHS encompassing all public spending in Britain by the middle of the century. 
 But what do taxpayers think? They say they are worried: nine in 10 people say the NHS will indeed face a severe funding problem in the future. Just over half now accept that there should be limits on what is spent on the NHS (a recent development, prompted by austerity). 
 But despite recognising the funding problem, the public are not yet ready for radical change. In our latest polling for the Foundation Trust Network , which will be presented on Wednesday at the FTN conference, two-thirds think the NHS should be given more funding so that it can continue to provide services in the same way it does at the moment. But only half of those want to pay more tax for it. And only 23% see NHS funding as a key issue facing Britain, down from 45% a decade ago and 70% in 1999. 
 This might still seem like a mountain to climb to those in the NHS trying to convince the public of the case for change. But the message is starting to filter through. Although 60% of those polled say the NHS is a symbol of what is great about Britain and we must do everything we can to maintain it, this is much lower than the 72% who said the same last time we asked the question at the end of 2012, which appeared in our State of the Nation report 2013. Now, 30% say the NHS was a great project for its time but we probably can't maintain it in its current form – only 20% said this in 2012. 
 So perhaps the public are starting to appreciate the scale of the problem. Certainly, when we ask them about some specific ways of reducing costs, they do not dismiss them out of hand. Waiting times remain controversial, with people less willing to accept increases the time they have to wait for treatment in order to reduce costs, but there are some changes to services that the public say they will accept. 
 Three-quarters think that people who go to A&E when they could be treated somewhere else should be required to go to a different health service instead, or that paramedics should treat patients at the scene whenever they can rather than taking them to hospital. Of course, they may mean that other people, rather than they, themselves, ought to be sent away if they wrongly present at A&E. 
 The challenge remains the public's rose-tinted spectacles – in the post-Olympic glow, 45% said the NHS was the thing that made them most proud to be British, more than the royal family or the armed forces. If the NHS – not politicians, but leading clinicians – can engage with the public on specific service changes they can support, a transition to a more focused and efficient NHS may just be possible, without general tax rises. 
 But don't expect this to be easy – the NHS remains the closest thing the British have to a religion.
