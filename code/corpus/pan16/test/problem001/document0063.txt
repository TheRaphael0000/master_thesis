A new catastrophe graph, the "Jaws of Doom", is doing the rounds in local government (following on from the Barnet Graph of Doom ). It is a simple illustration that shows a "budget pressures" line rising steeply to the top right of the grid, and a "grant reductions" line crashing to the bottom right. It could be a child's depiction of a shark, or a crocodile, about to bite its prey. Lunch, in this case, appears to be local government itself. 
 The creator of the jaws graph is Birmingham council. The UK's biggest local authority will see its grant reduce by £332m by 2016-17. Over that period costs will rise by an estimated £273m. That means £600m of savings, a cut of nearly half of the council's controllable spending. "It's the end of local government as we know it," says the city's leader, Sir Albert Bore. 
 For Birmingham, this means huge, rapid, painful cuts. Not "salami-sliced" efficiencies (those days are gone), but the axing of entire services. It is not alone, or even the worst hit. Newcastle upon Tyne has announced that it has "decommissioned" its entire arts funding budget. Tiny West Somerset district council, discovering that it has been effectively bankrupted by the cuts, considered abolishing itself. 
 We face the prospect of local authorities becoming financially unviable. A recent Audit Commission report says auditors consider 43% of larger single-tier councils and 34% of district councils to be at short- or medium-term risk. The most vulnerable authorities are those that have received the biggest cuts in funding and hold low levels of financial reserves. 
 Councils in England have cut £5bn and shed 230,000 jobs over two years. As a reward of sorts, the chancellor's autumn statement exempted local government from a 1% funding cut applied to other departments in 2013-14. But the Local Government Association (LGA) says councils face a potential £1bn shortfall as a result of technical funding changes. The following year, local government faces an additional 2% cut, and the next spending review is expected to continue the punitive pattern of spending reductions. 
 This will move the public perception of cuts on to an unprecedented level. The current evisceration of discretionary services, such as libraries and after-school clubs, will be joined by cuts to previously protected areas, such as adult social care and children's social services. Demand for these services will continue to rise, just as the capacity to cope shrinks. 
 Liverpool city council leader Joe Anderson has said this level of cuts will cause riots. Kent county council leader Paul Carter has warned "the tank is running on empty". And the Conservative chair of the LGA, Sir Merrick Cockell, has called the cuts "unsustainable". 
 Councils face an existential crisis: yet the communities and local government secretary, Eric Pickles, merely accuses them of paying chief executives too much , or spending too much on bottled mineral water. His obsession with weekly household waste collections is widely regarded with bemusement. More than half of councils say they will defy his call for them to freeze council tax. 
 The local government finance settlement – which enables every council in England to work out exactly how much cash it will have to spend in 2013-14 – is expected. All councils know it will be bad; the settlement will tell them precisely how bad (for some the margin amounts to tens of millions). The settlement is chronically late, a further blow for councils that must somehow stitch together a coherent budget by the end of January. Pickles's tardiness is not popular. 
 One council finance director I spoke to could barely contain his contempt. "It's appalling," he said through tightly clenched teeth.
