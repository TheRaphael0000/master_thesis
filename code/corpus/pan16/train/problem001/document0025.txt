At the centre of our parliamentary democracy is a debating chamber. It is a grand room, with the seating face to face (designed like choir stalls in a church), where the parties are two swords' widths apart so that disagreements cannot immediately lead to duels. 
 It is not incidental or merely "part" of the process, but absolutely the raw revelation of the activity of law-making in the UK. There is nowhere to hide in the chamber. New laws, budgets, foreign policy decisions – all these are challenged and interrogated by MPs across all parties. 
 Opposition MPs and government backbenchers can, through the Speaker, summon a minister to answer an urgent question. Ministers have to defend their decisions and the consequences in fierce debate with MPs. 
 Prime minister's questions (PMQs) is one element of that. What the public don't see is that these debates take place every day in the House of Commons on different subjects. The "spare rooms subsidy" debate was every bit as rowdy as an average PMQs. The home secretary's statement on passports last week was also pretty lively. 
 Bearing in mind the skills of politicians to offer answers to questions they have not been asked, it is essential that our House of Commons allows backbenchers and opposition spokesmen and women to really probe government ministers. This is why PMQs is so necessary. The rowdiness is part of the unscripted nature of the event. 
 Because anything can happen, and backbenchers can ask any question they want of the PM, there is always an added excitement about the session. But within that, it is a serious part of the transparency of our democracy. I wouldn't change it. It is for the Speaker to manage the volume and occasional silliness, but it is actually something we should all be proud of.
