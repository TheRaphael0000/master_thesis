i
made
the
last
of
my
journey
in
the
cold
end
of
december
,
in
a
mighty
dry
day
of
frost
,
and
who
should
be
my
guide
but
patey
macmorland
,
brother
of
tam
!
for
a
tow
-
headed
,
bare
-
legged
brat
of
ten
,
he
had
more
ill
tales
upon
his
tongue
than
ever
i
heard
the
match
of
;
having
drunken
betimes
in
his
brother
'
s
cup
.
i
was
still
not
so
old
myself
;
pride
had
not
yet
the
upper
hand
of
curiosity
;
and
indeed
it
would
have
taken
any
man
,
that
cold
morning
,
to
hear
all
the
old
clashes
of
the
country
,
and
be
shown
all
the
places
by
the
way
where
strange
things
had
fallen
out
.
i
had
tales
of
claverhouse
as
we
came
through
the
bogs
,
and
tales
of
the
devil
,
as
we
came
over
the
top
of
the
scaur
.
as
we
came
in
by
the
abbey
i
heard
somewhat
of
the
old
monks
,
and
more
of
the
freetraders
,
who
use
its
ruins
for
a
magazine
,
landing
for
that
cause
within
a
cannon
-
shot
of
durrisdeer
;
and
along
all
the
road
the
duries
and
poor
mr
henry
were
in
the
first
rank
of
slander
.
my
mind
was
thus
highly
prejudiced
against
the
family
i
was
about
to
serve
,
so
that
i
was
half
surprised
when
i
beheld
durrisdeer
itself
,
lying
in
a
pretty
,
sheltered
bay
,
under
the
abbey
hill
;
the
house
most
commodiously
built
in
the
french
fashion
,
or
perhaps
italianate
,
for
i
have
no
skill
in
these
arts
;
and
the
place
the
most
beautified
with
gardens
,
lawns
,
shrubberies
,
and
trees
i
had
ever
seen
.
the
money
sunk
here
unproductively
would
have
quite
restored
the
family
;
but
as
it
was
,
it
cost
a
revenue
to
keep
it
up
.
mr
henry
came
himself
to
the
door
to
welcome
me
:
a
tall
dark
young
gentleman
(
the
duries
are
all
black
men
)
of
a
plain
and
not
cheerful
face
,
very
strong
in
body
,
but
not
so
strong
in
health
:
taking
me
by
the
hand
without
any
pride
,
and
putting
me
at
home
with
plain
kind
speeches
.
he
led
me
into
the
hall
,
booted
as
i
was
,
to
present
me
to
my
lord
.
it
was
still
daylight
;
and
the
first
thing
i
observed
was
a
lozenge
of
clear
glass
in
the
midst
of
the
shield
in
the
painted
window
,
which
i
remember
thinking
a
blemish
on
a
room
otherwise
so
handsome
,
with
its
family
portraits
,
and
the
pargeted
ceiling
with
pendants
,
and
the
carved
chimney
,
in
one
corner
of
which
my
old
lord
sat
reading
in
his
livy
.
he
was
like
mr
henry
,
with
much
the
same
plain
countenance
,
only
more
subtle
and
pleasant
,
and
his
talk
a
thousand
times
more
entertaining
.
he
had
many
questions
to
ask
me
,
i
remember
,
of
edinburgh
college
,
where
i
had
just
received
my
mastership
of
arts
,
and
of
the
various
professors
,
with
whom
and
their
proficiency
he
seemed
well
acquainted
;
and
thus
,
talking
of
things
that
i
knew
,
i
soon
got
liberty
of
speech
in
my
new
home
.
in
the
midst
of
this
came
mrs
henry
into
the
room
;
she
was
very
far
gone
,
miss
katharine
being
due
in
about
six
weeks
,
which
made
me
think
less
of
her
beauty
at
the
first
sight
;
and
she
used
me
with
more
of
condescension
than
the
rest
;
so
that
,
upon
all
accounts
,
i
kept
her
in
the
third
place
of
my
esteem
.
it
did
not
take
long
before
all
patey
macmorland
'
s
tales
were
blotted
out
of
my
belief
,
and
i
was
become
,
what
i
have
ever
since
remained
,
a
loving
servant
of
the
house
of
durrisdeer
.
mr
henry
had
the
chief
part
of
my
affection
.
it
was
with
him
i
worked
;
and
i
found
him
an
exacting
master
,
keeping
all
his
kindness
for
those
hours
in
which
we
were
unemployed
,
and
in
the
steward
'
s
office
not
only
loading
me
with
work
,
but
viewing
me
with
a
shrewd
supervision
.
at
length
one
day
he
looked
up
from
his
paper
with
a
kind
of
timidness
,
and
says
he
,
"
mr
.
mackellar
,
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
you
do
very
well
.
"
that
was
my
first
word
of
commendation
;
and
from
that
day
his
jealousy
of
my
performance
was
relaxed
;
soon
it
was
"
mr
.
mackellar
"
here
,
and
"
mr
.
mackellar
"
there
,
with
the
whole
family
;
and
for
much
of
my
service
at
durrisdeer
,
i
have
transacted
everything
at
my
own
time
,
and
to
my
own
fancy
,
and
never
a
farthing
challenged
.
even
while
he
was
driving
me
,
i
had
begun
to
find
my
heart
go
out
to
mr
henry
;
no
doubt
,
partly
in
pity
,
he
was
a
man
so
palpably
unhappy
.
he
would
fall
into
a
deep
muse
over
our
accounts
,
staring
at
the
page
or
out
of
the
window
;
and
at
those
times
the
look
of
his
face
,
and
the
sigh
that
would
break
from
him
,
awoke
in
me
strong
feelings
of
curiosity
and
commiseration
.
one
day
,
i
remember
,
we
were
late
upon
some
business
in
the
steward
'
s
room
.
this
room
is
in
the
top
of
the
house
,
and
has
a
view
upon
the
bay
,
and
over
a
little
wooded
cape
,
on
the
long
sands
;
and
there
,
right
over
against
the
sun
,
which
was
then
dipping
,
we
saw
the
freetraders
,
with
a
great
force
of
men
and
horses
,
scouring
on
the
beach
.
mr
henry
had
been
staring
straight
west
,
so
that
i
marvelled
he
was
not
blinded
by
the
sun
;
suddenly
he
frowns
,
rubs
his
hand
upon
his
brow
,
and
turns
to
me
with
a
smile
.
"
you
would
not
guess
what
i
was
thinking
,
"
says
he
.
"
i
was
thinking
i
would
be
a
happier
man
if
i
could
ride
and
run
the
danger
of
my
life
,
with
these
lawless
companions
.
"
i
told
him
i
had
observed
he
did
not
enjoy
good
spirits
;
and
that
it
was
a
common
fancy
to
envy
others
and
think
we
should
be
the
better
of
some
change
;
quoting
horace
to
the
point
,
like
a
young
man
fresh
from
college
.
"
why
,
just
so
,
"
said
he
.
"
and
with
that
we
may
get
back
to
our
accounts
.
"
it
was
not
long
before
i
began
to
get
wind
of
the
causes
that
so
much
depressed
him
.
indeed
a
blind
man
must
have
soon
discovered
there
was
a
shadow
on
that
house
,
the
shadow
of
the
master
of
ballantrae
.
dead
or
alive
(
and
he
was
then
supposed
to
be
dead
)
that
man
was
his
brother
'
s
rival
:
his
rival
abroad
,
where
there
was
never
a
good
word
for
mr
henry
,
and
nothing
but
regret
and
praise
for
the
master
;
and
his
rival
at
home
,
not
only
with
his
father
and
his
wife
,
but
with
the
very
servants
.
they
were
two
old
serving
-
men
that
were
the
leaders
.
john
paul
,
a
little
,
bald
,
solemn
,
stomachy
man
,
a
great
professor
of
piety
and
(
take
him
for
all
in
all
)
a
pretty
faithful
servant
,
was
the
chief
of
the
master
'
s
faction
.
none
durst
go
so
far
as
john
.
he
took
a
pleasure
in
disregarding
mr
henry
publicly
,
often
with
a
slighting
comparison
.
my
lord
and
mrs
henry
took
him
up
,
to
be
sure
,
but
never
so
resolutely
as
they
should
;
and
he
had
only
to
pull
his
weeping
face
and
begin
his
lamentations
for
the
master
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
his
laddie
,
"
as
he
called
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
have
the
whole
condoned
.
as
for
henry
,
he
let
these
things
pass
in
silence
,
sometimes
with
a
sad
and
sometimes
with
a
black
look
.
there
was
no
rivalling
the
dead
,
he
knew
that
;
and
how
to
censure
an
old
serving
-
man
for
a
fault
of
loyalty
,
was
more
than
he
could
see
.
his
was
not
the
tongue
to
do
it
.
macconochie
was
chief
upon
the
other
side
;
an
old
,
ill
-
spoken
,
swearing
,
ranting
,
drunken
dog
;
and
i
have
often
thought
it
an
odd
circumstance
in
human
nature
that
these
two
serving
-
men
should
each
have
been
the
champion
of
his
contrary
,
and
blackened
their
own
faults
and
made
light
of
their
own
virtues
when
they
beheld
them
in
a
master
.
macconochie
had
soon
smelled
out
my
secret
inclination
,
took
me
much
into
his
confidence
,
and
would
rant
against
the
master
by
the
hour
,
so
that
even
my
work
suffered
.
"
they
are
a
'
daft
here
,
"
he
would
cry
,
"
and
be
damned
to
them
!

master

up

rebukit
the

macconochie
would
sneer

indeed
,
he
never
took
the
full
name
upon
his
lips
but
with
a
sort
of
a
whine
of
hatred
.
"
but
he
did
!
a
fine
employ
it
was
:
chapping
at

crying

end
,
they
couldnae

,
but
he
just
roared
and
prayed
and
grat
straucht
on
,
till
he
got
his
release
.
it
was
fair
murder
,
a
'

said
that
.
ask
john

now

again

sneered
through
his
nose

it
was
in
one
of
these
confidences
that
he
showed
me
the
carlisle
letter

the
print
of
the
horse

shoe
still
stamped
in
the
paper

indeed
,
that
was
our
last
confidence
;
for
he
then
expressed
himself
so
ill
-
naturedly
of
mrs
henry
that
i
had
to
reprimand
him
sharply
,
and
must
thenceforth
hold
him
at
a
distance
.
my
old
lord
was
uniformly
kind
to
mr
henry
;
he
had
even
pretty
ways
of
gratitude
,
and
would
sometimes
clap
him
on
the
shoulder
and
say
,
as
if
to
the
world
at
large
:
"
this
is
a
very
good
son
to
me
.
"
and
grateful
he
was
,
no
doubt
,
being
a
man
of
sense
and
justice
.
but
i
think
that
was
all
,
and
i
am
sure
mr
henry
thought
so
.
the
love
was
all
for
the
dead
son
.
not
that
this
was
often
given
breath
to
;
indeed
,
with
me
but
once
.
my
lord
had
asked
me
one
day
how
i
got
on
with
mr
henry
,
and
i
had
told
him
the
truth
.
"
ay
,
"
said
he
,
looking
sideways
on
the
burning
fire
,
"
henry
is
a
good
lad
,
a
very
good
lad
,
"
said
he
.
"
you
have
heard
,
mr
mackellar
,
that
i
had
another
son
?
i
am
afraid
he
was
not
so
virtuous
a
lad
as
mr
henry
;
but
dear
me
,
he
is
dead
,
mr
mackellar
!
and
while
he
lived
we
were
all
very
proud
of
him
,
all
very
proud
.
if
he
was
not
all
he
should
have
been
in
some
ways
,
well
,
perhaps
we
loved
him
better
!
"
this
last
he
said
looking
musingly
in
the
fire
;
and
then
to
me
,
with
a
great
deal
of
briskness
,
"
but
i
am
rejoiced
you
do
so
well
with
mr
henry
.
you
will
find
him
a
good
master
.
"
and
with
that
he
opened
his
book
,
which
was
the
customary
signal
of
dismission
.
but
it
would
be
little
that
he
read
,
and
less
that
he
understood
;
culloden
field
and
the
master
,
these
would
be
the
burthen
of
his
thought
;
and
the
burthen
of
mine
was
an
unnatural
jealousy
of
the
dead
man
for
mr
henry
'
s
sake
,
that
had
even
then
begun
to
grow
on
me
.
i
am
keeping
mrs
henry
for
the
last
,
so
that
this
expression
of
my
sentiment
may
seem
unwarrantably
strong
:
the
reader
shall
judge
for
himself
when
i
have
done
.
but
i
must
first
tell
of
another
matter
,
which
was
the
means
of
bringing
me
more
intimate
.
i
had
not
yet
been
six
months
at
durrisdeer
when
it
chanced
that
john
paul
fell
sick
and
must
keep
his
bed
;
drink
was
the
root
of
his
malady
,
in
my
poor
thought
;
but
he
was
tended
,
and
indeed
carried
himself
,
like
an
afflicted
saint
;
and
the
very
minister
,
who
came
to
visit
him
,
professed
himself
edified
when
he
went
away
.
the
third
morning
of
his
sickness
,
mr
henry
comes
to
me
with
something
of
a
hang
-
dog
look
.
"
mackellar
,
"
says
he
,
"
i
wish
i
could
trouble
you
upon
a
little
service
.
there
is
a
pension
we
pay
;
it
is
john
'
s
part
to
carry
it
,
and
now
that
he
is
sick
i
know
not
to
whom
i
should
look
unless
it
was
yourself
.
the
matter
is
very
delicate
;
i
could
not
carry
it
with
my
own
hand
for
a
sufficient
reason
;
i
dare
not
send
macconochie
,
who
is
a
talker
,
and
i
am
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
have
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
am
desirous
this
should
not
come
to
mrs
henry
'
s
ears
,
"
says
he
,
and
flushed
to
his
neck
as
he
said
it
.
to
say
truth
,
when
i
found
i
was
to
carry
money
to
one
jessie
broun
,
who
was
no
better
than
she
should
be
,
i
supposed
it
was
some
trip
of
his
own
that
mr
henry
was
dissembling
.
i
was
the
more
impressed
when
the
truth
came
out
.
it
was
up
a
wynd
off
a
side
street
in
st
.
bride
'
s
that
jessie
had
her
lodging
.
the
place
was
very
ill
inhabited
,
mostly
by
the
freetrading
sort
.
there
was
a
man
with
a
broken
head
at
the
entry
;
half
-
way
up
,
in
a
tavern
,
fellows
were
roaring
and
singing
,
though
it
was
not
yet
nine
in
the
day
.
altogether
,
i
had
never
seen
a
worse
neighbourhood
,
even
in
the
great
city
of
edinburgh
,
and
i
was
in
two
minds
to
go
back
.
jessie
'
s
room
was
of
a
piece
with
her
surroundings
,
and
herself
no
better
.
she
would
not
give
me
the
receipt
(
which
mr
henry
had
told
me
to
demand
,
for
he
was
very
methodical
)
until
she
had
sent
out
for
spirits
,
and
i
had
pledged
her
in
a
glass
;
and
all
the
time
she
carried
on
in
a
light
-
headed
,
reckless
way
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
now
aping
the
manners
of
a
lady
,
now
breaking
into
unseemly
mirth
,
now
making
coquettish
advances
that
oppressed
me
to
the
ground
.
of
the
money
she
spoke
more
tragically
.
"
it
is
blood
money
!
"
said
she
;
"
i
take
it
for
that
:
blood
money
for
the
betrayed
!
see
what
i
am
brought
down
to
!
ah
,
if
the
bonnie
lad
were
back
again
,
it
would
be
changed
days
.
but
he
is
deid
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
is
lyin
'
deid
amang
the
hieland
hills
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
bonnie
lad
,
the
bonnie
lad
!
"
she
had
a
rapt
manner
of
crying
on
the
bonnie
lad
,
clasping
her
hands
and
casting
up
her
eyes
,
that
i
think
she
must
have
learned
of
strolling
players
;
and
i
thought
her
sorrow
very
much
of
an
affectation
,
and
that
she
dwelled
upon
the
business
because
her
shame
was
now
all
she
had
to
be
proud
of
.
i
will
not
say
i
did
not
pity
her
,
but
it
was
a
loathing
pity
at
the
best
;
and
her
last
change
of
manner
wiped
it
out
.
this
was
when
she
had
had
enough
of
me
for
an
audience
,
and
had
set
her
name
at
last
to
the
receipt
.
"
there
!
"
says
she
,
and
taking
the
most
unwomanly
oaths
upon
her
tongue
,
bade
me
begone
and
carry
it
to
the
judas
who
had
sent
me
.
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
the
name
applied
to
mr
henry
;
i
was
staggered
besides
at
her
sudden
vehemence
of
word
and
manner
,
and
got
forth
from
the
room
,
under
this
shower
of
curses
,
like
a
beaten
dog
.
but
even
then
i
was
not
quit
,
for
the
vixen
threw
up
her
window
,
and
,
leaning
forth
,
continued
to
revile
me
as
i
went
up
the
wynd
;
the
freetraders
,
coming
to
the
tavern
door
,
joined
in
the
mockery
,
and
one
had
even
the
inhumanity
to
set
upon
me
a
very
savage
small
dog
,
which
bit
me
in
the
ankle
.
this
was
a
strong
lesson
,
had
i
required
one
,
to
avoid
ill
company
;
and
i
rode
home
in
much
pain
from
the
bite
and
considerable
indignation
of
mind
.
mr
henry
was
in
the
steward
'
s
room
,
affecting
employment
,
but
i
could
see
he
was
only
impatient
to
hear
of
my
errand
.
"
well
?
"
says
he
,
as
soon
as
i
came
in
;
and
when
i
had
told
him
something
of
what
passed
,
and
that
jessie
seemed
an
undeserving
woman
and
far
from
grateful
:
"
she
is
no
friend
to
me
,
"
said
he
;
"
but
,
indeed
,
mackellar
,
i
have
few
friends
to
boast
of
,
and
jessie
has
some
cause
to
be
unjust
.
i
need
not
dissemble
what
all
the
country
knows
:
she
was
not
very
well
used
by
one
of
our
family
.
"
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
him
refer
to
the
master
even
distantly
;
and
i
think
he
found
his
tongue
rebellious
even
for
that
much
,
but
presently
he
resumed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
this
is
why
i
would
have
nothing
said
.
it
would
give
pain
to
mrs
henry
.
.
.
and
to
my
father
,
"
he
added
,
with
another
flush
.
"
mr
.
henry
,
"
said
i
,
"
if
you
will
take
a
freedom
at
my
hands
,
i
would
tell
you
to
let
that
woman
be
.
what
service
is
your
money
to
the
like
of
her
?
she
has
no
sobriety
and
no
economy
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
for
gratitude
,
you
will
as
soon
get
milk
from
a
whinstone
;
and
if
you
will
pretermit
your
bounty
,
it
will
make
no
change
at
all
but
just
to
save
the
ankles
of
your
messengers
.
"
mr
henry
smiled
.
"
but
i
am
grieved
about
your
ankle
,
"
said
he
,
the
next
moment
,
with
a
proper
gravity
.
"
and
observe
,
"
i
continued
,
"
i
give
you
this
advice
upon
consideration
;
and
yet
my
heart
was
touched
for
the
woman
in
the
beginning
.
"
"
why
,
there
it
is
,
you
see
!
"
said
mr
henry
.
"
and
you
are
to
remember
that
i
knew
her
once
a
very
decent
lass
.
besides
which
,
although
i
speak
little
of
my
family
,
i
think
much
of
its
repute
.
"
and
with
that
he
broke
up
the
talk
,
which
was
the
first
we
had
together
in
such
confidence
.
but
the
same
afternoon
i
had
the
proof
that
his
father
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
business
,
and
that
it
was
only
from
his
wife
that
mr
henry
kept
it
secret
.
"
i
fear
you
had
a
painful
errand
to
-
day
,
"
says
my
lord
to
me
,
"
for
which
,
as
it
enters
in
no
way
among
your
duties
,
i
wish
to
thank
you
,
and
to
remind
you
at
the
same
time
(
in
case
mr
henry
should
have
neglected
)
how
very
desirable
it
is
that
no
word
of
it
should
reach
my
daughter
.
reflections
on
the
dead
,
mr
mackellar
,
are
doubly
painful
.
"
anger
glowed
in
my
heart
;
and
i
could
have
told
my
lord
to
his
face
how
little
he
had
to
do
,
bolstering
up
the
image
of
the
dead
in
mrs
henry
'
s
heart
,
and
how
much
better
he
were
employed
to
shatter
that
false
idol
;
for
by
this
time
i
saw
very
well
how
the
land
lay
between
my
patron
and
his
wife
.
my
pen
is
clear
enough
to
tell
a
plain
tale
;
but
to
render
the
effect
of
an
infinity
of
small
things
,
not
one
great
enough
in
itself
to
be
narrated
;
and
to
translate
the
story
of
looks
,
and
the
message
of
voices
when
they
are
saying
no
great
matter
;
and
to
put
in
half
a
page
the
essence
of
near
eighteen
months
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
this
is
what
i
despair
to
accomplish
.
the
fault
,
to
be
very
blunt
,
lay
all
in
mrs
henry
.
she
felt
it
a
merit
to
have
consented
to
the
marriage
,
and
she
took
it
like
a
martyrdom
;
in
which
my
old
lord
,
whether
he
knew
it
or
not
,
fomented
her
.
she
made
a
merit
,
besides
,
of
her
constancy
to
the
dead
,
though
its
name
,
to
a
nicer
conscience
,
should
have
seemed
rather
disloyalty
to
the
living
;
and
here
also
my
lord
gave
her
his
countenance
.
i
suppose
he
was
glad
to
talk
of
his
loss
,
and
ashamed
to
dwell
on
it
with
mr
henry
.
certainly
,
at
least
,
he
made
a
little
coterie
apart
in
that
family
of
three
,
and
it
was
the
husband
who
was
shut
out
.
it
seems
it
was
an
old
custom
when
the
family
were
alone
in
durrisdeer
,
that
my
lord
should
take
his
wine
to
the
chimney
-
side
,
and
miss
alison
,
instead
of
withdrawing
,
should
bring
a
stool
to
his
knee
,
and
chatter
to
him
privately
;
and
after
she
had
become
my
patron
'
s
wife
the
same
manner
of
doing
was
continued
.
it
should
have
been
pleasant
to
behold
this
ancient
gentleman
so
loving
with
his
daughter
,
but
i
was
too
much
a
partisan
of
mr
henry
'
s
to
be
anything
but
wroth
at
his
exclusion
.
many
'
s
the
time
i
have
seen
him
make
an
obvious
resolve
,
quit
the
table
,
and
go
and
join
himself
to
his
wife
and
my
lord
durrisdeer
;
and
on
their
part
,
they
were
never
backward
to
make
him
welcome
,
turned
to
him
smilingly
as
to
an
intruding
child
,
and
took
him
into
their
talk
with
an
effort
so
ill
-
concealed
that
he
was
soon
back
again
beside
me
at
the
table
,
whence
(
so
great
is
the
hall
of
durrisdeer
)
we
could
but
hear
the
murmur
of
voices
at
the
chimney
.
there
he
would
sit
and
watch
,
and
i
along
with
him
;
and
sometimes
by
my
lord
'
s
head
sorrowfully
shaken
,
or
his
hand
laid
on
mrs
henry
'
s
head
,
or
hers
upon
his
knee
as
if
in
consolation
,
or
sometimes
by
an
exchange
of
tearful
looks
,
we
would
draw
our
conclusion
that
the
talk
had
gone
to
the
old
subject
and
the
shadow
of
the
dead
was
in
the
hall
.
i
have
hours
when
i
blame
mr
henry
for
taking
all
too
patiently
;
yet
we
are
to
remember
he
was
married
in
pity
,
and
accepted
his
wife
upon
that
term
.
and
,
indeed
,
he
had
small
encouragement
to
make
a
stand
.
once
,
i
remember
,
he
announced
he
had
found
a
man
to
replace
the
pane
of
the
stained
window
,
which
,
as
it
was
he
that
managed
all
the
business
,
was
a
thing
clearly
within
his
attributions
.
but
to
the
master
'
s
fancies
,
that
pane
was
like
a
relic
;
and
on
the
first
word
of
any
change
,
the
blood
flew
to
mrs
henry
'
s
face
.
"
i
wonder
at
you
!
"
she
cried
.
"
i
wonder
at
myself
,
"
says
mr
henry
,
with
more
of
bitterness
than
i
had
ever
heard
him
to
express
.
thereupon
my
old
lord
stepped
in
with
his
smooth
talk
,
so
that
before
the
meal
was
at
an
end
all
seemed
forgotten
;
only
that
,
after
dinner
,
when
the
pair
had
withdrawn
as
usual
to
the
chimney
-
side
,
we
could
see
her
weeping
with
her
head
upon
his
knee
.
mr
henry
kept
up
the
talk
with
me
upon
some
topic
of
the
estates
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
could
speak
of
little
else
but
business
,
and
was
never
the
best
of
company
;
but
he
kept
it
up
that
day
with
more
continuity
,
his
eye
straying
ever
and
again
to
the
chimney
,
and
his
voice
changing
to
another
key
,
but
without
check
of
delivery
.
the
pane
,
however
,
was
not
replaced
;
and
i
believe
he
counted
it
a
great
defeat
.
whether
he
was
stout
enough
or
no
,
god
knows
he
was
kind
enough
.
mrs
henry
had
a
manner
of
condescension
with
him
,
such
as
(
in
a
wife
)
would
have
pricked
my
vanity
into
an
ulcer
;
he
took
it
like
a
favour
.
she
held
him
at
the
staff
'
s
end
;
forgot
and
then
remembered
and
unbent
to
him
,
as
we
do
to
children
;
burthened
him
with
cold
kindness
;
reproved
him
with
a
change
of
colour
and
a
bitten
lip
,
like
one
shamed
by
his
disgrace
:
ordered
him
with
a
look
of
the
eye
,
when
she
was
off
her
guard
;
when
she
was
on
the
watch
,
pleaded
with
him
for
the
most
natural
attentions
,
as
though
they
were
unheard
-
of
favours
.
and
to
all
this
he
replied
with
the
most
unwearied
service
,
loving
,
as
folk
say
,
the
very
ground
she
trod
on
,
and
carrying
that
love
in
his
eyes
as
bright
as
a
lamp
.
when
miss
katharine
was
to
be
born
,
nothing
would
serve
but
he
must
stay
in
the
room
behind
the
head
of
the
bed
.
there
he
sat
,
as
white
(
they
tell
me
)
as
a
sheet
,
and
the
sweat
dropping
from
his
brow
;
and
the
handkerchief
he
had
in
his
hand
was
crushed
into
a
little
ball
no
bigger
than
a
musket
-
bullet
.
nor
could
he
bear
the
sight
of
miss
katharine
for
many
a
day
;
indeed
,
i
doubt
if
he
was
ever
what
he
should
have
been
to
my
young
lady
;
for
the
which
want
of
natural
feeling
he
was
loudly
blamed
.
such
was
the
state
of
this
family
down
to
the
7th
april
,
1749
,
when
there
befell
the
first
of
that
series
of
events
which
were
to
break
so
many
hearts
and
lose
so
many
lives
.
on
that
day
i
was
sitting
in
my
room
a
little
before
supper
,
when
john
paul
burst
open
the
door
with
no
civility
of
knocking
,
and
told
me
there
was
one
below
that
wished
to
speak
with
the
steward
;
sneering
at
the
name
of
my
office
.
i
asked
what
manner
of
man
,
and
what
his
name
was
;
and
this
disclosed
the
cause
of
john
'
s
ill
-
humour
;
for
it
appeared
the
visitor
refused
to
name
himself
except
to
me
,
a
sore
affront
to
the
major
-
domo
'
s
consequence
.
"
well
,
"
said
i
,
smiling
a
little
,
"
i
will
see
what
he
wants
.
"
i
found
in
the
entrance
hall
a
big
man
,
very
plainly
habited
,
and
wrapped
in
a
sea
-
cloak
,
like
one
new
landed
,
as
indeed
he
was
.
not
,
far
off
macconochie
was
standing
,
with
his
tongue
out
of
his
mouth
and
his
hand
upon
his
chin
,
like
a
dull
fellow
thinking
hard
;
and
the
stranger
,
who
had
brought
his
cloak
about
his
face
,
appeared
uneasy
.
he
had
no
sooner
seen
me
coming
than
he
went
to
meet
me
with
an
effusive
manner
.
"
my
dear
man
,

said
he
,

a
thousand
apologies

disturbing
you

most
awkward

place

some
responsibility

the
cause

took

send

honest

much
distasted

it
came
at
once
into
my
mind
,
how
the
master

had
astonished
all
men
by
going
with
that
party

the

up
to

went

there
they

my
old

mr
henry

was
much
his
custom

pacing
the
low
end

in
the
midst
was
the
table
laid
for
supper
.
i
told
them
briefly
what
i
had
to
say
.
my
old
lord
lay
back
in
his
seat
.
mrs
henry
sprang
up
standing
with
a
mechanical
motion
,
and
she
and
her
husband
stared
at
each
other
'
s
eyes
across
the
room
;
it
was
the
strangest
,
challenging
look
these
two
exchanged
,
and
as
they
looked
,
the
colour
faded
in
their
faces
.
then
mr
henry
turned
to
me
;
not
to
speak
,
only
to
sign
with
his
finger
;
but
that
was
enough
,
and
i
went
down
again
for
the
colonel
.
when
we
returned
,
these
three
were
in
much
the
same
position
i

left
them
in

believe
no
word
had
passed

the
colonel
,
bowing
,

my

bowed
in
answer

then
the
colonel
turns
to
mrs

,
bowing
with
his
hat
upon
his
heart
and
the
most
killing
airs
of
gallantry
.

be

mistake

fine

he
hesitated
,

then
the
words
broke
from
him
with
a
singular
change
of
voice
.

my

the
colonel

"
my
lord
held
out
a
wavering
hand
;
he
seemed
to
wave
a
signal
,
but
whether
it
was
to
give
him
time
or
to
speak
on
,
was
more
than
we
could
guess
.
at
length
he
got
out
the
one
word
,
"
good
?
"
"
why
,
the
very
best
in
the
creation

cries
the
colonel
.
"
for
my
good
friend
and
admired
comrade
is
at
this
hour
in
the
fine
city
of
paris
,

as
like
as
not
,
if
i
know
anything
of
his
habits

will
be

in
his

a
piece
of
dinner

the

"
mrs
henry
was
indeed
the
colour
of
death
,
and
drooped
against
the
window
-
frame
.
but
when
mr
henry
made
a
movement
as
if
to
run
to
her
,
she
straightened
with
a
sort
of
shiver
.
"
i
am
well
,
"
she
said
,
with
her
white
lips
.
mr
henry
stopped
,
and
his
face
had
a
strong
twitch
of
anger
.
the
next
moment
he
had
turned
to
the
colonel
.
"
you
must
not
blame
yourself
,
"
says
he
,
"
for
this
effect
on
mrs
durie
.
it
is
only
natural
;
we
were
all
brought
up
like
brother
and
sister
.
"
mrs
henry
looked
at
her
husband
with
something
like
relief
or
even
gratitude
.
in
my
way
of
thinking
,
that
speech
was
the
first
step
he
made
in
her
good
graces
.
"
you
must
try
to
forgive
me
,
mrs
durie
,
for
indeed
and
i
am
just
an
irish
savage
,
"
said
the
colonel
;
"
and
i
deserve
to
be
shot
for
not
breaking
the
matter
more
artistically
to
a
lady
.
but
here
are
the
master
'
s
own
letters
;
one
for
each
of
the
three
of
you
;
and
to
be
sure
(
if
i
know
anything
of
my
friend
'
s
genius
)
he
will
tell
his
own
story
with
a
better
grace
.
"
he
brought
the
three
letters
forth
as
he
spoke
,
arranged
them
by
their
superscriptions
,
presented
the
first
to
my
lord
,
who
took
it
greedily
,
and
advanced
towards
mrs
henry
holding
out
the
second
.
but
the
lady
waved
it
back
.
"
to
my
husband
,
"
says
she
,
with
a
choked
voice
.
the
colonel
was
a
quick
man
,
but
at
this
he
was
somewhat
nonplussed
.
"
to
be
sure
!
"
says
he
;
"
how
very
dull
of
me
!
to
be
sure
!
"
but
he
still
held
the
letter
.
at
last
mr
henry
reached
forth
his
hand
,
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
give
it
up
.
mr
henry
took
the
letters
(
both
hers
and
his
own
)
,
and
looked
upon
their
outside
,
with
his
brows
knit
hard
,
as
if
he
were
thinking
.
he
had
surprised
me
all
through
by
his
excellent
behaviour
;
but
he
was
to
excel
himself
now
.
"
let
me
give
you
a
hand
to
your
room
,
"
said
he
to
his
wife
.
"
this
has
come
something
of
the
suddenest
;
and
,
at
any
rate
,
you
will
wish
to
read
your
letter
by
yourself
.
"
again
she
looked
upon
him
with
the
same
thought
of
wonder
;
but
he
gave
her
no
time
,
coming
straight
to
where
she
stood
.
"
it
will
be
better
so
,
believe
me
,
"
said
he
;
"
and
colonel
burke
is
too
considerate
not
to
excuse
you
.
"
and
with
that
he
took
her
hand
by
the
fingers
,
and
led
her
from
the
hall
.
mrs
henry
returned
no
more
that
night
;
and
when
mr
henry
went
to
visit
her
next
morning
,
as
i
heard
long
afterwards
,
she
gave
him
the
letter
again
,
still
unopened
.
"
oh
,
read
it
and
be
done
!
"
he
had
cried
.
"
spare
me
that
,
"
said
she
.
and
by
these
two
speeches
,
to
my
way
of
thinking
,
each
undid
a
great
part
of
what
they
had
previously
done
well
.
but
the
letter
,
sure
enough
,
came
into
my
hands
,
and
by
me
was
burned
,
unopened
.
to
be
very
exact
as
to
the
adventures
of
the
master
after
culloden
,
i
wrote
not
long
ago
to
colonel
burke
,
now
a
chevalier
of
the
order
of
st
.
louis
,
begging
him
for
some
notes
in
writing
,
since
i
could
scarce
depend
upon
my
memory
at
so
great
an
interval
.
to
confess
the
truth
,
i
have
been
somewhat
embarrassed
by
his
response
;
for
he
sent
me
the
complete
memoirs
of
his
life
,
touching
only
in
places
on
the
master
;
running
to
a
much
greater
length
than
my
whole
story
,
and
not
everywhere
(
as
it
seems
to
me
)
designed
for
edification
.
he
begged
in
his
letter
,
dated
from
ettenheim
,
that
i
would
find
a
publisher
for
the
whole
,
after
i
had
made
what
use
of
it
i
required
;
and
i
think
i
shall
best
answer
my
own
purpose
and
fulfil
his
wishes
by
printing
certain
parts
of
it
in
full
.
in
this
way
my
readers
will
have
a
detailed
,
and
,
i
believe
,
a
very
genuine
account
of
some
essential
matters
;
and
if
any
publisher
should
take
a
fancy
to
the
chevalier
'
s
manner
of
narration
,
he
knows
where
to
apply
for
the
rest
,
of
which
there
is
plenty
at
his
service
.
i
put
in
my
first
extract
here
,
so
that
it
may
stand
in
the
place
of
what
the
chevalier
told
us
over
our
wine
in
the
hall
of
durrisdeer
;
but
you
are
to
suppose
it
was
not
the
brutal
fact
,
but
a
very
varnished
version
that
he
offered
to
my
lord
.
.
.
.
i
left
ruthven
(
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
remark
)
with
much
greater
satisfaction
than
i
had
come
to
it
;
but
whether
i
missed
my
way
in
the
deserts
,
or
whether
my
companions
failed
me
,
i
soon
found
myself
alone
.
this
was
a
predicament
very
disagreeable
;
for
i
never
understood
this
horrid
country
or
savage
people
,
and
the
last
stroke
of
the
prince
'
s
withdrawal
had
made
us
of
the
irish
more
unpopular
than
ever
.
i
was
reflecting
on
my
poor
chances
,
when
i
saw
another
horseman
on
the
hill
,
whom
i
supposed
at
first
to
have
been
a
phantom
,
the
news
of
his
death
in
the
very
front
at
culloden
being
current
in
the
army
generally
.
this
was
the
master
of
ballantrae
,
my
lord
durrisdeer
'
s
son
,
a
young
nobleman
of
the
rarest
gallantry
and
parts
,
and
equally
designed
by
nature
to
adorn
a
court
and
to
reap
laurels
in
the
field
.
our
meeting
was
the
more
welcome
to
both
,
as
he
was
one
of
the
few
scots
who
had
used
the
irish
with
consideration
,
and
as
he
might
now
be
of
very
high
utility
in
aiding
my
escape
.
yet
what
founded
our
particular
friendship
was
a
circumstance
,
by
itself
as
romantic
as
any
fable
of
king
arthur
.
this
was
on
the
second
day
of
our
flight
,
after
we
had
slept
one
night
in
the
rain
upon
the
inclination
of
a
mountain
.
there
was
an
appin
man
,
alan
black
stewart
(
or
some
such
name
,
but
i
have
seen
him
since
in
france
)
who
chanced
to
be
passing
the
same
way
,
and
had
a
jealousy
of
my
companion
.
very
uncivil
expressions
were
exchanged
;
and
stewart
calls
upon
the
master
to
alight
and
have
it
out
.
"
why
,
mr
stewart
,
"
says
the
master
,
"
i
think
at
the
present
time
i
would
prefer
to
run
a
race
with
you
.
"
and
with
the
word
claps
spurs
to
his
horse
.
stewart
ran
after
us
,
a
childish
thing
to
do
,
for
more
than
a
mile
;
and
i
could
not
help
laughing
,
as
i
looked
back
at
last
and
saw
him
on
a
hill
,
holding
his
hand
to
his
side
,
and
nearly
burst
with
running
.
"
but
,
all
the
same
,
"
i
could
not
help
saying
to
my
companion
,
"
i
would
let
no
man
run
after
me
for
any
such
proper
purpose
,
and
not
give
him
his
desire
.
it
was
a
good
jest
,
but
it
smells
a
trifle
cowardly
.
"
he
bent
his
brows
at
me
.
"
i
do
pretty
well
,
"
says
he
,
"
when
i
saddle
myself
with
the
most
unpopular
man
in
scotland
,
and
let
that
suffice
for
courage
.
"
"
o
,
bedad
,
"
says
i
,
"
i
could
show
you
a
more
unpopular
with
the
naked
eye
.
and
if
you
like
not
my
company
,
you
can
'
saddle
'
yourself
on
some
one
else
.
"
"
colonel
burke
,
"
says
he
,
"
do
not
let
us
quarrel
;
and
,
to
that
effect
,
let
me
assure
you
i
am
the
least
patient
man
in
the
world
.
"
"
i
am
as
little
patient
as
yourself

"
said
i
.
"
i
care
not
who
knows
that
.
"
"
at
this
rate
,
"
says
he
,
reining
in
,
"
we
shall
not
go
very
far
.
and
i
propose
we
do
one
of
two
things
upon
the
instant
:
either
quarrel
and
be
done
;
or
make
a
sure
bargain
to
bear
everything
at
each
other
'
s
hands
.
"
"
like
a
pair
of
brothers
?
"
said
i
.
"
i
said
no
such
foolishness
,
"
he
replied
.
"
i
have
a
brother
of
my
own
,
and
i
think
no
more
of
him
than
of
a
colewort
.
but
if
we
are
to
have
our
noses
rubbed
together
in
this
course
of
flight
,
let
us
each
dare
to
be
ourselves
like
savages
,
and
each
swear
that
he
will
neither
resent
nor
deprecate
the
other
.
i
am
a
pretty
bad
fellow
at
bottom
,
and
i
find
the
pretence
of
virtues
very
irksome
.
"
"
o
,
i
am
as
bad
as
yourself

"
said
i
.
"
there
is
no
skim
milk
in
francis
burke
.

which
is
it
to
be
?
fight
or
make
friends
?
"
"
why
,
"
says
be
,
"
i
think
it
will
be
the
best
manner
to
spin
a
coin
for
it
.
"
this
proposition
was
too
highly
chivalrous
not
to
take
my
fancy
;
and
,
strange
as
it
may
seem
of
two
well
-
born
gentlemen
of
to
-
day
,
we
span
a
half
-
crown
(
like
a
pair
of
ancient
paladins
)
whether
we
were
to
cut
each
other
'
s
throats
or
be
sworn
friends
.
a
more
romantic
circumstance
can
rarely
have
occurred
;
and
it
is
one
of
those
points
in
my
memoirs
,
by
which
we
may
see
the
old
tales
of
homer
and
the
poets
are
equally
true
to
-
day
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
at
least
,
of
the
noble
and
genteel
.
the
coin
fell
for
peace
,
and
we
shook
hands
upon
our
bargain
.
and
then
it
was
that
my
companion
explained
to
me
his
thought
in
running
away
from
mr
stewart
,
which
was
certainly
worthy
of
his
political
intellect
.
the
report
of
his
death
,
he
said
,
was
a
great
guard
to
him
;
mr
stewart
having
recognised
him
,
had
become
a
danger
;
and
he
had
taken
the
briefest
road
to
that
gentleman
'
s
silence
.
"
for
,
"
says
he
,
"
alan
black
is
too
vain
a
man
to
narrate
any
such
story
of
himself
.
"
towards
afternoon
we
came
down
to
the
shores
of
that
loch
for
which
we
were
heading
;
and
there
was
the
ship
,
but
newly
come
to
anchor
.
she
was
the
sainte
-
marie
-
des
-
anges
,
out
of
the
port
of
havre
-
de
-
grace
.
the
master
,
after
we
had
signalled
for
a
boat
,
asked
me
if
i
knew
the
captain
.
i
told
him
he
was
a
countryman
of
mine
,
of
the
most
unblemished
integrity
,
but
,
i
was
afraid
,
a
rather
timorous
man
.
"
no
matter
,
"
says
he
.
"
for
all
that
,
he
should
certainly
hear
the
truth
.
"
i
asked
him
if
he
meant
about
the
battle
?
for
if
the
captain
once
knew
the
standard
was
down
,
he
would
certainly
put
to
sea
again
at
once
.
"
and
even
then
!
"
said
he
;
"
the
arms
are
now
of
no
sort
of
utility
.
"
"
my
dear
man
,
"
said
i
,
"
who
thinks
of
the
arms
?
but
,
to
be
sure
,
we
must
remember
our
friends
.
they
will
be
close
upon
our
heels
,
perhaps
the
prince
himself
,
and
if
the
ship
be
gone
,
a
great
number
of
valuable
lives
may
be
imperilled
.
"
"
the
captain
and
the
crew
have
lives
also
,
if
you
come
to
that
,
"
says
ballantrae
.
this
i
declared
was
but
a
quibble
,
and
that
i
would
not
hear
of
the
captain
being
told
;
and
then
it
was
that
ballantrae
made
me
a
witty
answer
,
for
the
sake
of
which
(
and
also
because
i
have
been
blamed
myself
in
this
business
of
the
sainte
-
marie
-
des
-
anges
)
i
have
related
the
whole
conversation
as
it
passed
.
"
frank
,
"
says
he
,
"
remember
our
bargain
.
i
must
not
object
to
your
holding
your
tongue
,
which
i
hereby
even
encourage
you
to
do
;
but
,
by
the
same
terms
,
you
are
not
to
resent
my
telling
.
"
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
this
;
though
i
still
forewarned
him
what
would
come
of
it
.
"
the
devil
may
come
of
it
for
what
i
care
,
"
says
the
reckless
fellow
.
"
i
have
always
done
exactly
as
i
felt
inclined
.
"
as
is
well
known
,
my
prediction
came
true
.
the
captain
had
no
sooner
heard
the
news
than
he
cut
his
cable
and
to
sea
again
;
and
before
morning
broke
,
we
were
in
the
great
minch
.
the
ship
was
very
old
;
and
the
skipper
,
although
the
most
honest
of
men
(
and
irish
too
)
,
was
one
of
the
least
capable
.
the
wind
blew
very
boisterous
,
and
the
sea
raged
extremely
.
all
that
day
we
had
little
heart
whether
to
eat
or
drink
;
went
early
to
rest
in
some
concern
of
mind
;
and
(
as
if
to
give
us
a
lesson
)
in
the
night
the
wind
chopped
suddenly
into
the
north
-
east
,
and
blew
a
hurricane
.
we
were
awaked
by
the
dreadful
thunder
of
the
tempest
and
the
stamping
of
the
mariners
on
deck
;
so
that
i
supposed
our
last
hour
was
certainly
come
;
and
the
terror
of
my
mind
was
increased
out
of
all
measure
by
ballantrae
,
who
mocked
at
my
devotions
.
it
is
in
hours
like
these
that
a
man
of
any
piety
appears
in
his
true
light
,
and
we
find
(
what
we
are
taught
as
babes
)
the
small
trust
that
can
be
set
in
worldly
friends
.
i
would
be
unworthy
of
my
religion
if
i
let
this
pass
without
particular
remark
.
for
three
days
we
lay
in
the
dark
in
the
cabin
,
and
had
but
a
biscuit
to
nibble
.
on
the
fourth
the
wind
fell
,
leaving
the
ship
dismasted
and
heaving
on
vast
billows
.
the
captain
had
not
a
guess
of
whither
we
were
blown
;
he
was
stark
ignorant
of
his
trade
,
and
could
do
naught
but
bless
the
holy
virgin
;
a
very
good
thing
,
too
,
but
scarce
the
whole
of
seamanship
.
it
seemed
,
our
one
hope
was
to
be
picked
up
by
another
vessel
;
and
if
that
should
prove
to
be
an
english
ship
,
it
might
be
no
great
blessing
to
the
master
and
myself
.
the
fifth
and
sixth
days
we
tossed
there
helpless
.
the
seventh
some
sail
was
got
on
her
,
but
she
was
an
unwieldy
vessel
at
the
best
,
and
we
made
little
but
leeway
.
all
the
time
,
indeed
,
we
had
been
drifting
to
the
south
and
west
,
and
during
the
tempest
must
have
driven
in
that
direction
with
unheard
-
of
violence
.
the
ninth
dawn
was
cold
and
black
,
with
a
great
sea
running
,
and
every
mark
of
foul
weather
.
in
this
situation
we
were
overjoyed
to
sight
a
small
ship
on
the
horizon
,
and
to
perceive
her
go
about
and
head
for
the
sainte
-
marie
.
but
our
gratification
did
not
very
long
endure
;
for
when
she
had
laid
to
and
lowered
a
boat
,
it
was
immediately
filled
with
disorderly
fellows
,
who
sang
and
shouted
as
they
pulled
across
to
us
,
and
swarmed
in
on
our
deck
with
bare
cutlasses
,
cursing
loudly
.
their
leader
was
a
horrible
villain
,
with
his
face
blacked
and
his
whiskers
curled
in
ringlets
;
teach
,
his
name
;
a
most
notorious
pirate
.
he
stamped
about
the
deck
,
raving
and
crying
out
that
his
name
was
satan
,
and
his
ship
was
called
hell
.
there
was
something
about
him
like
a
wicked
child
or
a
half
-
witted
person
,
that
daunted
me
beyond
expression
.
i
whispered
in
the
ear
of
ballantrae
that
i
would
not
be
the
last
to
volunteer
,
and
only
prayed
god
they
might
be
short
of
hands
;
he
approved
my
purpose
with
a
nod
.
"
bedad
,
"
said
i
to
master
teach
,
"
if
you
are
satan
,
here
is
a
devil
for
ye
.
"
the
word
pleased
him
;
and
(
not
to
dwell
upon
these
shocking
incidents
)
ballantrae
and
i
and
two
others
were
taken
for
recruits
,
while
the
skipper
and
all
the
rest
were
cast
into
the
sea
by
the
method
of
walking
the
plank
.
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
this
done
;
my
heart
died
within
me
at
the
spectacle
;
and
master
teach
or
one
of
his
acolytes
(
for
my
head
was
too
much
lost
to
be
precise
)
remarked
upon
my
pale
face
in
a
very
alarming
manner
.
i
had
the
strength
to
cut
a
step
or
two
of
a
jig
,
and
cry
out
some
ribaldry
,
which
saved
me
for
that
time
;
but
my
legs
were
like
water
when
i
must
get
down
into
the
skiff
among
these
miscreants
;
and
what
with
my
horror
of
my
company
and
fear
of
the
monstrous
billows
,
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
an
irish
tongue
and
break
a
jest
or
two
as
we
were
pulled
aboard
.
by
the
blessing
of
god
,
there
was
a
fiddle
in
the
pirate
ship
,
which
i
had
no
sooner
seen
than
i
fell
upon
;
and
in
my
quality
of
crowder
i
had
the
heavenly
good
luck
to
get
favour
in
their
eyes
.
crowding
pat
was
the
name
they
dubbed
me
with
;
and
it
was
little
i
cared
for
a
name
so
long
as
my
skin
was
whole
.
what
kind
of
a
pandemonium
that
vessel
was
,
i
cannot
describe
,
but
she
was
commanded
by
a
lunatic
,
and
might
be
called
a
floating
bedlam
.
drinking
,
roaring
,
singing
,
quarrelling
,
dancing
,
they
were
never
all
sober
at
one
time
;
and
there
were
days
together
when
,
if
a
squall
had
supervened
,
it
must
have
sent
us
to
the
bottom
;
or
if
a
king
'
s
ship
had
come
along
,
it
would
have
found
us
quite
helpless
for
defence
.
once
or
twice
we
sighted
a
sail
,
and
,
if
we
were
sober
enough
,
overhauled
it
,
god
forgive
us
!
and
if
we
were
all
too
drunk
,
she
got
away
,
and
i
would
bless
the
saints
under
my
breath
.
teach
ruled
,
if
you
can
call
that
rule
which
brought
no
order
,
by
the
terror
he
created
;
and
i
observed
the
man
was
very
vain
of
his
position
.
i
have
known
marshals
of
france
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
ay
,
and
even
highland
chieftains
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
were
less
openly
puffed
up
;
which
throws
a
singular
light
on
the
pursuit
of
honour
and
glory
.
indeed
,
the
longer
we
live
,
the
more
we
perceive
the
sagacity
of
aristotle
and
the
other
old
philosophers
;
and
though
i
have
all
my
life
been
eager
for
legitimate
distinctions
,
i
can
lay
my
hand
upon
my
heart
,
at
the
end
of
my
career
,
and
declare
there
is
not
one
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
no
,
nor
yet
life
itself
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
which
is
worth
acquiring
or
preserving
at
the
slightest
cost
of
dignity
.
it
was
long
before
i
got
private
speech
of
ballantrae
;
but
at
length
one
night
we
crept
out
upon
the
boltsprit
,
when
the
rest
were
better
employed
,
and
commiserated
our
position
.
"
none
can
deliver
us
but
the
saints
,
"
said
i
.
"
my
mind
is
very
different
,
"
said
ballantrae
;
"
for
i
am
going
to
deliver
myself
.
this
teach
is
the
poorest
creature
possible
;
we
make
no
profit
of
him
,
and
lie
continually
open
to
capture
;
and
,
"
says
he
,
"
i
am
not
going
to
be
a
tarry
pirate
for
nothing
,
nor
yet
to
hang
in
chains
if
i
can
help
it
.
"
and
he
told
me
what
was
in
his
mind
to
better
the
state
of
the
ship
in
the
way
of
discipline
,
which
would
give
us
safety
for
the
present
,
and
a
sooner
hope
of
deliverance
when
they
should
have
gained
enough
and
should
break
up
their
company
.
i
confessed
to
him
ingenuously
that
my
nerve
was
quite
shook
amid
these
horrible
surroundings
,
and
i
durst
scarce
tell
him
to
count
upon
me
.
"
i
am
not
very
easy
frightened
,
"
said
he
,
"
nor
very
easy
beat
.
"
a
few
days
after
,
there
befell
an
accident
which
had
nearly
hanged
us
all
;
and
offers
the
most
extraordinary
picture
of
the
folly
that
ruled
in
our
concerns
.
we
were
all
pretty
drunk
:
and
some
bedlamite
spying
a
sail
,
teach
put
the
ship
about
in
chase
without
a
glance
,
and
we
began
to
bustle
up
the
arms
and
boast
of
the
horrors
that
should
follow
.
i
observed
ballantrae
stood
quiet
in
the
bows
,
looking
under
the
shade
of
his
hand
;
but
for
my
part
,
true
to
my
policy
among
these
savages
,
i
was
at
work
with
the
busiest
and
passing
irish
jests
for
their
diversion
.
"
run
up
the
colours
,
"
cries
teach
.
"
show
the
-
s
the
jolly
roger
!
"
it
was
the
merest
drunken
braggadocio
at
such
a
stage
,
and
might
have
lost
us
a
valuable
prize
;
but
i
thought
it
no
part
of
mine
to
reason
,
and
i
ran
up
the
black
flag
with
my
own
hand
.
ballantrae
steps
presently
aft
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
.
"
you
may
perhaps
like
to
know
,
you
drunken
dog
,
"
says
he
,
"
that
you
are
chasing
a
king
'
s
ship
.
"
teach
roared
him
the
lie
;
but
he
ran
at
the
same
time
to
the
bulwarks
,
and
so
did
they
all
.
i
have
never
seen
so
many
drunken
men
struck
suddenly
sober
.
the
cruiser
had
gone
about
,
upon
our
impudent
display
of
colours
;
she
was
just
then
filling
on
the
new
tack
;
her
ensign
blew
out
quite
plain
to
see
;
and
even
as
we
stared
,
there
came
a
puff
of
smoke
,
and
then
a
report
,
and
a
shot
plunged
in
the
waves
a
good
way
short
of
us
.
some
ran
to
the
ropes
,
and
got
the
sarah
round
with
an
incredible
swiftness
.
one
fellow
fell
on
the
rum
barrel
,
which
stood
broached
upon
the
deck
,
and
rolled
it
promptly
overboard
.
on
my
part
,
i
made
for
the
jolly
roger
,
struck
it
,
tossed
it
in
the
sea
;
and
could
have
flung
myself
after
,
so
vexed
was
i
with
our
mismanagement
.
as
for
teach
,
he
grew
as
pale
as
death
,
and
incontinently
went
down
to
his
cabin
.
only
twice
he
came
on
deck
that
afternoon
;
went
to
the
taffrail
;
took
a
long
look
at
the
king
'
s
ship
,
which
was
still
on
the
horizon
heading
after
us
;
and
then
,
without
speech
,
back
to
his
cabin
.
you
may
say
he
deserted
us
;
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
one
very
capable
sailor
we
had
on
board
,
and
for
the
lightness
of
the
airs
that
blew
all
day
,
we
must
certainly
have
gone
to
the
yard
-
arm
.
it
is
to
be
supposed
teach
was
humiliated
,
and
perhaps
alarmed
for
his
position
with
the
crew
;
and
the
way
in
which
he
set
about
regaining
what
he
had
lost
,
was
highly
characteristic
of
the
man
.
early
next
day
we
smelled
him
burning
sulphur
in
his
cabin
and
crying
out
of
"
hell
,
hell
!
"
which
was
well
understood
among
the
crew
,
and
filled
their
minds
with
apprehension
.
presently
he
comes
on
deck
,
a
perfect
figure
of
fun
,
his
face
blacked
,
his
hair
and
whiskers
curled
,
his
belt
stuck
full
of
pistols
;
chewing
bits
of
glass
so
that
the
blood
ran
down
his
chin
,
and
brandishing
a
dirk
.
i
do
not
know
if
he
had
taken
these
manners
from
the
indians
of
america
,
where
he
was
a
native
;
but
such
was
his
way
,
and
he
would
always
thus
announce
that
he
was
wound
up
to
horrid
deeds
.
the
first
that
came
near
him
was
the
fellow
who
had
sent
the
rum
overboard
the
day
before
;
him
he
stabbed
to
the
heart
,
damning
him
for
a
mutineer
;
and
then
capered
about
the
body
,
raving
and
swearing
and
daring
us
to
come
on
.
it
was
the
silliest
exhibition
;
and
yet
dangerous
too
,
for
the
cowardly
fellow
was
plainly
working
himself
up
to
another
murder
.
all
of
a
sudden
ballantrae
stepped
forth
.
"
have
done
with
this
play
-
acting
,
"
says
he
.
"
do
you
think
to
frighten
us
with
making
faces
?
we
saw
nothing
of
you
yesterday
,
when
you
were
wanted
;
and
we
did
well
without
you
,
let
me
tell
you
that
.
"
there
was
a
murmur
and
a
movement
in
the
crew
,
of
pleasure
and
alarm
,
i
thought
,
in
nearly
equal
parts
.
as
for
teach
,
he
gave
a
barbarous
howl
,
and
swung
his
dirk
to
fling
it
,
an
art
in
which
(
like
many
seamen
)
he
was
very
expert
.
"
knock
that
out
of
his
hand
!
"
says
ballantrae
,
so
sudden
and
sharp
that
my
arm
obeyed
him
before
my
mind
had
understood
.
teach
stood
like
one
stupid
,
never
thinking
on
his
pistols
.
"
go
down
to
your
cabin
,
"
cries
ballantrae
,
"
and
come
on
deck
again
when
you
are
sober
.
do
you
think
we
are
going
to
hang
for
you
,
you
black
-
faced
,
half
-
witted
,
drunken
brute
and
butcher
?
go
down
!
"
and
he
stamped
his
foot
at
him
with
such
a
sudden
smartness
that
teach
fairly
ran
for
it
to
the
companion
.
"
and
now
,
mates
,
"
says
ballantrae
,
"
a
word
with
you
.
i
do
not
know
if
you
are
gentlemen
of
fortune
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
,
but
i
am
not
.
i
want
to
make
money
,
and
get
ashore
again
,
and
spend
it
like
a
man
.
and
on
one
thing
my
mind
is
made
up
:
i
will
not
hang
if
i
can
help
it
.
come
:
give
me
a
hint
;
i
am
only
a
beginner
!
is
there
no
way
to
get
a
little
discipline
and
common
sense
about
this
business
?
"
one
of
the
men
spoke
up
:
he
said
by
rights
they
should
have
a
quartermaster
;
and
no
sooner
was
the
word
out
of
his
mouth
than
they
were
all
of
that
opinion
.
the
thing
went
by
acclamation
,
ballantrae
was
made
quartermaster
,
the
rum
was
put
in
his
charge
,
laws
were
passed
in
imitation
of
those
of
a
pirate
by
the
name
of
roberts
,
and
the
last
proposal
was
to
make
an
end
of
teach
.
but
ballantrae
was
afraid
of
a
more
efficient
captain
,
who
might
be
a
counterweight
to
himself
,
and
he
opposed
this
stoutly
.
teach
,
he
said
,
was
good
enough
to
board
ships
and
frighten
fools
with
his
blacked
face
and
swearing
;
we
could
scarce
get
a
better
man
than
teach
for
that
;
and
besides
,
as
the
man
was
now
disconsidered
and
as
good
as
deposed
,
we
might
reduce
his
proportion
of
the
plunder
.
this
carried
it
;
teach
'
s
share
was
cut
down
to
a
mere
derision
,
being
actually
less
than
mine
;
and
there
remained
only
two
points
:
whether
he
would
consent
,
and
who
was
to
announce
to
him
this
resolution
.
"
do
not
let
that
stick
you
,
"
says
ballantrae
,
"
i
will
do
that
.
"
and
he
stepped
to
the
companion
and
down
alone
into
the
cabin
to
face
that
drunken
savage
.
"
this
is
the
man
for
us
,
"
cries
one
of
the
hands
.
"
three
cheers
for
the
quartermaster
!
"
which
were
given
with
a
will
,
my
own
voice
among
the
loudest
,
and
i
dare
say
these
plaudits
had
their
effect
on
master
teach
in
the
cabin
,
as
we
have
seen
of
late
days
how
shouting
in
the
streets
may
trouble
even
the
minds
of
legislators
.
what
passed
precisely
was
never
known
,
though
some
of
the
heads
of
it
came
to
the
surface
later
on
;
and
we
were
all
amazed
,
as
well
as
gratified
,
when
ballantrae
came
on
deck
with
teach
upon
his
arm
,
and
announced
that
all
had
been
consented
.
i
pass
swiftly
over
those
twelve
or
fifteen
months
in
which
we
continued
to
keep
the
sea
in
the
north
atlantic
,
getting
our
food
and
water
from
the
ships
we
over
-
hauled
,
and
doing
on
the
whole
a
pretty
fortunate
business
.
sure
,
no
one
could
wish
to
read
anything
so
ungenteel
as
the
memoirs
of
a
pirate
,
even
an
unwilling
one
like
me
!
things
went
extremely
better
with
our
designs
,
and
ballantrae
kept
his
lead
,
to
my
admiration
,
from
that
day
forth
.
i
would
be
tempted
to
suppose
that
a
gentleman
must
everywhere
be
first
,
even
aboard
a
rover
:
but
my
birth
is
every
whit
as
good
as
any
scottish
lord
'
s
,
and
i
am
not
ashamed
to
confess
that
i
stayed
crowding
pat
until
the
end
,
and
was
not
much
better
than
the
crew
'
s
buffoon
.
indeed
,
it
was
no
scene
to
bring
out
my
merits
.
my
health
suffered
from
a
variety
of
reasons
;
i
was
more
at
home
to
the
last
on
a
horse
'
s
back
than
a
ship
'
s
deck
;
and
,
to
be
ingenuous
,
the
fear
of
the
sea
was
constantly
in
my
mind
,
battling
with
the
fear
of
my
companions
.
i
need
not
cry
myself
up
for
courage
;
i
have
done
well
on
many
fields
under
the
eyes
of
famous
generals
,
and
earned
my
late
advancement
by
an
act
of
the
most
distinguished
valour
before
many
witnesses
.
but
when
we
must
proceed
on
one
of
our
abordages
,
the
heart
of
francis
burke
was
in
his
boots
;
the
little
eggshell
skiff
in
which
we
must
set
forth
,
the
horrible
heaving
of
the
vast
billows
,
the
height
of
the
ship
that
we
must
scale
,
the
thought
of
how
many
might
be
there
in
garrison
upon
their
legitimate
defence
,
the
scowling
heavens
which
(
in
that
climate
)
so
often
looked
darkly
down
upon
our
exploits
,
and
the
mere
crying
of
the
wind
in
my
ears
,
were
all
considerations
most
unpalatable
to
my
valour
.
besides
which
,
as
i
was
always
a
creature
of
the
nicest
sensibility
,
the
scenes
that
must
follow
on
our
success
tempted
me
as
little
as
the
chances
of
defeat
.
twice
we
found
women
on
board
;
and
though
i
have
seen
towns
sacked
,
and
of
late
days
in
france
some
very
horrid
public
tumults
,
there
was
something
in
the
smallness
of
the
numbers
engaged
,
and
the
bleak
dangerous
sea
-
surroundings
,
that
made
these
acts
of
piracy
far
the
most
revolting
.
i
confess
ingenuously
i
could
never
proceed
unless
i
was
three
parts
drunk
;
it
was
the
same
even
with
the
crew
;
teach
himself
was
fit
for
no
enterprise
till
he
was
full
of
rum
;
and
it
was
one
