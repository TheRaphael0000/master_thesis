harold
march
and
the
few
who
cultivated
the
friendship
of
horne
fisher
especially
if
they
saw
something
of
him
in
his
own
social
setting
were
conscious
of
a
certain
solitude
in
his
very
sociability
they
seemed
to
be
always
meeting
his
relations
and
never
meeting
his
family
perhaps
it
would
be
truer
to
say
that
they
saw
much
of
his
family
and
nothing
of
his
home
his
cousins
and
connections
ramified
like
a
labyrinth
all
over
the
governing
class
of
great
britain
and
he
seemed
to
be
on
good
or
at
least
on
good
-
humored
terms
with
most
of
them
for
horne
fisher
was
remarkable
for
a
curious
impersonal
information
and
interest
touching
all
sorts
of
topics
so
that
one
could
sometimes
fancy
that
his
culture
like
his
colorless
fair
mustache
and
pale
drooping
features
had
the
neutral
nature
of
a
chameleon
anyhow
he
could
always
get
on
with
viceroys
and
cabinet
ministers
and
all
the
great
men
responsible
for
great
departments
and
talk
to
each
of
them
on
his
own
subject
on
the
branch
of
study
with
which
he
was
most
seriously
concerned
thus
he
could
converse
with
the
minister
for
war
about
silkworms
with
the
minister
of
education
about
detective
stories
with
the
minister
of
labor
about
limoges
enamel
and
with
the
minister
of
missions
and
moral
progress
(
if
that
be
his
correct
title
)
about
the
pantomime
boys
of
the
last
four
decades
and
as
the
first
was
his
first
cousin
the
second
his
second
cousin
the
third
his
brother
-
in
-
law
and
the
fourth
his
uncle
by
marriage
this
conversational
versatility
certainly
served
in
one
sense
to
create
a
happy
family
but
march
never
seemed
to
get
a
glimpse
of
that
domestic
interior
to
which
men
of
the
middle
classes
are
accustomed
in
their
friendships
and
which
is
indeed
the
foundation
of
friendship
and
love
and
everything
else
in
any
sane
and
stable
society
he
wondered
whether
horne
fisher
was
both
an
orphan
and
an
only
child
it
was
therefore
with
something
like
a
start
that
he
found
that
fisher
had
a
brother
much
more
prosperous
and
powerful
than
himself
though
hardly
march
thought
so
entertaining
sir
henry
harland
fisher
with
half
the
alphabet
after
his
name
was
something
at
the
foreign
office
far
more
tremendous
than
the
foreign
secretary
apparently
it
ran
in
the
family
after
all
for
it
seemed
there
was
another
brother
ashton
fisher
in
india
rather
more
tremendous
than
the
viceroy
sir
henry
fisher
was
a
heavier
but
handsomer
edition
of
his
brother
with
a
brow
equally
bald
but
much
more
smooth
he
was
very
courteous
but
a
shade
patronizing
not
only
to
march
but
even
as
march
fancied
to
horne
fisher
as
well
the
latter
gentleman
who
had
many
intuitions
about
the
half
-
formed
thoughts
of
others
glanced
at
the
topic
himself
as
they
came
away
from
the
great
house
in
berkeley
square
why
do
not
you
know
he
observed
quietly
that
i
am
the
fool
of
the
family
it
must
be
a
clever
family
said
harold
march
with
a
smile
very
gracefully
expressed
replied
fisher
that
is
the
best
of
having
a
literary
training
well
perhaps
it
is
an
exaggeration
to
say
i
am
the
fool
of
the
family
it
is
enough
to
say
i
am
the
failure
of
the
family
it
seems
queer
to
me
that
you
should
fail
especially
remarked
the
journalist
as
they
say
in
the
examinations
what
did
you
fail
in
politics
replied
his
friend
i
stood
for
parliament
when
i
was
quite
a
young
man
and
got
in
by
an
enormous
majority
with
loud
cheers
and
chairing
round
the
town
since
then
of
course
i
'
ve
been
rather
under
a
cloud
i
am
afraid
i
do
not
quite
understand
the
of
course
answered
march
laughing
that
part
of
it
is
not
worth
understanding
said
fisher
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
old
chap
the
other
part
of
it
was
rather
odd
and
interesting
quite
a
detective
story
in
its
way
as
well
as
the
first
lesson
i
had
in
what
modern
politics
are
made
of
if
you
like
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
and
the
following
recast
in
a
less
allusive
and
conversational
manner
is
the
story
that
he
told
nobody
privileged
of
late
years
to
meet
sir
henry
harland
fisher
would
believe
that
he
had
ever
been
called
harry
but
indeed
he
had
been
boyish
enough
when
a
boy
and
that
serenity
which
shone
on
him
through
life
and
which
now
took
the
form
of
gravity
had
once
taken
the
form
of
gayety
his
friends
would
have
said
that
he
was
all
the
more
ripe
in
his
maturity
for
having
been
young
in
his
youth
his
enemies
would
have
said
that
he
was
still
light
minded
but
no
longer
light
hearted
but
in
any
case
the
whole
of
the
story
horne
fisher
had
to
tell
arose
out
of
the
accident
which
had
made
young
harry
fisher
private
secretary
to
lord
saltoun
hence
his
later
connection
with
the
foreign
office
which
had
indeed
come
to
him
as
a
sort
of
legacy
from
his
lordship
when
that
great
man
was
the
power
behind
the
throne
this
is
not
the
place
to
say
much
about
saltoun
little
as
was
known
of
him
and
much
as
there
was
worth
knowing
england
has
had
at
least
three
or
four
such
secret
statesmen
an
aristocratic
polity
produces
every
now
and
then
an
aristocrat
who
is
also
an
accident
a
man
of
intellectual
independence
and
insight
a
napoleon
born
in
the
purple
his
vast
work
was
mostly
invisible
and
very
little
could
be
got
out
of
him
in
private
life
except
a
crusty
and
rather
cynical
sense
of
humor
but
it
was
certainly
the
accident
of
his
presence
at
a
family
dinner
of
the
fishers
and
the
unexpected
opinion
he
expressed
which
turned
what
might
have
been
a
dinner
-
table
joke
into
a
sort
of
small
sensational
novel
save
for
lord
saltoun
it
was
a
family
party
of
fishers
for
the
only
other
distinguished
stranger
had
just
departed
after
dinner
leaving
the
rest
to
their
coffee
and
cigars
this
had
been
a
figure
of
some
interest
a
young
cambridge
man
named
eric
hughes
who
was
the
rising
hope
of
the
party
of
reform
to
which
the
fisher
family
along
with
their
friend
saltoun
had
long
been
at
least
formally
attached
the
personality
of
hughes
was
substantially
summed
up
in
the
fact
that
he
talked
eloquently
and
earnestly
through
the
whole
dinner
but
left
immediately
after
to
be
in
time
for
an
appointment
all
his
actions
had
something
at
once
ambitious
and
conscientious
he
drank
no
wine
but
was
slightly
intoxicated
with
words
and
his
face
and
phrases
were
on
the
front
page
of
all
the
newspapers
just
then
because
he
was
contesting
the
safe
seat
of
sir
francis
verner
in
the
great
by
-
election
in
the
west
everybody
was
talking
about
the
powerful
speech
against
squirarchy
which
he
had
just
delivered
even
in
the
fisher
circle
everybody
talked
about
it
except
horne
fisher
himself
who
sat
in
a
corner
lowering
over
the
fire
we
jolly
well
have
to
thank
him
for
putting
some
new
life
into
the
old
party
ashton
fisher
was
saying
this
campaign
against
the
old
squires
just
hits
the
degree
of
democracy
there
is
in
this
county
this
act
for
extending
county
council
control
is
practically
his
bill
so
you
may
say
he
is
in
the
government
even
before
he
is
in
the
house
one
'
s
easier
than
the
other
said
harry
carelessly
i
bet
the
squire
'
s
a
bigger
pot
than
the
county
council
in
that
county
verner
is
pretty
well
rooted
all
these
rural
places
are
what
you
call
reactionary
damning
aristocrats
wo
not
alter
it
he
damns
them
rather
well
observed
ashton
we
never
had
a
better
meeting
than
the
one
in
barkington
which
generally
goes
constitutional
and
when
he
said
'
sir
francis
may
boast
of
blue
blood
let
us
show
we
have
red
blood
'
and
went
on
to
talk
about
manhood
and
liberty
the
room
simply
rose
at
him
speaks
very
well
said
lord
saltoun
gruffly
making
his
only
contribution
to
the
conversation
so
far
then
the
almost
equally
silent
horne
fisher
suddenly
spoke
without
taking
his
brooding
eyes
off
the
fire
what
i
ca
not
understand
he
said
is
why
nobody
is
ever
slanged
for
the
real
reason
hullo
remarked
harry
humorously
you
beginning
to
take
notice
well
take
verner
continued
horne
fisher
if
we
want
to
attack
verner
why
not
attack
him
why
compliment
him
on
being
a
romantic
reactionary
aristocrat
who
is
verner
where
does
he
come
from
his
name
sounds
old
but
i
never
heard
of
it
before
as
the
man
said
of
the
crucifixion
why
talk
about
his
blue
blood
his
blood
may
be
gamboge
yellow
with
green
spots
for
all
anybody
knows
all
we
know
is
that
the
old
squire
hawker
somehow
ran
through
his
money
(
and
his
second
wife
'
s
i
suppose
for
she
was
rich
enough
)
and
sold
the
estate
to
a
man
named
verner
what
did
he
make
his
money
in
oil
army
contracts
i
do
not
know
said
saltoun
looking
at
him
thoughtfully
first
thing
i
ever
knew
you
did
not
know
cried
the
exuberant
harry
and
there
'
s
more
besides
went
on
horne
fisher
who
seemed
to
have
suddenly
found
his
tongue
if
we
want
country
people
to
vote
for
us
why
do
not
we
get
somebody
with
some
notion
about
the
country
we
do
not
talk
to
people
in
threadneedle
street
about
nothing
but
turnips
and
pigsties
why
do
we
talk
to
people
in
somerset
about
nothing
but
slums
and
socialism
why
do
not
we
give
the
squire
'
s
land
to
the
squire
'
s
tenants
instead
of
dragging
in
the
county
council
three
acres
and
a
cow
cried
harry
emitting
what
the
parliamentary
reports
call
an
ironical
cheer
yes
replied
his
brother
stubbornly
do
not
you
think
agricultural
laborers
would
rather
have
three
acres
and
a
cow
than
three
acres
of
printed
forms
and
a
committee
why
does
not
somebody
start
a
yeoman
party
in
politics
appealing
to
the
old
traditions
of
the
small
landowner
and
why
do
not
they
attack
men
like
verner
for
what
they
are
which
is
something
about
as
old
and
traditional
as
an
american
oil
trust
you
'
d
better
lead
the
yeoman
party
yourself
laughed
harry
do
not
you
think
it
would
be
a
joke
lord
saltoun
to
see
my
brother
and
his
merry
men
with
their
bows
and
bills
marching
down
to
somerset
all
in
lincoln
green
instead
of
lincoln
and
bennet
hats
no
answered
old
saltoun
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
a
joke
i
think
it
would
be
an
exceedingly
serious
and
sensible
idea
well
i
am
jiggered
cried
harry
fisher
staring
at
him
i
said
just
now
it
was
the
first
fact
you
did
not
know
and
i
should
say
this
is
the
first
joke
you
did
not
see
i
'
ve
seen
a
good
many
things
in
my
time
said
the
old
man
in
his
rather
sour
fashion
i
'
ve
told
a
good
many
lies
in
my
time
too
and
perhaps
i
'
ve
got
rather
sick
of
them
but
there
are
lies
and
lies
for
all
that
gentlemen
used
to
lie
just
as
schoolboys
lie
because
they
hung
together
and
partly
to
help
one
another
out
but
i
am
damned
if
i
can
see
why
we
should
lie
for
these
cosmopolitan
cads
who
only
help
themselves
they
are
not
backing
us
up
any
more
they
are
simply
crowding
us
out
if
a
man
like
your
brother
likes
to
go
into
parliament
as
a
yeoman
or
a
gentleman
or
a
jacobite
or
an
ancient
briton
i
should
say
it
would
be
a
jolly
good
thing
in
the
rather
startled
silence
that
followed
horne
fisher
sprang
to
his
feet
and
all
his
dreary
manner
dropped
off
him
i
am
ready
to
do
it
to
-
morrow
he
cried
i
suppose
none
of
you
fellows
would
back
me
up
then
harry
fisher
showed
the
finer
side
of
his
impetuosity
he
made
a
sudden
movement
as
if
to
shake
hands
you
are
a
sport
he
said
and
i
will
back
you
up
if
nobody
else
will
but
we
can
all
back
you
up
ca
not
we
i
see
what
lord
saltoun
means
and
of
course
he
is
right
he
is
always
right
so
i
will
go
down
to
somerset
said
horne
fisher
yes
it
is
on
the
way
to
westminster
said
lord
saltoun
with
a
smile
and
so
it
happened
that
horne
fisher
arrived
some
days
later
at
the
little
station
of
a
rather
remote
market
town
in
the
west
accompanied
by
a
light
suitcase
and
a
lively
brother
it
must
not
be
supposed
however
that
the
brother
'
s
cheerful
tone
consisted
entirely
of
chaff
he
supported
the
new
candidate
with
hope
as
well
as
hilarity
and
at
the
back
of
his
boisterous
partnership
there
was
an
increasing
sympathy
and
encouragement
harry
fisher
had
always
had
an
affection
for
his
more
quiet
and
eccentric
brother
and
was
now
coming
more
and
more
to
have
a
respect
for
him
as
the
campaign
proceeded
the
respect
increased
to
ardent
admiration
for
harry
was
still
young
and
could
feel
the
sort
of
enthusiasm
for
his
captain
in
electioneering
that
a
schoolboy
can
feel
for
his
captain
in
cricket
nor
was
the
admiration
undeserved
as
the
new
three
-
cornered
contest
developed
it
became
apparent
to
others
besides
his
devoted
kinsman
that
there
was
more
in
horne
fisher
than
had
ever
met
the
eye
it
was
clear
that
his
outbreak
by
the
family
fireside
had
been
but
the
culmination
of
a
long
course
of
brooding
and
studying
on
the
question
the
talent
he
retained
through
life
for
studying
his
subject
and
even
somebodys
else
'
s
subject
had
long
been
concentrated
on
this
idea
of
championing
a
new
peasantry
against
a
new
plutocracy
he
spoke
to
a
crowd
with
eloquence
and
replied
to
an
individual
with
humor
two
political
arts
that
seemed
to
come
to
him
naturally
he
certainly
knew
much
more
about
rural
problems
than
either
hughes
the
reform
candidate
or
verner
the
constitutional
candidate
and
he
probed
those
problems
with
a
human
curiosity
and
went
below
the
surface
in
a
way
that
neither
of
them
dreamed
of
doing
he
soon
became
the
voice
of
popular
feelings
that
are
never
found
in
the
popular
press
new
angles
of
criticism
arguments
that
had
never
before
been
uttered
by
an
educated
voice
tests
and
comparisons
that
had
been
made
only
in
dialect
by
men
drinking
in
the
little
local
public
houses
crafts
half
forgotten
that
had
come
down
by
sign
of
hand
and
tongue
from
remote
ages
when
their
fathers
were
free
all
this
created
a
curious
and
double
excitement
it
startled
the
well
informed
by
being
a
new
and
fantastic
idea
they
had
never
encountered
it
startled
the
ignorant
by
being
an
old
and
familiar
idea
they
never
thought
to
have
seen
revived
men
saw
things
in
a
new
light
and
knew
not
even
whether
it
was
the
sunset
or
the
dawn
practical
grievances
were
there
to
make
the
movement
formidable
as
fisher
went
to
and
fro
among
the
cottages
and
country
inns
it
was
borne
in
on
him
without
difficulty
that
sir
francis
verner
was
a
very
bad
landlord
nor
was
the
story
of
his
acquisition
of
the
land
any
more
ancient
and
dignified
than
he
had
supposed
the
story
was
well
known
in
the
county
and
in
most
respects
was
obvious
enough
hawker
the
old
squire
had
been
a
loose
unsatisfactory
sort
of
person
had
been
on
bad
terms
with
his
first
wife
(
who
died
as
some
said
of
neglect
)
and
had
then
married
a
flashy
south
american
jewess
with
a
fortune
but
he
must
have
worked
his
way
through
this
fortune
also
with
marvelous
rapidity
for
he
had
been
compelled
to
sell
the
estate
to
verner
and
had
gone
to
live
in
south
america
possibly
on
his
wife
'
s
estates
but
fisher
noticed
that
the
laxity
of
the
old
squire
was
far
less
hated
than
the
efficiency
of
the
new
squire
verner
'
s
history
seemed
to
be
full
of
smart
bargains
and
financial
flutters
that
left
other
people
short
of
money
and
temper
but
though
he
heard
a
great
deal
about
verner
there
was
one
thing
that
continually
eluded
him
something
that
nobody
knew
that
even
saltoun
had
not
known
he
could
not
find
out
how
verner
had
originally
made
his
money
he
must
have
kept
it
specially
dark
said
horne
fisher
to
himself
it
must
be
something
he
is
really
ashamed
of
hang
it
all
what
is
a
man
ashamed
of
nowadays
and
as
he
pondered
on
the
possibilities
they
grew
darker
and
more
distorted
in
his
mind
he
thought
vaguely
of
things
remote
and
repulsive
strange
forms
of
slavery
or
sorcery
and
then
of
ugly
things
yet
more
unnatural
but
nearer
home
the
figure
of
verner
seemed
to
be
blackened
and
transfigured
in
his
imagination
and
to
stand
against
varied
backgrounds
and
strange
skies
as
he
strode
up
a
village
street
brooding
thus
his
eyes
encountered
a
complete
contrast
in
the
face
of
his
other
rival
the
reform
candidate
eric
hughes
with
his
blown
blond
hair
and
eager
undergraduate
face
was
just
getting
into
his
motor
car
and
saying
a
few
final
words
to
his
agent
a
sturdy
grizzled
man
named
gryce
eric
hughes
waved
his
hand
in
a
friendly
fashion
but
gryce
eyed
him
with
some
hostility
eric
hughes
was
a
young
man
with
genuine
political
enthusiasms
but
he
knew
that
political
opponents
are
people
with
whom
one
may
have
to
dine
any
day
but
mr
gryce
was
a
grim
little
local
radical
a
champion
of
the
chapel
and
one
of
those
happy
people
whose
work
is
also
their
hobby
he
turned
his
back
as
the
motor
car
drove
away
and
walked
briskly
up
the
sunlit
high
street
of
the
little
town
whistling
with
political
papers
sticking
out
of
his
pocket
fisher
looked
pensively
after
the
resolute
figure
for
a
moment
and
then
as
if
by
an
impulse
began
to
follow
it
through
the
busy
market
place
amid
the
baskets
and
barrows
of
market
day
under
the
painted
wooden
sign
of
the
green
dragon
up
a
dark
side
entry
under
an
arch
and
through
a
tangle
of
crooked
cobbled
streets
the
two
threaded
their
way
the
square
strutting
figure
in
front
and
the
lean
lounging
figure
behind
him
like
his
shadow
in
the
sunshine
at
length
they
came
to
a
brown
brick
house
with
a
brass
plate
on
which
was
mr
gryce
'
s
name
and
that
individual
turned
and
beheld
his
pursuer
with
a
stare
could
i
have
a
word
with
you
sir
asked
horne
fisher
politely
the
agent
stared
still
more
but
assented
civilly
and
led
the
other
into
an
office
littered
with
leaflets
and
hung
all
round
with
highly
colored
posters
which
linked
the
name
of
hughes
with
all
the
higher
interests
of
humanity
mr
horne
fisher
i
believe
said
mr
gryce
much
honored
by
the
call
of
course
ca
not
pretend
to
congratulate
you
on
entering
the
contest
i
am
afraid
you
wo
not
expect
that
here
we
'
ve
been
keeping
the
old
flag
flying
for
freedom
and
reform
and
you
come
in
and
break
the
battle
line
for
mr
elijah
gryce
abounded
in
military
metaphors
and
in
denunciations
of
militarism
he
was
a
square
-
jawed
blunt
-
featured
man
with
a
pugnacious
cock
of
the
eyebrow
he
had
been
pickled
in
the
politics
of
that
countryside
from
boyhood
he
knew
everybody
'
s
secrets
and
electioneering
was
the
romance
of
his
life
i
suppose
you
think
i
am
devoured
with
ambition
said
horne
fisher
in
his
rather
listless
voice
aiming
at
a
dictatorship
and
all
that
well
i
think
i
can
clear
myself
of
the
charge
of
mere
selfish
ambition
i
only
want
certain
things
done
i
do
not
want
to
do
them
i
very
seldom
want
to
do
anything
and
i
'
ve
come
here
to
say
that
i
am
quite
willing
to
retire
from
the
contest
if
you
can
convince
me
that
we
really
want
to
do
the
same
thing
the
agent
of
the
reform
party
looked
at
him
with
an
odd
and
slightly
puzzled
expression
and
before
he
could
reply
fisher
went
on
in
the
same
level
tones
you
'
d
hardly
believe
it
but
i
keep
a
conscience
concealed
about
me
and
i
am
in
doubt
about
several
things
for
instance
we
both
want
to
turn
verner
out
of
parliament
but
what
weapon
are
we
to
use
i
'
ve
heard
a
lot
of
gossip
against
him
but
is
it
right
to
act
on
mere
gossip
just
as
i
want
to
be
fair
to
you
so
i
want
to
be
fair
to
him
if
some
of
the
things
i
'
ve
heard
are
true
he
ought
to
be
turned
out
of
parliament
and
every
other
club
in
london
but
i
do
not
want
to
turn
him
out
of
parliament
if
they
are
not
true
at
this
point
the
light
of
battle
sprang
into
mr
gryce
'
s
eyes
and
he
became
voluble
not
to
say
violent
he
at
any
rate
had
no
doubt
that
the
stories
were
true
he
could
testify
to
his
own
knowledge
that
they
were
true
verner
was
not
only
a
hard
landlord
but
a
mean
landlord
a
robber
as
well
as
a
rackrenter
any
gentleman
would
be
justified
in
hounding
him
out
he
had
cheated
old
wilkins
out
of
his
freehold
by
a
trick
fit
for
a
pickpocket
he
had
driven
old
mother
biddle
to
the
workhouse
he
had
stretched
the
law
against
long
adam
the
poacher
till
all
the
magistrates
were
ashamed
of
him
so
if
you
will
serve
under
the
old
banner
concluded
mr
gryce
more
genially
and
turn
out
a
swindling
tyrant
like
that
i
am
sure
you
will
never
regret
it
and
if
that
is
the
truth
said
horne
fisher
are
you
going
to
tell
it
what
do
you
mean
tell
the
truth
demanded
gryce
i
mean
you
are
going
to
tell
the
truth
as
you
have
just
told
it
replied
fisher
you
are
going
to
placard
this
town
with
the
wickedness
done
to
old
wilkins
you
are
going
to
fill
the
newspapers
with
the
infamous
story
of
mrs
biddle
you
are
going
to
denounce
verner
from
a
public
platform
naming
him
for
what
he
did
and
naming
the
poacher
he
did
it
to
and
you
are
going
to
find
out
by
what
trade
this
man
made
the
money
with
which
he
bought
the
estate
and
when
you
know
the
truth
as
i
said
before
of
course
you
are
going
to
tell
it
upon
those
terms
i
come
under
the
old
flag
as
you
call
it
and
haul
down
my
little
pennon
the
agent
was
eying
him
with
a
curious
expression
surly
but
not
entirely
unsympathetic
well
he
said
slowly
you
have
to
do
these
things
in
a
regular
way
you
know
or
people
do
not
understand
i
'
ve
had
a
lot
of
experience
and
i
am
afraid
what
you
say
would
not
do
people
understand
slanging
squires
in
a
general
way
but
those
personalities
are
not
considered
fair
play
looks
like
hitting
below
the
belt
old
wilkins
has
not
got
a
belt
i
suppose
replied
horne
fisher
verner
can
hit
him
anyhow
and
nobody
must
say
a
word
it
is
evidently
very
important
to
have
a
belt
but
apparently
you
have
to
be
rather
high
up
in
society
to
have
one
possibly
he
added
thoughtfully
possibly
the
explanation
of
the
phrase
'
a
belted
earl
'
the
meaning
of
which
has
always
escaped
me
i
mean
those
personalities
wo
not
do
returned
gryce
frowning
at
the
table
and
mother
biddle
and
long
adam
the
poacher
are
not
personalities
said
fisher
and
suppose
we
must
not
ask
how
verner
made
all
the
money
that
enabled
him
to
become
a
personality
gryce
was
still
looking
at
him
under
lowering
brows
but
the
singular
light
in
his
eyes
had
brightened
at
last
he
said
in
another
and
much
quieter
voice
look
here
sir
i
like
you
if
you
do
not
mind
my
saying
so
i
think
you
are
really
on
the
side
of
the
people
and
i
am
sure
you
are
a
brave
man
a
lot
braver
than
you
know
perhaps
we
dare
not
touch
what
you
propose
with
a
barge
pole
and
so
far
from
wanting
you
in
the
old
party
we
'
d
rather
you
ran
your
own
risk
by
yourself
but
because
i
like
you
and
respect
your
pluck
i
will
do
you
a
good
turn
before
we
part
i
do
not
want
you
to
waste
time
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
you
talk
about
how
the
new
squire
got
the
money
to
buy
and
the
ruin
of
the
old
squire
and
all
the
rest
of
it
well
i
will
give
you
a
hint
about
that
a
hint
about
something
precious
few
people
know
i
am
very
grateful
said
fisher
gravely
what
is
it
it
is
in
two
words
said
the
other
the
new
squire
was
quite
poor
when
he
bought
the
old
squire
was
quite
rich
when
he
sold
horne
fisher
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
as
he
turned
away
abruptly
and
busied
himself
with
the
papers
on
his
desk
then
fisher
uttered
a
short
phrase
of
thanks
and
farewell
and
went
out
into
the
street
still
very
thoughtful
his
reflection
seemed
to
end
in
resolution
and
falling
into
a
more
rapid
stride
he
passed
out
of
the
little
town
along
a
road
leading
toward
the
gate
of
the
great
park
the
country
seat
of
sir
francis
verner
a
glitter
of
sunlight
made
the
early
winter
more
like
a
late
autumn
and
the
dark
woods
were
touched
here
and
there
with
red
and
golden
leaves
like
the
last
rays
of
a
lost
sunset
from
a
higher
part
of
the
road
he
had
seen
the
long
classical
facade
of
the
great
house
with
its
many
windows
almost
immediately
beneath
him
but
when
the
road
ran
down
under
the
wall
of
the
estate
topped
with
towering
trees
behind
he
realized
that
it
was
half
a
mile
round
to
the
lodge
gates
after
walking
for
a
few
minutes
along
the
lane
however
he
came
to
a
place
where
the
wall
had
cracked
and
was
in
process
of
repair
as
it
was
there
was
a
great
gap
in
the
gray
masonry
that
looked
at
first
as
black
as
a
cavern
and
only
showed
at
a
second
glance
the
twilight
of
the
twinkling
trees
there
was
something
fascinating
about
that
unexpected
gate
like
the
opening
of
a
fairy
tale
horne
fisher
had
in
him
something
of
the
aristocrat
which
is
very
near
to
the
anarchist
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
he
turned
into
this
dark
and
irregular
entry
as
casually
as
into
his
own
front
door
merely
thinking
that
it
would
be
a
short
cut
to
the
house
he
made
his
way
through
the
dim
wood
for
some
distance
and
with
some
difficulty
until
there
began
to
shine
through
the
trees
a
level
light
in
lines
of
silver
which
he
did
not
at
first
understand
the
next
moment
he
had
come
out
into
the
daylight
at
the
top
of
a
steep
bank
at
the
bottom
of
which
a
path
ran
round
the
rim
of
a
large
ornamental
lake
the
sheet
of
water
which
he
had
seen
shimmering
through
the
trees
was
of
considerable
extent
but
was
walled
in
on
every
side
with
woods
which
were
not
only
dark
but
decidedly
dismal
at
one
end
of
the
path
was
a
classical
statue
of
some
nameless
nymph
and
at
the
other
end
it
was
flanked
by
two
classical
urns
but
the
marble
was
weather
-
stained
and
streaked
with
green
and
gray
a
hundred
other
signs
smaller
but
more
significant
told
him
that
he
had
come
on
some
outlying
corner
of
the
grounds
neglected
and
seldom
visited
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
was
what
appeared
to
be
an
island
and
on
the
island
what
appeared
to
be
meant
for
a
classical
temple
not
open
like
a
temple
of
the
winds
but
with
a
blank
wall
between
its
doric
pillars
we
may
say
it
only
seemed
like
an
island
because
a
second
glance
revealed
a
low
causeway
of
flat
stones
running
up
to
it
from
the
shore
and
turning
it
into
a
peninsula
and
certainly
it
only
seemed
like
a
temple
for
nobody
knew
better
than
horne
fisher
that
no
god
had
ever
dwelt
in
that
shrine
that
'
s
what
makes
all
this
classical
landscape
gardening
so
desolate
he
said
to
himself
more
desolate
than
stonehenge
or
the
pyramids
we
do
not
believe
in
egyptian
mythology
but
the
egyptians
did
and
i
suppose
even
the
druids
believed
in
druidism
but
the
eighteenth
-
century
gentleman
who
built
these
temples
did
not
believe
in
venus
or
mercury
any
more
than
we
do
that
'
s
why
the
reflection
of
those
pale
pillars
in
the
lake
is
truly
only
the
shadow
of
a
shade
they
were
men
of
the
age
of
reason
they
who
filled
their
gardens
with
these
stone
nymphs
had
less
hope
than
any
men
in
all
history
of
really
meeting
a
nymph
in
the
forest
his
monologue
stopped
aruptly
with
a
sharp
noise
like
a
thundercrack
that
rolled
in
dreary
echoes
round
the
dismal
mere
he
knew
at
once
what
it
was
somebody
had
fired
off
a
gun
but
as
to
the
meaning
of
it
he
was
momentarily
staggered
and
strange
thoughts
thronged
into
his
mind
the
next
moment
he
laughed
for
he
saw
lying
a
little
way
along
the
path
below
him
the
dead
bird
that
the
shot
had
brought
down
at
the
same
moment
however
he
saw
something
else
which
interested
him
more
a
ring
of
dense
trees
ran
round
the
back
of
the
island
temple
framing
the
facade
of
it
in
dark
foliage
and
he
could
have
sworn
he
saw
a
stir
as
of
something
moving
among
the
leaves
the
next
moment
his
suspicion
was
confirmed
for
a
rather
ragged
figure
came
from
under
the
shadow
of
the
temple
and
began
to
move
along
the
causeway
that
led
to
the
bank
even
at
that
distance
the
figure
was
conspicuous
by
its
great
height
and
fisher
could
see
that
the
man
carried
a
gun
under
his
arm
there
came
back
into
his
memory
at
once
the
name
long
adam
the
poacher
with
a
rapid
sense
of
strategy
he
sometimes
showed
fisher
sprang
from
the
bank
and
raced
round
the
lake
to
the
head
of
the
little
pier
of
stones
if
once
a
man
reached
the
mainland
he
could
easily
vanish
into
the
woods
but
when
fisher
began
to
advance
along
the
stones
toward
the
island
the
man
was
cornered
in
a
blind
alley
and
could
only
back
toward
the
temple
putting
his
broad
shoulders
against
it
he
stood
as
if
at
bay
he
was
a
comparatively
young
man
with
fine
lines
in
his
lean
face
and
figure
and
a
mop
of
ragged
red
hair
the
look
in
his
eyes
might
well
have
been
disquieting
to
anyone
left
alone
with
him
on
an
island
in
the
middle
of
a
lake
good
morning
said
horne
fisher
pleasantly
i
thought
at
first
you
were
a
murderer
but
it
seems
unlikely
somehow
that
the
partridge
rushed
between
us
and
died
for
love
of
me
like
the
heroines
in
the
romances
so
i
suppose
you
are
a
poacher
i
suppose
you
would
call
me
a
poacher
answered
the
man
and
his
voice
was
something
of
a
surprise
coming
from
such
a
scarecrow
it
had
that
hard
fastidiousness
to
be
found
in
those
who
have
made
a
fight
for
their
own
refinement
among
rough
surroundings
i
consider
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
shoot
game
in
this
place
but
i
am
well
aware
that
people
of
your
sort
take
me
for
a
thief
and
i
suppose
you
will
try
to
land
me
in
jail
there
are
preliminary
difficulties
replied
fisher
to
begin
with
the
mistake
is
flattering
but
i
am
not
a
gamekeeper
still
less
am
i
three
gamekeepers
who
would
be
i
imagine
about
your
fighting
weight
but
i
confess
i
have
another
reason
for
not
wanting
to
jail
you
and
what
is
that
asked
the
other
only
that
i
quite
agree
with
you
answered
fisher
i
do
not
exactly
say
you
have
a
right
to
poach
but
i
never
could
see
that
it
was
as
wrong
as
being
a
thief
it
seems
to
me
against
the
whole
normal
notion
of
property
that
a
man
should
own
something
because
it
flies
across
his
garden
he
might
as
well
own
the
wind
or
think
he
could
write
his
name
on
a
morning
cloud
besides
if
we
want
poor
people
to
respect
property
we
must
give
them
some
property
to
respect
you
ought
to
have
land
of
your
own
and
i
am
going
to
give
you
some
if
i
can
going
to
give
me
some
land
repeated
long
adam
i
apologize
for
addressing
you
as
if
you
were
a
public
meeting
said
fisher
but
i
am
an
entirely
new
kind
of
public
man
who
says
the
same
thing
in
public
and
in
private
i
'
ve
said
this
to
a
hundred
huge
meetings
throughout
the
country
and
i
say
it
to
you
on
this
queer
little
island
in
this
dismal
pond
i
would
cut
up
a
big
estate
like
this
into
small
estates
for
everybody
even
for
poachers
i
would
do
in
england
as
they
did
in
ireland
buy
the
big
men
out
if
possible
get
them
out
anyhow
a
man
like
you
ought
to
have
a
little
place
of
his
own
i
do
not
say
you
could
keep
pheasants
but
you
might
keep
chickens
the
man
stiffened
suddenly
and
he
seemed
at
once
to
blanch
and
flame
at
the
promise
as
if
it
were
a
threat
chickens
he
repeated
with
a
passion
of
contempt
why
do
you
object
asked
the
placid
candidate
because
keeping
hens
is
rather
a
mild
amusement
for
a
poacher
what
about
poaching
eggs
because
i
am
not
a
poacher
cried
adam
in
a
rending
voice
that
rang
round
the
hollow
shrines
and
urns
like
the
echoes
of
his
gun
because
the
partridge
lying
dead
over
there
is
my
partridge
because
the
land
you
are
standing
on
is
my
land
because
my
own
land
was
only
taken
from
me
by
a
crime
and
a
worse
crime
than
poaching
this
has
been
a
single
estate
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
and
if
you
or
any
meddlesome
mountebank
comes
here
and
talks
of
cutting
it
up
like
a
cake
if
i
ever
hear
a
word
more
of
you
and
your
leveling
lies
you
seem
to
be
a
rather
turbulent
public
observed
horne
fisher
but
do
go
on
what
will
happen
if
i
try
to
divide
this
estate
decently
among
decent
people
the
poacher
had
recovered
a
grim
composure
as
he
replied
there
will
be
no
partridge
to
rush
in
between
with
that
he
turned
his
back
evidently
resolved
to
say
no
more
and
walked
past
the
temple
to
the
extreme
end
of
the
islet
where
he
stood
staring
into
the
water
fisher
followed
him
but
when
his
repeated
questions
evoked
no
answer
turned
back
toward
the
shore
in
doing
so
he
took
a
second
and
closer
look
at
the
artificial
temple
and
noted
some
curious
things
about
it
most
of
these
theatrical
things
were
as
thin
as
theatrical
scenery
and
he
expected
the
classic
shrine
to
be
a
shallow
thing
a
mere
shell
or
mask
but
there
was
some
substantial
bulk
of
it
behind
buried
in
the
trees
which
had
a
gray
labyrinthian
look
like
serpents
of
stone
and
lifted
a
load
of
leafy
towers
to
the
sky
but
what
arrested
fisher
'
s
eye
was
that
in
this
bulk
of
gray
-
white
stone
behind
there
was
a
single
door
with
great
rusty
bolts
outside
the
bolts
however
were
not
shot
across
so
as
to
secure
it
then
he
walked
round
the
small
building
and
found
no
other
opening
except
one
small
grating
like
a
ventilator
high
up
in
the
wall
he
retraced
his
steps
thoughtfully
along
the
causeway
to
the
banks
of
the
lake
and
sat
down
on
the
stone
steps
between
the
two
sculptured
funeral
urns
then
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
smoked
it
in
ruminant
manner
eventually
he
took
out
a
notebook
and
wrote
down
various
phrases
numbering
and
renumbering
them
till
they
stood
in
the
following
order

not

when
he
gave
up
the
estate
(

)
verner
was
poor
when
he
got
the
estate
he
gazed
at
these
notes
with
a
gravity
which
gradually
turned
to
a
hard
smile
threw
away
his
cigarette
and
resumed
his
search
for
a
short
cut
to
the
great
house
he
soon
picked
up
the
path
which
winding
among
clipped
hedges
and
flower
beds
brought
him
in
front
of
its
long
palladian
facade
it
had
the
usual
appearance
of
being
not
a
private
house
but
a
sort
of
public
building
sent
into
exile
in
the
provinces
he
first
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
butler
who
really
looked
much
older
than
the
building
for
the
architecture
was
dated
as
georgian
but
the
man
'
s
face
under
a
highly
unnatural
brown
wig
was
wrinkled
with
what
might
have
been
centuries
only
his
prominent
eyes
were
alive
and
alert
as
if
with
protest
fisher
glanced
at
him
and
then
stopped
and
said
excuse
me
were
not
you
with
the
late
squire
mr
hawker
'
yes
sir
said
the
man
gravely
usher
is
my
name
what
can
i
do
for
you
only
take
me
into
sir
francis
verner
replied
the
visitor
sir
francis
verner
was
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
beside
a
small
table
in
a
large
room
hung
with
tapestries
on
the
table
were
a
small
flask
and
glass
with
the
green
glimmer
of
a
liqueur
and
a
cup
of
black
coffee
he
was
clad
in
a
quiet
gray
suit
with
a
moderately
harmonious
purple
tie
but
fisher
saw
something
about
the
turn
of
his
fair
mustache
and
the
lie
of
his
flat
hair
it
suddenly
revealed
that
his
name
was
franz
werner
you
are
mr
horne
fisher
he
said
wo
not
you
sit
down
no
thank
you
replied
fisher
i
fear
this
is
not
a
friendly
occasion
and
i
shall
remain
standing
possibly
you
know
that
i
am
already
standing
standing
for
parliament
in
fact
i
am
aware
we
are
political
opponents
replied
verner
raising
his
eyebrows
but
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
we
fought
in
a
sporting
spirit
in
a
spirit
of
english
fair
play
much
better
assented
fisher
it
would
be
much
better
if
you
were
english
and
very
much
better
if
you
had
ever
played
fair
but
what
i
'
ve
come
to
say
can
be
said
very
shortly
i
do
not
quite
know
how
we
stand
with
the
law
about
that
old
hawker
story
but
my
chief
object
is
to
prevent
england
being
entirely
ruled
by
people
like
you
so
whatever
the
law
would
say
i
will
say
no
more
if
you
will
retire
from
the
election
at
once
you
are
evidently
a
lunatic
said
verner
my
psychology
may
be
a
little
abnormal
replied
horne
fisher
in
a
rather
hazy
manner
i
am
subject
to
dreams
especially
day
-
dreams
sometimes
what
is
happening
to
me
grows
vivid
in
a
curious
double
way
as
if
it
had
happened
before
have
you
ever
had
that
mystical
feeling
that
things
have
happened
before
i
hope
you
are
a
harmless
lunatic
said
verner
but
fisher
was
still
staring
in
an
absent
fashion
at
the
golden
gigantic
figures
and
traceries
of
brown
and
red
in
the
tapestries
on
the
walls
then
he
looked
again
at
verner
and
resumed
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
interview
has
happened
before
here
in
this
tapestried
room
and
we
are
two
ghosts
revisiting
a
haunted
chamber
but
it
was
squire
hawker
who
sat
where
you
sit
and
it
was
you
who
stood
where
i
stand
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
with
simplicity
i
suppose
i
am
a
blackmailer
too
if
you
are
said
sir
francis
i
promise
you
you
shall
go
to
jail
but
his
face
had
a
shade
on
it
that
looked
like
the
reflection
of
the
green
wine
gleaming
on
the
table
horne
fisher
regarded
him
steadily
and
answered
quietly
enough
blackmailers
do
not
always
go
to
jail
sometimes
they
go
to
parliament
but
though
parliament
is
rotten
enough
already
you
shall
not
go
there
if
i
can
help
it
i
am
not
so
criminal
as
you
were
in
bargaining
with
crime
you
made
a
squire
give
up
his
country
seat
i
only
ask
you
to
give
up
your
parliamentary
seat
sir
francis
verner
sprang
to
his
feet
and
looked
about
for
one
of
the
bell
ropes
of
the
old
-
fashioned
curtained
room
where
is
usher
he
cried
with
a
livid
face
and
who
is
usher
said
fisher
softly
i
wonder
how
much
usher
knows
of
the
truth
verner
'
s
hand
fell
from
the
bell
rope
and
after
standing
for
a
moment
with
rolling
eyes
he
strode
abruptly
from
the
room
fisher
went
but
by
the
other
door
by
which
he
had
entered
and
seeing
no
sign
of
usher
let
himself
out
and
betook
himself
again
toward
the
town
that
night
he
put
an
electric
torch
in
his
pocket
and
set
out
alone
in
the
darkness
to
add
the
last
links
to
his
argument
there
was
much
that
he
did
not
know
yet
but
he
thought
he
knew
where
he
could
find
the
knowledge
the
night
closed
dark
and
stormy
and
the
black
gap
in
the
wall
looked
blacker
than
ever
the
wood
seemed
to
have
grown
thicker
and
darker
in
a
day
if
the
deserted
lake
with
its
black
woods
and
gray
urns
and
images
looked
desolate
even
by
daylight
under
the
night
and
the
growing
storm
it
seemed
still
more
like
the
pool
of
acheron
in
the
land
of
lost
souls
as
he
stepped
carefully
along
the
jetty
stones
he
seemed
to
be
traveling
farther
and
farther
into
the
abyss
of
night
and
to
have
left
behind
him
the
last
points
from
which
it
would
be
possible
to
signal
to
the
land
of
the
living
the
lake
seemed
to
have
grown
larger
than
a
sea
but
a
sea
of
black
and
slimy
waters
that
slept
with
abominable
serenity
as
if
they
had
washed
out
the
world
there
was
so
much
of
this
nightmare
sense
of
extension
and
expansion
that
he
was
strangely
surprised
to
come
to
his
desert
island
so
soon
but
he
knew
it
for
a
place
of
inhuman
silence
and
solitude
and
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
walking
for
years
nerving
himself
to
a
more
normal
mood
he
paused
under
one
of
the
dark
dragon
trees
that
branched
out
above
him
and
taking
out
his
torch
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
temple
it
was
unbolted
as
before
and
the
thought
stirred
faintly
in
him
that
it
was
slightly
open
though
only
by
a
crack
the
more
he
thought
of
it
however
the
more
certain
he
grew
that
this
was
but
one
of
the
common
illusions
of
light
coming
from
a
different
angle
he
studied
in
a
more
scientific
spirit
the
details
of
the
door
with
its
rusty
bolts
and
hinges
when
he
became
conscious
of
something
very
near
him
indeed
nearly
above
his
head
something
was
dangling
from
the
tree
that
was
not
a
broken
branch
for
some
seconds
he
stood
as
still
as
a
stone
and
as
cold
what
he
saw
above
him
were
the
legs
of
a
man
hanging
presumably
a
dead
man
hanged
but
the
next
moment
he
knew
better
the
man
was
literally
alive
and
kicking
and
an
instant
after
he
had
dropped
to
the
ground
and
turned
on
the
intruder
simultaneously
three
or
four
other
trees
seemed
to
come
to
life
in
the
same
fashion
five
or
six
other
figures
had
fallen
on
their
feet
from
these
unnatural
nests
it
was
as
if
the
place
were
an
island
of
monkeys
but
a
moment
after
they
had
made
a
stampede
toward
him
and
when
they
laid
their
hands
on
him
he
knew
that
they
were
men
with
the
electric
torch
in
his
hand
he
struck
the
foremost
of
them
so
furiously
in
the
face
that
the
man
stumbled
and
rolled
over
on
the
slimy
grass
but
the
torch
was
broken
and
extinguished
leaving
everything
in
a
denser
obscurity
he
flung
another
man
flat
against
the
temple
wall
so
that
he
slid
to
the
ground
but
a
third
and
fourth
carried
fisher
off
his
feet
and
began
to
bear
him
struggling
toward
the
doorway
even
in
the
bewilderment
of
the
battle
he
was
conscious
that
the
door
was
standing
open
somebody
was
summoning
the
roughs
from
inside
the
moment
they
were
within
they
hurled
him
upon
a
sort
of
bench
or
bed
with
violence
but
no
damage
for
the
settee
or
whatever
it
was
seemed
to
be
comfortably
cushioned
for
his
reception
their
violence
had
in
it
a
great
element
of
haste
and
before
he
could
rise
they
had
all
rushed
for
the
door
to
escape
whatever
bandits
they
were
that
infested
this
desert
island
they
were
obviously
uneasy
about
their
job
and
very
anxious
to
be
quit
of
it
he
had
the
flying
fancy
that
regular
criminals
would
hardly
be
in
such
a
panic
the
next
moment
the
great
door
crashed
to
and
he
could
hear
the
bolts
shriek
as
they
shot
into
their
place
and
the
feet
of
the
retreating
men
scampering
and
stumbling
along
the
causeway
but
rapidly
as
it
happened
it
did
not
happen
before
fisher
had
done
something
that
he
wanted
to
to
unable
to
rise
from
his
sprawling
attitude
in
that
flash
of
time
he
had
shot
out
one
of
his
long
legs
and
hooked
it
round
the
ankle
of
the
last
man
disappearing
through
the
door
the
man
swayed
and
toppled
over
inside
the
prison
chamber
and
the
door
closed
between
him
and
his
fleeing
companions
clearly
they
were
in
too
much
haste
to
realize
that
they
had
left
one
of
their
company
behind
the
man
sprang
to
his
feet
again
and
hammered
and
kicked
furiously
at
the
door
fisher
'
s
sense
of
humor
began
to
recover
from
the
struggle
and
he
sat
up
on
his
sofa
with
something
of
his
native
nonchalance
but
as
he
listened
to
the
captive
captor
beating
on
the
door
of
the
prison
a
new
and
curious
reflection
came
to
him
the
natural
course
for
a
man
thus
wishing
to
attract
his
friends
'
attention
would
be
to
call
out
to
shout
as
well
as
kick
this
man
was
making
as
much
noise
as
he
could
with
his
feet
and
hands
but
not
a
sound
came
from
his
throat
why
could
not
he
speak
at
first
he
thought
the
man
might
be
gagged
which
was
manifestly
absurd
then
his
fancy
fell
back
on
the
ugly
idea
that
the
man
was
dumb
he
hardly
knew
why
it
was
so
ugly
an
idea
but
it
affected
his
imagination
in
a
dark
and
disproportionate
fashion
there
seemed
to
be
something
creepy
about
the
idea
of
being
left
in
a
dark
room
with
a
deaf
mute
it
was
almost
as
if
such
a
defect
were
a
deformity
it
was
almost
as
if
it
went
with
other
and
worse
deformities
it
was
as
if
the
shape
he
could
not
trace
in
the
darkness
were
some
shape
that
should
not
see
the
sun
then
he
had
a
flash
of
sanity
and
also
of
insight
the
explanation
was
very
simple
but
rather
interesting
obviously
the
man
did
not
use
his
voice
because
he
did
not
wish
his
voice
to
be
recognized
he
hoped
to
escape
from
that
dark
place
before
fisher
found
out
who
he
was
and
who
was
he
one
thing
at
least
was
clear
he
was
one
or
other
of
the
four
or
five
men
with
whom
fisher
had
already
talked
in
these
parts
and
in
the
development
of
that
strange
story
now
i
wonder
who
you
are
he
said
aloud
with
all
his
old
lazy
urbanity
i
suppose
it
is
no
use
trying
to
throttle
you
in
order
to
find
out
it
would
be
displeasing
to
pass
the
night
with
a
corpse
besides
i
might
be
the
corpse
i
'
ve
got
no
matches
and
i
'
ve
smashed
my
torch
so
i
can
only
speculate
who
could
you
be
now
let
us
think
the
man
thus
genially
addressed
had
desisted
from
drumming
on
the
door
and
retreated
sullenly
into
a
corner
as
fisher
continued
to
address
him
in
a
flowing
monologue
probably
you
are
the
poacher
who
says
he
is
not
a
poacher
he
says
he
is
a
landed
proprietor
but
he
will
permit
me
to
inform
him
that
whatever
he
is
he
is
a
fool
what
hope
can
there
ever
be
of
a
free
peasantry
in
england
if
the
peasants
themselves
are
such
snobs
as
to
want
to
be
gentlemen
how
can
we
make
a
democracy
with
no
democrats
as
it
is
you
want
to
be
a
landlord
and
so
you
consent
to
be
a
criminal
and
in
that
you
know
you
are
rather
like
somebody
else
and
now
i
think
of
it
perhaps
you
are
somebody
else
there
was
a
silence
broken
by
breathing
from
the
corner
and
the
murmur
of
the
rising
storm
that
came
in
through
the
small
grating
above
the
man
'
s
head
horne
fisher
continued
are
you
only
a
servant
perhaps
that
rather
sinister
old
servant
who
was
butler
to
hawker
and
verner
if
so
you
are
certainly
the
only
link
between
the
two
periods
but
if
so
why
do
you
degrade
yourself
to
serve
this
dirty
foreigner
when
you
at
least
saw
the
last
of
a
genuine
national
gentry
people
like
you
are
generally
at
least
patriotic
does
not
england
mean
anything
to
you
mr
usher
all
of
which
eloquence
is
possibly
wasted
as
perhaps
you
are
not
mr
usher
more
likely
you
are
verner
himself
and
it
is
no
good
wasting
eloquence
to
make
you
ashamed
of
yourself
nor
is
it
any
good
to
curse
you
for
corrupting
england
nor
are
you
the
right
person
to
curse
it
is
the
english
who
deserve
to
be
cursed
and
are
cursed
because
they
allowed
such
vermin
to
crawl
into
the
high
places
of
their
heroes
and
their
kings
i
wo
not
dwell
on
the
idea
that
you
are
verner
or
the
throttling
might
begin
after
all
is
there
anyone
else
you
could
be
surely
you
are
not
some
servant
of
the
other
rival
organization
i
ca
not
believe
you
are
gryce
the
agent
and
yet
gryce
had
a
spark
of
the
fanatic
in
his
eye
too
and
men
will
do
extraordinary
things
in
these
paltry
feuds
of
politics
or
if
not
the
servant
is
it
the
no
i
ca
not
believe
it
not
the
red
blood
of
manhood
and
liberty
not
the
democratic
ideal
he
sprang
up
in
excitement
and
at
the
same
moment
a
growl
of
thunder
came
through
the
grating
beyond
the
storm
had
broken
and
with
it
a
new
light
broke
on
his
mind
there
was
something
else
that
might
happen
in
a
moment
do
you
know
what
that
means
he
cried
it
means
that
god
himself
may
hold
a
candle
to
show
me
your
infernal
face
then
next
moment
came
a
crash
of
thunder
but
before
the
thunder
a
white
light
had
filled
the
whole
room
for
a
single
split
second
fisher
had
seen
two
things
in
front
of
him
one
was
the
black
-
and
-
white
pattern
of
the
iron
grating
against
the
sky
the
other
was
the
face
in
the
corner
it
was
the
face
of
his
brother
nothing
came
from
horne
fisher
'
s
lips
except
a
christian
name
which
was
followed
by
a
silence
more
dreadful
than
the
dark
at
last
the
other
figure
stirred
and
sprang
up
and
the
voice
of
harry
fisher
was
heard
for
the
first
time
in
that
horrible
room
you
'
ve
seen
me
i
suppose
he
said
and
we
may
as
well
have
a
light
now
you
could
have
turned
it
on
at
any
time
if
you
'
d
found
the
switch
he
pressed
a
button
in
the
wall
and
all
the
details
of
that
room
sprang
into
something
stronger
than
daylight
indeed
the
details
were
so
unexpected
that
for
a
moment
they
turned
the
captive
'
s
rocking
mind
from
the
last
personal
revelation
the
room
so
far
from
being
a
dungeon
cell
was
more
like
a
drawing
-
room
even
a
lady
'
s
drawing
-
room
except
for
some
boxes
of
cigars
and
bottles
of
wine
that
were
stacked
with
books
and
magazines
on
a
side
table
a
second
glance
showed
him
that
the
more
masculine
fittings
were
quite
recent
and
that
the
more
feminine
background
was
quite
old
his
eye
caught
a
strip
of
faded
tapestry
which
startled
him
into
speech
to
the
momentary
oblivion
of
bigger
matters
this
place
was
furnished
from
the
great
house
he
said
yes
replied
the
other
and
i
think
you
know
why
i
think
i
do
said
horne
fisher
and
before
i
go
on
to
more
extraordinary
things
i
will
say
what
i
think
squire
hawker
played
both
the
bigamist
and
the
bandit
his
first
wife
was
not
dead
when
he
married
the
jewess
she
was
imprisoned
on
this
island
she
bore
him
a
child
here
who
now
haunts
his
birthplace
under
the
name
of
long
adam
a
bankruptcy
company
promoter
named
werner
discovered
the
secret
and
blackmailed
the
squire
into
surrendering
the
estate
that
'
s
all
quite
clear
and
very
easy
and
now
let
me
go
on
to
something
more
difficult
and
that
is
for
you
to
explain
what
the
devil
you
are
doing
kidnaping
your
born
brother
after
a
pause
henry
fisher
answered
i
suppose
you
did
not
expect
to
see
me
he
said
but
after
all
what
could
you
expect
i
am
afraid
i
do
not
follow
said
horne
fisher
i
mean
what
else
could
you
expect
after
making
such
a
muck
of
it
said
his
brother
sulkily
we
all
thought
you
were
so
clever
how
could
we
know
you
were
going
to
be
well
really
such
a
rotten
failure
this
is
rather
curious
said
the
candidate
frowning
without
vanity
i
was
not
under
the
impression
that
my
candidature
was
a
failure
all
the
big
meetings
were
successful
and
crowds
of
people
have
promised
me
votes
i
should
jolly
well
think
they
had
said
'
henry
grimly
you
'
ve
made
a
landslide
with
your
confounded
acres
and
a
cow
and
verner
can
hardly
get
a
vote
anywhere
oh
it
is
too
rotten
for
anything
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
why
you
lunatic
cried
henry
in
tones
of
ringing
sincerity
you
do
not
suppose
you
were
meant
to
win
the
seat
did
you
oh
it
is
too
childish
i
tell
you
verner
'
s
got
to
get
in
of
course
he
is
got
to
get
in
he
is
to
have
the
exchequer
next
session
and
there
'
s
the
egyptian
loan
and
lord
knows
what
else
we
only
wanted
you
to
split
the
reform
vote
because
accidents
might
happen
after
hughes
had
made
a
score
at
barkington
i
see
said
fisher
and
you
i
think
are
a
pillar
and
ornament
of
the
reform
party
as
you
say
i
am
not
clever
the
appeal
to
party
loyalty
fell
on
deaf
ears
for
the
pillar
of
reform
was
brooding
on
other
things
at
last
he
said
in
a
more
troubled
voice
i
did
not
want
you
to
catch
me
i
knew
it
would
be
a
shock
but
i
tell
you
what
you
never
would
have
caught
me
if
i
had
not
come
here
myself
to
see
they
did
not
ill
treat
you
and
to
make
sure
everything
was
as
comfortable
as
it
could
be
there
was
even
a
sort
of
break
in
his
voice
as
he
added
i
got
those
cigars
because
i
knew
you
liked
them
emotions
are
queer
things
and
the
idiocy
of
this
concession
suddenly
softened
horne
fisher
like
an
unfathomable
pathos
never
mind
old
chap
he
said
we
will
say
no
more
about
it
i
will
admit
that
you
are
really
as
kind
-
hearted
and
affectionate
a
scoundrel
and
hypocrite
as
ever
sold
himself
to
ruin
his
country
there
i
ca
not
say
handsomer
than
that
thank
you
for
the
cigars
old
man
i
will
have
one
if
you
do
not
mind
by
the
time
that
horne
fisher
had
ended
his
telling
of
this
story
to
harold
march
they
had
come
out
into
one
of
the
public
parks
and
taken
a
seat
on
a
rise
of
ground
overlooking
wide
green
spaces
under
a
blue
and
empty
sky
and
there
was
something
incongruous
in
the
words
with
which
the
narration
ended
i
have
been
in
that
room
ever
since
said
horne
fisher
i
am
in
it
now
i
won
the
election
but
i
never
went
to
the
house
my
life
has
been
a
life
in
that
little
room
on
that
lonely
island
plenty
of
books
and
cigars
and
luxuries
plenty
of
knowledge
and
interest
and
information
but
never
a
voice
out
of
that
tomb
to
reach
the
world
outside
i
shall
probably
die
there
and
he
smiled
as
he
looked
across
the
vast
green
park
to
the
gray
horizon
it
was
on
the
sunny
veranda
of
a
seaside
hotel
overlooking
a
pattern
of
flower
beds
and
a
strip
of
blue
sea
that
horne
fisher
and
harold
march
had
their
final
explanation
which
might
be
called
an
explosion
harold
march
had
come
to
the
little
table
and
sat
down
at
it
with
a
subdued
excitement
smoldering
in
his
somewhat
cloudy
and
dreamy
blue
eyes
in
the
newspapers
which
he
tossed
from
him
on
to
the
table
there
was
enough
to
explain
some
if
not
all
of
his
emotion
public
affairs
in
every
department
had
reached
a
crisis
the
government
which
had
stood
so
long
that
men
were
used
to
it
as
they
are
used
to
a
hereditary
despotism
had
begun
to
be
accused
of
blunders
and
even
of
financial
abuses
some
said
that
the
experiment
of
attempting
to
establish
a
peasantry
in
the
west
of
england
on
the
lines
of
an
early
fancy
of
horne
fisher
'
s
had
resulted
in
nothing
but
dangerous
quarrels
with
more
industrial
neighbors
there
had
been
particular
complaints
of
the
ill
treatment
of
harmless
foreigners
chiefly
asiatics
who
happened
to
be
employed
in
the
new
scientific
works
constructed
on
the
coast
indeed
the
new
power
which
had
arisen
in
siberia
backed
by
japan
and
other
powerful
allies
was
inclined
to
take
the
matter
up
in
the
interests
of
its
exiled
subjects
and
there
had
been
wild
talk
about
ambassadors
and
ultimatums
but
something
much
more
serious
in
its
personal
interest
for
march
himself
seemed
to
fill
his
meeting
with
his
friend
with
a
mixture
of
embarrassment
and
indignation
perhaps
it
increased
his
annoyance
that
there
was
a
certain
unusual
liveliness
about
the
usually
languid
figure
of
fisher
the
ordinary
image
of
him
in
march
'
s
mind
was
that
of
a
pallid
and
bald
-
browed
gentleman
who
seemed
to
be
prematurely
old
as
well
as
prematurely
bald
he
was
remembered
as
a
man
who
expressed
the
opinions
of
a
pessimist
in
the
language
of
a
lounger
even
now
march
could
not
be
certain
whether
the
change
was
merely
a
sort
of
masquerade
of
sunshine
or
that
effect
of
clear
colors
and
clean
-
cut
outlines
that
is
always
visible
on
the
parade
of
a
marine
resort
relieved
against
the
blue
dado
of
the
sea
but
fisher
had
a
flower
in
his
buttonhole
and
his
friend
could
have
sworn
he
carried
his
cane
with
something
almost
like
the
swagger
of
a
fighter
with
such
clouds
gathering
over
england
the
pessimist
seemed
to
be
the
only
man
who
carried
his
own
sunshine
look
here
said
harold
march
abruptly
you
'
ve
been
no
end
of
a
friend
to
me
and
i
never
was
so
proud
of
a
friendship
before
but
there
'
s
something
i
must
get
off
my
chest
the
more
i
found
out
the
less
i
understood
how
you
could
stand
it
and
i
tell
you
i
am
going
to
stand
it
no
longer
horne
fisher
gazed
across
at
him
gravely
and
attentively
but
rather
as
if
he
were
a
long
way
off
you
know
i
always
liked
you
said
fisher
quietly
but
i
also
respect
you
which
is
not
always
the
same
thing
you
may
possibly
guess
that
i
like
a
good
many
people
i
do
not
respect
perhaps
it
is
my
tragedy
perhaps
it
is
my
fault
but
you
are
very
different
and
i
promise
you
this
that
i
will
never
try
to
keep
you
as
somebody
to
be
liked
at
the
price
of
your
not
being
respected
i
know
you
are
magnanimous
said
march
after
a
silence
and
yet
you
tolerate
and
perpetuate
everything
that
is
mean
then
after
another
silence
he
added
do
you
remember
when
we
first
met
when
you
were
fishing
in
that
brook
in
the
affair
of
the
target
and
do
you
remember
you
said
that
after
all
it
might
do
no
harm
if
i
could
blow
the
whole
tangle
