the

the
doing

not
doing
something

everybody

have
their
way

were
to
take
up

show
by
force
that
they
were
the
effective

which
,
however
,
in
a
society
of
men
who
are
free

equal
is
little
likely
to
happen
;

in
such
a
community

apparent
majority
is
the
real
majority
,

the
others

pigheadedness

real
distinction

in
such
a
district

as
you
would
call
it
,
some
neighbours
think
that
something
ought
to
be
done

undone

a
new
town

hall
built
;
a
clearance
of
inconvenient
houses
;

a
stone
bridge

some
ugly
old
iron
one

the
next
ordinary
meeting
of

mote

as
we
call
it
,
according
to
the
ancient
tongue
of
the
times
before
bureaucracy
,
a
neighbour
proposes
the
change
,
and
of
course
,
if
everybody
agrees
,
there
is
an
end
of
discussion
,

about
details

,

no
one
backs
the

him
,
'
it
used
to
be
called
.
.
.
.

.
.
the
matter
drops
for
the
time
being
;
a
thing
not
likely
to
happen
amongst
reasonable
men
,
however
,
as
the
proposer
is
sure
to
have
talked
it
over
with
others
before
the
mote
.
but
supposing
the
affair
proposed
and
seconded
,
if
a
few
of
the
neighbours
disagree
to
it
,
if
they
think
that
the
beastly
iron
bridge
will
serve
a
little
longer
and
they
do
not
want
to
be
bothered
with
building
a
new
one
just
then
,
they
do
not
count
heads
that
time
,
but
put
off
the
formal
discussion
to
the
next
mote
;
and
meantime
arguments
pro
and
con
are
flying
about
,
and
some
get
printed
,
so
that
everybody
knows
what
is
going
on
;
and
when
the
mote
comes
together
again
there
is
a
regular
discussion
and
at
last
a
vote
by
show
of
hands
.
if
the
division
is
a
close
one
,
the
question
is
again
put
off
for
further
discussion
;
if
the
division
is
a
wide
one
,
the
minority
are
asked
if
they
will
yield
to
the
more
general
opinion
,
which
they
often
,
nay
,
most
commonly
do
.
if
they
refuse
,
the
question
is
debated
a
third
time
,
when
,
if
the
minority
has
not
perceptibly
grown
,
they
always
give
way
;
though
i
believe
there
is
some
half
-
forgotten
rule
by
which
they
might
still
carry
it
on
further
;
but
i
say
,
what
always
happens
is
that
they
are
convinced
,
not
perhaps
that
their
view
is
the
wrong
one
,
but
they
cannot
persuade
or
force
the
community
to
adopt
it
.
"
"

as
a

principle

according

the
rule

must
then
lapse

the

,

narrow
,

to
submit
to
sitting
down
under
the
status
quo

i
must
tell
you
that
in
point
of
fact
the
minority
very
seldom
enforces
this

generally
yields

a
friendly
manner

that
there
is
something
in

yes

more
plainly

the

it

be
expended

useless
,
piece

friend
,
all
their
devices
for
cheapening
labour
simply
resulted
in
increasing
the
burden
of
labour
.
the
appetite
of
the
world
-
market
grew
with
what
it
fed
on
:
the
countries
within
the
ring
of
'
civilisation
'
(
that
is
,
organised
misery
)
were
glutted
with
the
abortions
of
the
market
,
and
force
and
fraud
were
used
unsparingly
to
'
open
up
'
countries
outside
that
pale
.
this
process
of
'
opening
up
'
is
a
strange
one
to
those
who
have
read
the
professions
of
the
men
of
that
period
and
do
not
understand
their
practice
;
and
perhaps
shows
us
at
its
worst
the
great
vice
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
the
use
of
hypocrisy
and
cant
to
evade
the
responsibility
of
vicarious
ferocity
.
when
the
civilised
world
-
market
coveted
a
country
not
yet
in
its
clutches
,
some
transparent
pretext
was
found
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
suppression
of
a
slavery
different
from
and
not
so
cruel
as
that
of
commerce
;
the
pushing
of
a
religion
no
longer
believed
in
by
its
promoters
;
the
'
rescue
'
of
some
desperado
or
homicidal
madman
whose
misdeeds
had
got
him
into
trouble

the

.
.
.
any

,
which
would
beat
the

.
then
some
bold
,
unprincipled
,
ignorant
adventurer
was
found
(
no
difficult
task
in
the
days
of
competition
)
,
and
he
was
bribed
to
'
create
a
market
'
by
breaking
up
whatever
traditional
society
there
might
be
in
the
doomed
country
,
and
by
destroying
whatever
leisure
or
pleasure
he
found
there
.
he
forced
wares
on
the
natives
which
they
did
not
want
,
and
took
their
natural
products
in
'
exchange
,
'
as
this
form
of
robbery
was
called
,
and
thereby
he
'
created
new
wants
,
'
to
supply
which
(
that
is
,
to
be
allowed
to
live

their
new
masters

the
hapless
,
helpless
people
had
to
sell
themselves
into
the
slavery
of
hopeless
toil

that
they
might
have
something
wherewith
to

"
said
the
old
man
crustily
,
for
he
was
rather
peevish
at
being
cut
short
in
his
story
;
"
how
could
they
possibly
attend
to
such
trifles
as
the
quality
of
the
wares
they
sold
?
the
best
of
them
were
of
a
lowish
average

the
worst
were

for

which
nobody
would
have
put
up
with
if
they
could
have
got
anything
else

it
was
a
current
jest
of
the
time
that
the
wares
were
made
to
sell
and
not
to
use
;
a
jest
which
you
,
as
coming
from
another
planet
,
may
understand
,
but
which
our
folk
could
not
.
"
said
i
:
"
what
!
did
they
make
nothing
well
?
"
"
why
,
yes
,
"
said
he
,
"
there
was
one
class
of
goods
which
they
did
make
thoroughly
well
,
and
that
was
the
class
of
machines
which
were
used
for
making
things
.
these
were
usually
quite
perfect
pieces
of
workmanship
,
admirably
adapted
to
the
end
in
view
.
so
that
it
may
be
fairly
said
that
the
great
achievement
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
the
making
of
machines
which
were
wonders
of
invention
,
skill
,
and
patience
,
and
which
were
used
for
the
production
of
measureless
quantities
of
worthless
make
-
shifts
.
in
truth
,
the
owners
of
the
machines
did
not
consider
anything
which
they
made
as
wares
,
but
simply
as
means
for
the
enrichment
of
themselves
.
of
course
the
only
admitted
test
of
utility
in
wares
was
the
finding
of
buyers
for
them
-
-
wise
men
or
fools
,
as
it
might
chance
.

"

then
the
overturn
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
smiling
,
"
and
the
nineteenth
century
saw
itself
as
a
man
who
has
lost
his
clothes

bathing
,

has
to
walk
naked
through
the
town

"
"
you

very
bitter
about
that
unlucky
nineteenth

i
.
"
naturally
,
"
said
he
,
"
since
i
know
so
much
about
it
.
"
he
was
silent
a
little
,
and
then
said
:
"
there
are
traditions

.
.
.
.
.
.
nay
,
real
histories
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
our
family
about
it
:
my
grandfather
was
one
of
its
victims
.
if
you
know
something
about
it
,
you
will
understand
what
he
suffered
when
i
tell
you
that
he
was
in
those
days
a
genuine
artist
,
a
man
of
genius
,
and
a
revolutionist
.
"
"
i
think
i
do
understand
,
"
said
i
:
"
but
now
,
as
it
seems
,
you
have
reversed
all
this
?
"
"
pretty
much
so
,
"
said
he
.
"
the
wares
which
we
make
are
made
because
they
are
needed
:
men
make
for
their
neighbours
'
use
as
if
they
were
making
for
themselves
,
not
for
a
vague
market
of
which
they
know
nothing
,
and
over
which
they
have
no
control
:
as
there
is
no
buying
and
selling
,
it
would
be
mere
insanity
to
make
goods
on
the
chance
of
their
being
wanted
;
for
there
is
no
longer
anyone
who
can
be
compelled
to
buy
them
.
so
that
whatever
is
made
is
good
,
and
thoroughly
fit
for
its
purpose
.
nothing
can
be
made
except
for
genuine
use
;
therefore
no
inferior
goods
are
made
.
moreover
,
as
aforesaid
,
we
have
now
found
out
what
we
want
,
so
we
make
no
more
than
we
want
;
and
as
we
are
not
driven
to
make
a
vast
quantity
of
useless
things
we
have
time
and
resources
enough
to
consider
our
pleasure
in
making
them
.
all
work
which
would
be
irksome
to
do
by
hand
is
done
by
immensely
improved
machinery
;
and
in
all
work
which
it
is
a
pleasure
to
do
by
hand
machinery
is
done
without
.
there
is
no
difficulty
in
finding
work
which
suits
the
special
turn
of
mind
of
everybody
;
so
that
no
man
is
sacrificed
to
the
wants
of
another
.
from
time
to
time
,
when
we
have
found
out
that
some
piece
of
work
was
too
disagreeable
or
troublesome
,
we
have
given
it
up
and
done
altogether
without
the
thing
produced
by
it
.
now
,
surely
you
can
see
that
under
these
circumstances
all
the
work
that
we
do
is
an
exercise
of
the
mind
and
body
more
or
less
pleasant
to
be
done
:
so
that
instead
of
avoiding
work
everybody
seeks
it
:
and
,
since
people
have
got
defter
in
doing
the
work
generation
after
generation
,
it
has
become
so
easy
to
do
,
that
it
seems
as
if
there
were
less
done
,
though
probably
more
is
produced
.
i
suppose
this
explains
that
fear
,
which
i
hinted
at
just
now
,
of
a
possible
scarcity
in
work
,
which
perhaps
you
have
already
noticed
,
and
which
is
a
feeling
on
the
increase
,
and
has
been
for
a
score
of
years
.
"
"
but
do
you
think
,
"
said
i
,
"
that
there
is
any
fear
of
a
work
-
famine
amongst
you
?
"
"
no
,
i
do
not
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
i
will
tell
why
;
it
is
each
man
'
s
business
to
make
his
own
work
pleasanter
and
pleasanter
,
which
of
course
tends
towards
raising
the
standard
of
excellence
,
as
no
man
enjoys
turning
out
work
which
is
not
a
credit
to
him
,
and
also
to
greater
deliberation
in
turning
it
out
;
and
there
is
such
a
vast
number
of
things
which
can
be
treated
as
works
of
art
,
that
this
alone
gives
employment
to
a
host
of
deft
people
.
again
,
if
art
be
inexhaustible
,
so
is
science
also
;
and
though
it
is
no
longer
the
only
innocent
occupation
which
is
thought
worth
an
intelligent
man
spending
his
time
upon
,
as
it
once
was
,
yet
there
are
,
and
i
suppose
will
be
,
many
people
who
are
excited
by
its
conquest
of
difficulties
,
and
care
for
it
more
than
for
anything
else
.
again
,
as
more
and
more
of
pleasure
is
imported
into
work
,
i
think
we
shall
take
up
kinds
of
work
which
produce
desirable
wares
,
but
which
we
gave
up
because
we
could
not
carry
them
on
pleasantly
.
moreover
,
i
think
that
it
is
only
in
parts
of
europe
which
are
more
advanced
than
the
rest
of
the
world
that
you
will
hear
this
talk
of
the
fear
of
a
work
-
famine
.
those
lands
which
were
once
the
colonies
of
great
britain
,
for
instance
,
and
especially
america
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
part
of
it
,
above
all
,
which
was
once
the
united
states
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
are
now
and
will
be
for
a
long
while
a
great
resource
to
us
.
for
these
lands
,
and
,
i
say
,
especially
the
northern
parts
of
america
,
suffered
so
terribly
from
the
full
force
of
the
last
days
of
civilisation
,
and
became
such
horrible
places
to
live
in
,
that
they
are
now
very
backward
in
all
that
makes
life
pleasant
.
indeed
,
one
may
say
that
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
the
people
of
the
northern
parts
of
america
have
been
engaged
in
gradually
making
a
dwelling
-
place
out
of
a
stinking
dust
-
heap
;
and
there
is
still
a
great
deal
to
do
,
especially
as
the
country
is
so
big
.
"
"
well
,
"
said
i
,
"
i
am
exceedingly
glad
to
think
that
you
have
such
a
prospect
of
happiness
before
you
.
but
i
should
like
to
ask
a
few
more
questions
,
and
then
i
have
done
for
to
-
day
.
"
as
i
spoke
,
i
heard
footsteps
near
the
door
;
the
latch
yielded
,
and
in
came
our
two
lovers
,
looking
so
handsome
that
one
had
no
feeling
of
shame
in
looking
on
at
their
little
-
concealed
love
-
making
;
for
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
world
must
be
in
love
with
them
.
as
for
old
hammond
,
he
looked
on
them
like
an
artist
who
has
just
painted
a
picture
nearly
as
well
as
he
thought
he
could
when
he
began
it
,
and
was
perfectly
happy
.
he
said
:
"
sit
down
,
sit
down
,
young
folk
,
and
do
not
make
a
noise
.
our
guest
here
has
still
some
questions
to
ask
me
.
"
"
well
,
i
should
suppose
so
,
"
said
dick
;
"
you
have
only
been
three
hours
and
a
half
together
;
and
it
is
not
to
be
hoped
that
the
history
of
two
centuries
could
be
told
in
three
hours
and
a
half
:
let
alone
that
,
for
all
i
know
,
you
may
have
been
wandering
into
the
realms
of
geography
and
craftsmanship
.
"
"
as
to
noise
,
my
dear
kinsman
,
"
said
clara
,
"
you
will
very
soon
be
disturbed
by
the
noise
of
the
dinner
-
bell
,
which
i
should
think
will
be
very
pleasant
music
to
our
guest
,
who
breakfasted
early
,
it
seems
,
and
probably
had
a
tiring
day
yesterday
.
"
i
said
:
"
well
,
since
you
have
spoken
the
word
,
i
begin
to
feel
that
it
is
so
;
but
i
have
been
feeding
myself
with
wonder
this
long
time
past
:
really
,
it
is
quite
true
,
"
quoth
i
,
as
i
saw
her
smile
,
o
so
prettily
!
but
just
then
from
some
tower
high
up
in
the
air
came
the
sound
of
silvery
chimes
playing
a
sweet
clear
tune
,
that
sounded
to
my
unaccustomed
ears
like
the
song
of
the
first
blackbird
in
the
spring
,
and
called
a
rush
of
memories
to
my
mind
,
some
of
bad
times
,
some
of
good
,
but
all
sweetened
now
into
mere
pleasure
.
"
no
more
questions
now
before
dinner
,
"
said
clara
;
and
she
took
my
hand
as
an
affectionate
child
would
,
and
led
me
out
of
the
room
and
down
stairs
into
the
forecourt
of
the
museum
,
leaving
the
two
hammonds
to
follow
as
they
pleased
.
we
went
into
the
market
-
place
which
i
had
been
in
before
,
a
thinnish
stream
of
elegantly
{
1
}
dressed
people
going
in
along
with
us
.
we
turned
into
the
cloister
and
came
to
a
richly
moulded
and
carved
doorway
,
where
a
very
pretty
dark
-
haired
young
girl
gave
us
each
a
beautiful
bunch
of
summer
flowers
,
and
we
entered
a
hall
much
bigger
than
that
of
the
hammersmith
guest
house
,
more
elaborate
in
its
architecture
and
perhaps
more
beautiful
.
i
found
it
difficult
to
keep
my
eyes
off
the
wall
-
pictures
(
for
i
thought
it
bad
manners
to
stare
at
clara
all
the
time
,
though
she
was
quite
worth
it
)
.
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
their
subjects
were
taken
from
queer
old
-
world
myths
and
imaginations
which
in
yesterday
'
s
world
only
about
half
a
dozen
people
in
the
country
knew
anything
about
;
and
when
the
two
hammonds
sat
down
opposite
to
us
,
i
said
to
the
old
man
,
pointing
to
the
frieze
:
"
how
strange
to
see
such
subjects
here
!
"
"
why
?
"
said
he
.
"
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
be
surprised
;
everybody
knows
the
tales
;
and
they
are
graceful
and
pleasant
subjects
,
not
too
tragic
for
a
place
where
people
mostly
eat
and
drink
and
amuse
themselves
,
and
yet
full
of
incident
.
"
i
smiled
,
and
said
:
"
well
,
i
scarcely
expected
to
find
record
of
the
seven
swans
and
the
king
of
the
golden
mountain
and
faithful
henry
,
and
such
curious
pleasant
imaginations
as
jacob
grimm
got
together
from
the
childhood
of
the
world
,
barely
lingering
even
in
his
time
:
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
forgotten
such
childishness
by
this
time
.
"
the
old
man
smiled
,
and
said
nothing
;
but
dick
turned
rather
red
,
and
broke
out
:
"
what
do
you
mean
,
guest
?
i
think
them
very
beautiful
,
i
mean
not
only
the
pictures
,
but
the
stories
;
and
when
we
were
children
we
used
to
imagine
them
going
on
in
every
wood
-
end
,
by
the
bight
of
every
stream
:
every
house
in
the
fields
was
the
fairyland
king
'
s
house
to
us
.
do
not
you
remember
,
clara
?
"
"
yes
,
"
she
said
;
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
a
slight
cloud
came
over
her
fair
face
.
i
was
going
to
speak
to
her
on
the
subject
,
when
the
pretty
waitresses
came
to
us
smiling
,
and
chattering
sweetly
like
reed
warblers
by
the
river
side
,
and
fell
to
giving
us
our
dinner
.
as
to
this
,
as
at
our
breakfast
,
everything
was
cooked
and
served
with
a
daintiness
which
showed
that
those
who
had
prepared
it
were
interested
in
it
;
but
there
was
no
excess
either
of
quantity
or
of
gourmandise
;
everything
was
simple
,
though
so
excellent
of
its
kind
;
and
it
was
made
clear
to
us
that
this
was
no
feast
,
only
an
ordinary
meal
.
the
glass
,
crockery
,
and
plate
were
very
beautiful
to
my
eyes
,
used
to
the
study
of
mediaeval
art
;
but
a
nineteenth
-
century
club
-
haunter
would
,
i
daresay
,
have
found
them
rough
and
lacking
in
finish
;
the
crockery
being
lead
-
glazed
pot
-
ware
,
though
beautifully
ornamented
;
the
only
porcelain
being
here
and
there
a
piece
of
old
oriental
ware
.
the
glass
,
again
,
though
elegant
and
quaint
,
and
very
varied
in
form
,
was
somewhat
bubbled
and
hornier
in
texture
than
the
commercial
articles
of
the
nineteenth
century
.
the
furniture
and
general
fittings
of
the
ball
were
much
of
a
piece
with
the
table
-
gear
,
beautiful
in
form
and
highly
ornamented
,
but
without
the
commercial
"
finish
"
of
the
joiners
and
cabinet
-
makers
of
our
time
.
withal
,
there
was
a
total
absence
of
what
the
nineteenth
century
calls
"
comfort
"
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
is
,
stuffy
inconvenience
;
so
that
,
even
apart
from
the
delightful
excitement
of
the
day
,
i
had
never
eaten
my
dinner
so
pleasantly
before
.
when
we
had
done
eating
,
and
were
sitting
a
little
while
,
with
a
bottle
of
very
good
bordeaux
wine
before
us
,
clara
came
back
to
the
question
of
the
subject
-
matter
of
the
pictures
,
as
though
it
had
troubled
her
.
she
looked
up
at
them
,
and
said
:
"
how
is
it
that
though
we
are
so
interested
with
our
life
for
the
most
part
,
yet
when
people
take
to
writing
poems
or
painting
pictures
they
seldom
deal
with
our
modern
life
,
or
if
they
do
,
take
good
care
to
make
their
poems
or
pictures
unlike
that
life
?
are
we
not
good
enough
to
paint
ourselves
?
how
is
it
that
we
find
the
dreadful
times
of
the
past
so
interesting
to
us
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
pictures
and
poetry
?
"
old
hammond
smiled
.
"
it
always
was
so
,
and
i
suppose
always
will
be
,
"
said
he
,
"
however
it
may
be
explained
.
it
is
true
that
in
the
nineteenth
century
,
when
there
was
so
little
art
and
so
much
talk
about
it
,
there
was
a
theory
that
art
and
imaginative
literature
ought
to
deal
with
contemporary
life
;
but
they
never
did
so
;
for
,
if
there
was
any
pretence
of
it
,
the
author
always
took
care
(
as
clara
hinted
just
now
)
to
disguise
,
or
exaggerate
,
or
idealise
,
and
in
some
way
or
another
make
it
strange
;
so
that
,
for
all
the
verisimilitude
there
was
,
he
might
just
as
well
have
dealt
with
the
times
of
the
pharaohs
.
"
"
well
,
"
said
dick
,
"
surely
it
is
but
natural
to
like
these
things
strange
;
just
as
when
we
were
children
,
as
i
said
just
now
,
we
used
to
pretend
to
be
so
-
and
-
so
in
such
-
and
-
such
a
place
.
that
'
s
what
these
pictures
and
poems
do
;
and
why
should
not
they
?
"
"

hast
hit
it

quoth
old
hammond
;
"
it
is
the
child
-
like
part
of
us
that
produces
works
of
imagination
.
when
we
are
children
time
passes
so
slow
with
us
that
we
seem
to
have
time
for
everything
.
"
he
sighed
,
and
then
smiled
and
said
:
"
at
least
let
us
rejoice
that
we
have
got
back
our
childhood
again
.
i
drink
to
the
days
that

"

said
i
in
a
low
voice
,
and
then
blushed
at
my
double
rudeness
,
and
hoped
that
he
had
not
heard
.
but
he
had
,
and
turned
to
me
smiling
,
and
said
:
"
yes

why
not

and
for
my
part

i
hope
it
may
last
long

that

and
unhappy

dick
answered
her
with
some
lover
'

speech
,
impossible
to
be
written
down
,
and
then
we
sat
quiet
a
little
.
dick
broke
the
silence
at
last
,
saying
:

you

with

some
welsh
folk
sing
in

you

"
"

said
i
,
"
as
i

must
let

in
point
of
fact
,
i
did
not
by
any
means
want
to
be
'
amused
'
just
then
;

also
i
rather
felt
as
if
the
old
man
,
with
his
knowledge
of
past
times
,
and
even
a
kind
of
inverted
sympathy
for
them
caused
by
his
active
hatred
of
them
,
was
as
it
were
a
blanket
for
me
against
the
cold
of
this
very
new
world
,
where
i
was
,
so
to
say
,
stripped
bare
of
every
habitual
thought
and
way
of
acting
;
and
i
did
not
want
to
leave
him
too
soon
.
he
came
to
my
rescue
at
once
,
and
said
-
"
wait
a
bit
,

;
there
is
someone
else
to
be
consulted
besides
you

here

that
is
i

i
am
not
going
to
lose
the
pleasure
of
his
company
just
now

as
i
know
he
has
something
else
to
ask
me

go
to
your
welshmen
,
by
all
means
;

first
of
all
bring
us
another
bottle
of
wine
to
this
nook
,
and
then
be
off
as
soon
as
you
like
;
and

again
and
fetch
our
friend
to
go
westward

too
soon

"
dick
nodded
smilingly
,
and
the
old
man
and
i
were
soon
alone
in
the
great
hall
,
the
afternoon
sun
gleaming
on
the
red
wine
in
our
tall
quaint

shaped
glasses
.
then
said
hammond
:

said
i

"
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
the
history
of
the
terrible
period
of
transition
from
commercial
slavery
to
freedom
may
thus
be
summarised
.
when
the
hope
of
realising
a
communal
condition
of
life
for
all
men
arose
,
quite
late
in
the
nineteenth
century
,
the
power
of
the
middle
classes
,
the
then
tyrants
of
society
,
was
so
enormous
and
crushing
,
that
to
almost
all
men
,
even
those
who
had
,
you
may
say
despite
themselves
,
despite
their
reason
and
judgment
,
conceived
such
hopes
,
it
seemed
a
dream
.
so
much
was
this
the
case
that
some
of
those
more
enlightened
men
who
were
then
called
socialists
,
although
they
well
knew
,
and
even
stated
in
public
,
that
the
only
reasonable
condition
of
society
was
that
of
pure
communism
(
such
as
you
now
see
around
you
)
,
yet
shrunk
from
what
seemed
to
them
the
barren
task
of
preaching
the
realisation
of
a
happy
dream
.
looking
back
now
,
we
can
see
that
the
great
motive
-
power
of
the
change
was
a
longing
for
freedom
and
equality
,
akin
if
you
please
to
the
unreasonable
passion
of
the
lover
;
a
sickness
of
heart
that
rejected
with
loathing
the
aimless
solitary
life
of
the
well
-
to
-
do
educated
man
of
that
time
:
phrases
,
my
dear
friend
,
which
have
lost
their
meaning
to
us
of
the
present
day
;
so
far
removed
we
are
from
the
dreadful
facts
which
they
represent
.
"
well
,
these
men
,
though
conscious
of
this
feeling
,
had
no
faith
in
it
,
as
a
means
of
bringing
about
the
change
.
nor
was
that
wonderful
:
for
looking
around
them
they
saw
the
huge
mass
of
the
oppressed
classes
too
much
burdened
with
the
misery
of
their
lives
,
and
too
much
overwhelmed
by
the
selfishness
of
misery
,
to
be
able
to
form
a
conception
of
any
escape
from
it
except
by
the
ordinary
way
prescribed
by
the
system
of
slavery
under
which
they
lived
;
which
was
nothing
more
than
a
remote
chance
of
climbing
out
of
the
oppressed
into
the
oppressing
class
.
"
therefore
,
though
they
knew
that
the
only
reasonable
aim
for
those
who
would
better
the
world
was
a
condition
of
equality
;
in
their
impatience
and
despair
they
managed
to
convince
themselves
that
if
they
could
by
hook
or
by
crook
get
the
machinery
of
production
and
the
management
of
property
so
altered
that
the
'
lower
classes
'
(
so
the
horrible
word
ran
)
might
have
their
slavery
somewhat
ameliorated
,
they
would
be
ready
to
fit
into
this
machinery
,
and
would
use
it
for
bettering
their
condition
still
more
and
still
more
,
until
at
last
the
result
would
be
a
practical
equality
(
they
were
very
fond
of
using
the
word
'
practical
'
)
,
because
'
the
rich
'
would
be
forced
to
pay
so
much
for
keeping
'
the
poor
'
in
a
tolerable
condition
that
the
condition
of
riches
would
become
no
longer
valuable
and
would
gradually
die
out
.
do
you
follow
me
?
"
"
partly
,
"
said
i
.
"

on

"
said
old
hammond
:
"
well
,
since

,
you
will
see
that

a
theory
this

altogether
unreasonable
;

'

,

it

a

"
said
i
.
"
well
,
do
not
you
see
,
"
said
he
,
"
because
it
involved
the
making
of
a
machinery
by
those
who
did
not
know
what
they
wanted
the
machines
to
do
.
so
far
as
the
masses
of
the
oppressed
class
furthered
this
scheme
of
improvement
,
they
did
it
to
get
themselves
improved
slave
-
rations
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
many
of
them
as
could
.
and
if
those
classes
had
really
been
incapable
of
being
touched
by
that
instinct
which
produced
the
passion
for
freedom
and
equality
aforesaid
,
what
would
have
happened
,
i
think
,
would
have
been
this
:
that
a
certain
part
of
the
working
classes
would
have
been
so
far
improved
in
condition
that
they
would
have
approached
the
condition
of
the
middling
rich
men
;
but
below
them
would
have
been
a
great
class
of
most
miserable
slaves
,
whose
slavery
would
have
been
far
more
hopeless
than
the
older
class
-
slavery
had
been
.
"
"
what
stood
in
the
way
of
this
?
"
said
i
.
"
'
why
,
of
course
,
"
said
he
,
"
just
that
instinct
for
freedom
aforesaid
.
it
is
true
that
the
slave
-
class
could
not
conceive
the
happiness
of
a
free
life
.
yet
they
grew
to
understand
(
and
very
speedily
too
)
that
they
were
oppressed
by
their
masters
,
and
they
assumed
,
you
see
how
justly
,
that
they
could
do
without
them
,
though
perhaps
they
scarce
knew
how
;
so
that
it
came
to
this
,
that
though
they
could
not
look
forward
to
the
happiness
or
peace
of
the
freeman
,
they
did
at
least
look
forward
to
the
war
which
a
vague
hope
told
them
would
bring
that
peace
about
.
"
"
could
you
tell
me
rather
more
closely
what
actually
took
place
?
"
said
i
;
for
i
thought
him
rather
vague
here
.
"
yes
,
"
he
said
,
"
i
can
.
that
machinery
of
life
for
the
use
of
people
who
did
not
know
what
they
wanted
of
it
,
and
which
was
known
at
the
time
as
state
socialism
,
was
partly
put
in
motion
,
though
in
a
very
piecemeal
way
.
but
it
did
not
work
smoothly
;
it
was
,
of
course
,
resisted
at
every
turn
by
the
capitalists
;
and
no
wonder
,
for
it
tended
more
and
more
to
upset
the
commercial
system
i
have
told
you
of
;
without
providing
anything
really
effective
in
its
place
.
the
result
was
growing
confusion
,
great
suffering
amongst
the
working
classes
,
and
,
as
a
consequence
,
great
discontent
.
for
a
long
time
matters
went
on
like
this
.
the
power
of
the
upper
classes
had
lessened
,
as
their
command
over
wealth
lessened
,
and
they
could
not
carry
things
wholly
by
the
high
hand
as
they
had
been
used
to
in
earlier
days
.
so
far
the
state
socialists
were
justified
by
the
result
.
on
the
other
hand
,
the
working
classes
were
ill
-
organised
,
and
growing
poorer
in
reality
,
in
spite
of
the
gains
(
also
real
in
the
long
run
)
which
they
had
forced
from
the
masters
.
thus
matters
hung
in
the
balance
;
the
masters
could
not
reduce
their
slaves
to
complete
subjection
,
though
they
put
down
some
feeble
and
partial
riots
easily
enough
.
the
workers
forced
their
masters
to
grant
them
ameliorations
,
real
or
imaginary
,
of
their
condition
,
but
could
not
force
freedom
from
them
.
at
last
came
a
great
crash
.
to
explain
this
you
must
understand
that
very
great
progress
had
been
made
amongst
the
workers
,
though
as
before
said
but
little
in
the
direction
of
improved
livelihood
.
"
i
played
the
innocent
and
said
:
"
in
what
direction
could
they
improve
,
if
not
in
livelihood
?
"
said
he
:
"
in
the
power
to
bring
about
a
state
of
things
in
which
livelihood
would
be
full
,
and
easy
to
gain
.
they
had
at
last
learned
how
to
combine
after
a
long
period
of
mistakes
and
disasters
.
the
workmen
had
now
a
regular
organization
in
the
struggle
against
their
masters
,
a
struggle
which
for
more
than
half
a
century
had
been
accepted
as
an
inevitable
part
of
the
conditions
of
the
modern
system
of
labour
and
production
.
this
combination
had
now
taken
the
form
of
a
federation
of
all
or
almost
all
the
recognised
wage
-
paid
employments
,
and
it
was
by
its
means
that
those
betterments
of
the
conditions
of
the
workmen
had
been
forced
from
the
masters
:
and
though
they
were
not
seldom
mixed
up
with
the
rioting
that
happened
,
especially
in
the
earlier
days
of
their
organization
,
it
by
no
means
formed
an
essential
part
of
their
tactics
;
indeed
at
the
time
i
am
now
speaking
of
they
had
got
to
be
so
strong
that
most
commonly
the
mere
threat
of
a
'
strike
'
was
enough
to
gain
any
minor
point
:
because
they
had
given
up
the
foolish
tactics
of
the
ancient
trades
unions
of
calling
out
of
work
a
part
only
of
the
workers
of
such
and
such
an
industry
,
and
supporting
them
while
out
of
work
on
the
labour
of
those
that
remained
in
.
by
this
time
they
had
a
biggish
fund
of
money
for
the
support
of
strikes
,
and
could
stop
a
certain
industry
altogether
for
a
time
if
they
so
determined
.
"
said
i
:
"
was
there
not
a
serious
danger
of
such
moneys
being
misused
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
of
jobbery
,
in
fact
?
"
old
hammond
wriggled
uneasily
on
his
seat
,
and
said
:
"
though
all
this
happened
so
long
ago
,
i
still
feel
the
pain
of
mere
shame
when
i
have
to
tell
you
that
it
was
more
than
a
danger
:
that
such
rascality
often
happened
;
indeed
more
than
once
the
whole
combination
seemed
dropping
to
pieces
because
of
it
:
but
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
telling
,
things
looked
so
threatening
,
and
to
the
workmen
at
least
the
necessity
of
their
dealing
with
the
fast
-
gathering
trouble
which
the
labour
-
struggle
had
brought
about
,
was
so
clear
,
that
the
conditions
of
the
times
had
begot
a
deep
seriousness
amongst
all
reasonable
people
;
a
determination
which
put
aside
all
non
-
essentials
,
and
which
to
thinking
men
was
ominous
of
the
swiftly
-
approaching
change
:
such
an
element
was
too
dangerous
for
mere
traitors
and
self
-
seekers
,
and
one
by
one
they
were
thrust
out
and
mostly
joined
the
declared
reactionaries
.

of

of

practical

yielded
by
the
masters

direct
compulsion

men

the
new

by
no

cry
arose
for
compelling
the
masters
to
employ
their
men
a
less
number
of
hours
in
the
day
:
this
cry
gathered
volume
quickly
,
and
the
masters
had
to
yield
to
it
.
but
it
was
,
of
course
,
clear
that
unless
this
meant
a
higher
price
for
work
per
hour
,
it
would
be
a
mere
nullity
,
and
that
the
masters
,
unless
forced
,
would
reduce
it
to
that
.
therefore
after
a
long
struggle
another
law
was
passed
fixing
a
minimum
price
for
labour
in
the
most
important
industries
;
which
again
had
to
be
supplemented
by
a
law
fixing
the
maximum
price
on
the
chief
wares
then
considered
necessary
for
a
workman
'
s
life
.
"
"
you
were
getting
perilously
near
to
the
late
roman
poor
-
rates
,
"
said
i
,
smiling
,
"
and
the
doling
out
of
bread
to
the
proletariat
.
"
"
so
many
said
at
the
time
,
"
said
the
old
man
drily
;
"
and
it
has
long
been
a
commonplace
that
that
slough
awaits
state
socialism
in
the
end
,
if
it
gets
to
the
end
,
which
as
you
know
it
did
not
with
us
.
however
it
went
further
than
this
minimum
and
maximum
business
,
which
by
the
by
we
can
now
see
was
necessary
.
the
government
now
found
it
imperative
on
them
to
meet
the
outcry
of
the
master
class
at
the
approaching
destruction
of
commerce
(
as
desirable
,
had
they
known
it
,
as
the
extinction
of
the
cholera
,
which
has
since
happily
taken
place
)
.
and
they
were
forced
to
meet
it
by
a
measure
hostile
to
the
masters
,
the
establishment
of
government
factories
for
the
production
of
necessary
wares
,
and
markets
for
their
sale
.
these
measures
taken
altogether
did
do
something
:
they
were
in
fact
of
the
nature
of
regulations
made
by
the
commander
of
a
beleaguered
city
.
but
of
course
to
the
privileged
classes
it
seemed
as
if
the
end
of
the
world
were
come
when
such
laws
were
enacted
.
"
nor
was
that
altogether
without
a
warrant
:
the
spread
of
communistic
theories
,
and
the
partial
practice
of
state
socialism
had
at
first
disturbed
,
and
at
last
almost
paralysed
the
marvellous
system
of
commerce
under
which
the
old
world
had
lived
so
feverishly
,
and
had
produced
for
some
few
a
life
of
gambler
'
s
pleasure
,
and
for
many
,
or
most
,
a
life
of
mere
misery
:
over
and
over
again
came
'
bad
times
'
as
they
were
called
,
and
indeed
they
were
bad
enough
for
the
wage
-
slaves
.
the
year
1952
was
one
of
the
worst
of
these
times
;
the
workmen
suffered
dreadfully
:
the
partial
,
inefficient
government
factories
,
which
were
terribly
jobbed
,
all
but
broke
down
,
and
a
vast
part
of
the
population
had
for
the
time
being
to
be
fed
on
undisguised
"
charity
"
as
it
was
called
.
"
the
combined
workers
watched
the
situation
with
mingled
hope
and
anxiety
.
they
had
already
formulated
their
general
demands
;
but
now
by
a
solemn
and
universal
vote
of
the
whole
of
their
federated
societies
,
they
insisted
on
the
first
step
being
taken
toward
carrying
out
their
demands
:
this
step
would
have
led
directly
to
handing
over
the
management
of
the
whole
natural
resources
of
the
country
,
together
with
the
machinery
for
using
them
into
the
power
of
the
combined
workers
,
and
the
reduction
of
the
privileged
classes
into
the
position
of
pensioners
obviously
dependent
on
the
pleasure
of
the
workers
.
the
'
resolution
,
'
as
it
was
called
,
which
was
widely
published
in
the
newspapers
of
the
day
,
was
in
fact
a
declaration
of
war
,
and
was
so
accepted
by
the
master
class
.
they
began
henceforward
to
prepare
for
a
firm
stand
against
the
'
brutal
and
ferocious
communism
of
the
day
,
'
as
they
phrased
it
.
and
as
they
were
in
many
ways
still
very
powerful
,
or
seemed
so
to
be
;
they
still
hoped
by
means
of
brute
force
to
regain
some
of
what
they
had
lost
,
and
perhaps
in
the
end
the
whole
of
it
.
it
was
said
amongst
them
on
all
hands
that
it
had
been
a
great
mistake
of
the
various
governments
not
to
have
resisted
sooner
;
and
the
liberals
and
radicals
(
the
name
as
perhaps
you
may
know
of
the
more
democratically
inclined
part
of
the
ruling
classes
)
were
much
blamed
for
having
led
the
world
to
this
pass
by
their
mis
-
timed
pedantry
and
foolish
sentimentality
:
and
one
gladstone
,
or
gledstein
(
probably
,
judging
by
this
name
,
of
scandinavian
descent
)
,
a
notable
politician
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
was
especially
singled
out
for
reprobation
in
this
respect
.
i
need
scarcely
point
out
to
you
the
absurdity
of
all
this
.
but
terrible
tragedy
lay
hidden
behind
this
grinning
through
a
horse
-
collar
of
the
reactionary
party
.
'
the
insatiable
greed
of
the
lower
classes
must
be
repressed
'
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
'
the
people
must
be
taught
a
lesson
'
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
these
were
the
sacramental
phrases
current
amongst
the
reactionists
,
and
ominous
enough
they
were
.
"
the
old
man
stopped
to
look
keenly
at
my
attentive
and
wondering
face
;
and
then
said
:
"
i
know
,
dear
guest
,
that
i
have
been
using
words
and
phrases
which
few
people
amongst
us
could
understand
without
long
and
laborious
explanation
;
and
not
even
then
perhaps
.
but
since
you
have
not
yet
gone
to
sleep
,
and
since
i
am
speaking
to
you
as
to
a
being
from
another
planet
,
i
may
venture
to
ask
you
if
you
have
followed
me
thus
far
?
"
"
o
yes
,
"
said
i
,
"
i
quite
understand
:
pray
go
on
;
a
great
deal
of
what
you
have
been
saying
was
common
place
with
us
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
when
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
when
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
yes
,
"
said
he
gravely
,
"
when
you
were
dwelling
in
the
other
planet
.
well
,
now
for
the
crash
aforesaid
.
"
on
some
comparatively
trifling
occasion
a
great
meeting
was
summoned
by
the
workmen
leaders
to
meet
in
trafalgar
square
(
about
the
right
to
meet
in
which
place
there
had
for
years
and
years
been
bickering
)
.
the
civic
bourgeois
guard
(
called
the
police
)
attacked
the
said
meeting
with
bludgeons
,
according
to
their
custom
;
many
people
were
hurt
in
the
melee
,
of
whom
five
in
all
died
,
either
trampled
to
death
on
the
spot
,
or
from
the
effects
of
their
cudgelling
;
the
meeting
was
scattered
,
and
some
hundred
of
prisoners
cast
into
gaol
.
a
similar
meeting
had
been
treated
in
the
same
way
a
few
days
before
at
a
place
called
manchester
,
which
has
now
disappeared
.
thus
the
'
lesson
'
began
.
the
whole
country
was
thrown
into
a
ferment
by
this
;
meetings
were
held
which
attempted
some
rough
organisation
for
the
holding
of
another
meeting
to
retort
on
the
authorities
.
a
huge
crowd
assembled
in
trafalgar
square
and
the
neighbourhood
(
then
a
place
of
crowded
streets
)
,
and
was
too
big
for
the
bludgeon
-
armed
police
to
cope
with
;
there
was
a
good
deal
of
dry
-
blow
fighting
;
three
or
four
of
the
people
were
killed
,
and
half
a
score
of
policemen
were
crushed
to
death
in
the
throng
,
and
the
rest
got
away
as
they
could
.
this
was
a
victory
for
the
people
as
far
as
it
went
.
the
next
day
all
london
(
remember
what
it
was
in
those
days
)
was
in
a
state
of
turmoil
.
many
of
the
rich
fled
into
the
country
;
the
executive
got
together
soldiery
,
but
did
not
dare
to
use
them
;
and
the
police
could
not
be
massed
in
any
one
place
,
because
riots
or
threats
of
riots
were
everywhere
.
but
in
manchester
,
where
the
people
were
not
so
courageous
or
not
so
desperate
as
in
london
,
several
of
the
popular
leaders
were
arrested
.
in
london
a
convention
of
leaders
was
got
together
from
the
federation
of
combined
workmen
,
and
sat
under
the
old
revolutionary
name
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
;
but
as
they
had
no
drilled
and
armed
body
of
men
to
direct
,
they
attempted
no
aggressive
measures
,
but
only
placarded
the
walls
with
somewhat
vague
appeals
to
the
workmen
not
to
allow
themselves
to
be
trampled
upon
.
however
,
they
called
a
meeting
in
trafalgar
square
for
the
day
fortnight
of
the
last
-
mentioned
skirmish
.
"
meantime
the
town
grew
no
quieter
,
and
business
came
pretty
much
to
an
end
.
the
newspapers
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
then
,
as
always
hitherto
,
almost
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
masters
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
clamoured
to
the
government
for
repressive
measures
;
the
rich
citizens
were
enrolled
as
an
extra
body
of
police
,
and
armed
with
bludgeons
like
them
;
many
of
these
were
strong
,
well
-
fed
,
full
-
blooded
young
men
,
and
had
plenty
of
stomach
for
fighting
;
but
the
government
did
not
dare
to
use
them
,
and
contented
itself
with
getting
full
powers
voted
to
it
by
the
parliament
for
suppressing
any
revolt
,
and
bringing
up
more
and
more
soldiers
to
london
.
thus
passed
the
week
after
the
great
meeting
;
almost
as
large
a
one
was
held
on
the
sunday
,
which
went
off
peaceably
on
the
whole
,
as
no
opposition
to
it
was
offered
,
and
again
the
people
cried
'
victory
.
'
but
on
the
monday
the
people
woke
up
to
find
that
they
were
hungry
.
during
the
last
few
days
there
had
been
groups
of
men
parading
the
streets
asking
(
or
,
if
you
please
,
demanding
)
money
to
buy
food
;
and
what
for
goodwill
,
what
for
fear
,
the
richer
people
gave
them
a
good
deal
.
the
authorities
of
the
parishes
also
(
i
have
not
time
to
explain
that
phrase
at
present
)
gave
willy
-
nilly
what
provisions
they
could
to
wandering
people
;
and
the
government
,
by
means
of
its
feeble
national
workshops
,
also
fed
a
good
number
of
half
-
starved
folk
.
but
