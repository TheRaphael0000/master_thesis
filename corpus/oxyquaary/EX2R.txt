on
the
seventeenth
,
the
day
i
was
trysted
with
the
writer
,
i
had
much
rebellion
against
fate
.
the
thought
of
him
waiting
in
the
king
'
s
arms
,
and
of
what
he
would
think
,
and
what
he
would
say
when
next
we
met
,
tormented
and
oppressed
me
.
the
truth
was
unbelievable
,
so
much
i
had
to
grant
,
and
it
seemed
cruel
hard
i
should
be
posted
as
a
liar
and
a
coward
,
and
have
never
consciously
omitted
what
it
was
possible
that
i
should
do
.
i
repeated
this
form
of
words
with
a
kind
of
bitter
relish
,
and
re
-
examined
in
that
light
the
steps
of
my
behaviour
.
it
seemed
i
had
behaved
to
james
stewart
as
a
brother
might
;
all
the
past
was
a
picture
that
i
could
be
proud
of
,
and
there
was
only
the
present
to
consider
.
i
could
not
swim
the
sea
,
nor
yet
fly
in
the
air
,
but
there
was
always
andie
.
i
had
done
him
a
service
,
he
liked
me
;
i
had
a
lever
there
to
work
on
;
if
it
were
just
for
decency
,
i
must
try
once
more
with
andie
.
it
was
late
afternoon
;
there
was
no
sound
in
all
the
bass
but
the
lap
and
bubble
of
a
very
quiet
sea
;
and
my
four
companions
were
all
crept
apart
,
the
three
macgregors
higher
on
the
rock
,
and
andie
with
his
bible
to
a
sunny
place
among
the
ruins
;
there
i
found
him
in
deep
sleep
,
and
,
as
soon
as
he
was
awake
,
appealed
to
him
with
some
fervour
of
manner
and
a
good
show
of
argument
.
"
if
i
thoucht
it
was
to
do
guid
to
ye
,
shaws
!
"
said
he
,
staring
at
me
over
his
spectacles
.
"
it
is
to
save
another
,
"
said
i
,
"
and
to
redeem
my
word
.
what
would
be
more
good
than
that
?
do
ye
no
mind
the
scripture
,
andie
?
and
you
with
the
book
upon
your
lap
!
what
shall
it
profit
a
man
if
he
gain
the
whole
world
?
"
"
ay
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
'
s
grand
for
you
.
but
where
do
i
come
in
!
i
have
my
word
to
redeem
the
same
'
s
yoursel
'
.
and
what
are
ye
asking
me
to
do
,
but
just
to
sell
it
ye
for
siller
?
"
"
andie
!
have
i
named
the
name

"
cried
i
.
"
ou
,
the
name
'
s
naething
"
,
said
he
;
"
the
thing

comes
to

ye
the
way

it

clear
ye

have

certain
of

by
a
'
that
i
can
learn

it
is
far
frae

no

.
and
just
awa
'
wi
'
ye
like
a
bonny
lad
!
and
let
andie
read
his
chapter
.
"
i
remember
i
was
at
bottom
a
good
deal
gratified
with
this
result
;
and
the
next
humour
i
fell
into
was
one
(
i
had
near
said
)
of
gratitude
to
prestongrange
,
who
had
saved
me
,
in
this
violent
,
illegal
manner
,
out
of
the
midst
of
my
dangers
,
temptations
,
and
perplexities
.
but
this
was
both
too
flimsy
and
too
cowardly
to
last
me
long
,
and
the
remembrance
of
james
began
to
succeed
to
the
possession
of
my
spirits
.
the
21st
,
the
day
set
for
the
trial
,
i
passed
in
such
misery
of
mind
as
i
can
scarce
recall
to
have
endured
,
save
perhaps
upon
isle
earraid
only
.
much
of
the
time
i
lay
on
a
brae
-
side
betwixt
sleep
and
waking
,
my
body
motionless
,
my
mind
full
of
violent
thoughts
.
sometimes
i
slept
indeed
;
but
the
court
-
house
of
inverary
and
the
prisoner
glancing
on
all
sides
to
find
his
missing
witness
,
followed
me
in
slumber
;
and
i
would
wake
again
with
a
start
to
darkness
of
spirit
and
distress
of
body
.
i
thought
andie
seemed
to
observe
me
,
but
i
paid
him
little
heed
.
verily
,
my
bread
was
bitter
to
me
,
and
my
days
a
burthen
.
early
the
next
morning
(
friday
,
22nd
)
a
boat
came
with
provisions
,
and
andie
placed
a
packet
in
my
hand
.
the
cover
was
without
address
but
sealed
with
a
government
seal
.
it
enclosed
two
notes
.
"
mr
.
balfour
can
now
see
for
himself
it
is
too
late
to
meddle
.
his
conduct
will
be
observed
and
his
discretion
rewarded
.
"
so
ran
the
first
,
which
seemed
to
be
laboriously
writ
with
the
left
hand
.
there
was
certainly
nothing
in
these
expressions
to
compromise
the
writer
,
even
if
that
person
could
be
found
;
the
seal
,
which
formidably
served
instead
of
signature
,
was
affixed
to
a
separate
sheet
on
which
there
was
no
scratch
of
writing
;
and
i
had
to
confess
that
(
so
far
)
my
adversaries
knew
what
they
were
doing
,
and
to
digest
as
well
as
i
was
able
the
threat
that
peeped
under
the
promise
.
but
the
second
enclosure
was
by
far
the
more
surprising
.
it
was
in
a
lady
'
s
hand
of
writ
.
"
maister
dauvit
balfour
is
informed
a
friend
was
speiring
for
him
and
her
eyes
were
of
the
grey
,
"
it
ran
,
and
seemed
so
extraordinary
a
piece
to
come
to
my
hands
at
such
a
moment
and
under
cover
of
a
government
seal
,
that
i
stood
stupid
.
catriona
'
s
grey
eyes
shone
in
my
remembrance
.
i
thought
,
with
a
bound
of
pleasure
,
she
must
be
the
friend
.
but
who
should
the
writer
be
,
to
have
her
billet
thus
enclosed
with
prestongrange
'
s
?
and
of
all
wonders
,
why
was
it
thought
needful
to
give
me
this
pleasing
but
most
inconsequent
intelligence
upon
the
bass
?
for
the
writer
,
i
could
hit
upon
none
possible
except
miss
grant
.
her
family
,
i
remembered
,
had
remarked
on
catriona
'
s
eyes
and
even
named
her
for
their
colour
;
and
she
herself
had
been
much
in
the
habit
to
address
me
with
a
broad
pronunciation
,
by
way
of
a
sniff
,
i
supposed
,
at
my
rusticity
.
no
doubt
,
besides
,
but
she
lived
in
the
same
house
as
this
letter
came
from
.
so
there
remained
but
one
step
to
be
accounted
for
;
and
that
was
how
prestongrange
should
have
permitted
her
at
all
in
an
affair
so
secret
,
or
let
her
daft
-
like
billet
go
in
the
same
cover
with
his
own
.
but
even
here
i
had
a
glimmering
.
for
,
first
of
all
,
there
was
something
rather
alarming
about
the
young
lady
,
and
papa
might
be
more
under
her
domination
than
i
knew
.
and
,
second
,
there
was
the
man
'
s
continual
policy
to
be
remembered
,
how
his
conduct
had
been
continually
mingled
with
caresses
,
and
he
had
scarce
ever
,
in
the
midst
of
so
much
contention
,
laid
aside
a
mask
of
friendship
.
he
must
conceive
that
my
imprisonment
had
incensed
me
.
perhaps
this
little
jesting
,
friendly
message
was
intended
to
disarm
my
rancour
?
i
will
be
honest
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
i
think
it
did
.
i
felt
a
sudden
warmth
towards
that
beautiful
miss
grant
,
that
she
should
stoop
to
so
much
interest
in
my
affairs
.
the
summoning
up
of
catriona
moved
me
of
itself
to
milder
and
more
cowardly
counsels
.
if
the
advocate
knew
of
her
and
our
acquaintance
.
.
.
.
.
.
if
i
should
please
him
by
some
of
that
"
discretion
"
at
which
his
letter
pointed
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
what
might
not
this
lead
!
in
vain
is
the
net
prepared
in
the
sight
of
any
fowl
,
the
scripture
says
.
well
,
fowls
must
be
wiser
than
folk
!
for
i
thought
i
perceived
the
policy
,
and
yet
fell
in
with
it
.
i
was
in
this
frame
,
my
heart
beating
,
the
grey
eyes
plain
before
me
like
two
stars
,
when
andie
broke
in
upon
my
musing
.
"
i
see
ye
has
gotten
guid
news
,
"
said
he
.
i
found
him
looking
curiously
in
my
face
;
with
that
there
came
before
me
like
a
vision
of
james
stewart
and
the
court
of
inverary
;
and
my
mind
turned
at
once
like
a
door
upon
its
hinges
.
trials
,
i
reflected
,
sometimes
draw
out
longer
than
is
looked
for
.
even
if
i
came
to
inverary
just
too
late
,
something
might
yet
be
attempted
in
the
interests
of
james
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
in
those
of
my
own
character
,
the
best
would
be
accomplished
.
in
a
moment
,
it
seemed
without
thought
,
i
had
a
plan
devised
.
"
andie
,
"
said
i
,
"

told
me

he
added
,
with
more
solemnity
,
and
offered
me
his
hand
upon
the
bargain
.
whereupon
,
with
scarce
more
words
,
we
stepped
suddenly
on
board
the
boat
,
cast
off
,
and
set
the
lug
.
the
gregara
were
then
busy
upon
breakfast
,
for
the
cookery
was
their
usual
part
;
but
,
one
of
them
stepping
to
the
battlements
,
our
flight
was
observed
before
we
were
twenty
fathoms
from
the
rock
;
and
the
three
of
them
ran
about
the
ruins
and
the
landing
-
shelf
,
for
all
the
world
like
ants
about
a
broken
nest
,
hailing
and
crying
on
us
to
return
.
we
were
still
in
both
the
lee
and
the
shadow
of
the
rock
,
which
last
lay
broad
upon
the
waters
,
but
presently
came
forth
in
almost
the
same
moment
into
the
wind
and
sunshine
;
the
sail
filled
,
the
boat
heeled
to
the
gunwale
,
and
we
swept
immediately
beyond
sound
of
the
men
'
s
voices
.
to
what
terrors
they
endured
upon
the
rock
,
where
they
were
now
deserted
without
the
countenance
of
any
civilised
person
or
so
much
as
the
protection
of
a
bible
,
no
limit
can
be
set
;
nor
had
they
any
brandy
left
to
be
their
consolation
,
for
even
in
the
haste
and
secrecy
of
our
departure
andie
had
managed
to
remove
it
.
it
was
our
first
care
to
set
anster
ashore
in
a
cove
by
the
glenteithy
rocks
,
so
that
the
deliverance
of
our
maroons
might
be
duly
seen
to
the
next
day
.
thence
we
kept
away
up
firth
.
the
breeze
,
which
was
then
so
spirited
,
swiftly
declined
,
but
never
wholly
failed
us
.
all
day
we
kept
moving
,
though
often
not
much
more
;
and
it
was
after
dark
ere
we
were
up
with
the
queensferry
.
to
keep
the
letter
of
andie
'
s
engagement
(
or
what
was
left
of
it
)
i
must
remain
on
board
,
but
i
thought
no
harm
to
communicate
with
the
shore
in
writing
.
on
prestongrange
'
s
cover
,
where
the
government
seal
must
have
a
good
deal
surprised
my
correspondent
,
i
writ
,
by
the
boat
'
s
lantern
,
a
few
necessary
words
,
aboard
and
andie
carried
them
to
rankeillor
.
in
about
an
hour
he
came
again
,
with
a
purse
of
money
and
the
assurance
that
a
good
horse
should
be
standing
saddled
for
me
by
two
to
-
morrow
at
clackmannan
pool
.
this
done
,
and
the
boat
riding
by
her
stone
anchor
,
we
lay
down
to
sleep
under
the
sail
.
we
were
in
the
pool
the
next
day
long
ere
two
;
and
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
sit
and
wait
.
i
felt
little
alacrity
upon
my
errand
.
i
would
have
been
glad
of
any
passable
excuse
to
lay
it
down
;
but
none
being
to
be
found
,
my
uneasiness
was
no
less
great
than
if
i
had
been
running
to
some
desired
pleasure
.
by
shortly
after
one
the
horse
was
at
the
waterside
,
and
i
could
see
a
man
walking
it
to
and
fro
till
i
should
land
,
which
vastly
swelled
my
impatience
.
andie
ran
the
moment
of
my
liberation
very
fine
,
showing
himself
a
man
of
his
bare
word
,
but
scarce
serving
his
employers
with
a
heaped
measure
;
and
by
about
fifty
seconds
after
two
i
was
in
the
saddle
and
on
the
full
stretch
for
stirling
.
in
a
little
more
than
an
hour
i
had
passed
that
town
,
and
was
already
mounting
alan
water
side
,
when
the
weather
broke
in
a
small
tempest
.
the
rain
blinded
me
,
the
wind
had
nearly
beat
me
from
the
saddle
,
and
the
first
darkness
of
the
night
surprised
me
in
a
wilderness
still
some
way
east
of
balwhidder
,
not
very
sure
of
my
direction
and
mounted
on
a
horse
that
began
already
to
be
weary
.
in
the
press
of
my
hurry
,
and
to
be
spared
the
delay
and
annoyance
of
a
guide
,
i
had
followed
(
so
far
as
it
was
possible
for
any
horseman
)
the
line
of
my
journey
with
alan
.
this
i
did
with
open
eyes
,
foreseeing
a
great
risk
in
it
,
which
the
tempest
had
now
brought
to
a
reality
.
the
last
that
i
knew
of
where
i
was
,
i
think
it
must
have
been
about
uam
var
;
the
hour
perhaps
six
at
night
.
i
must
still
think
it
great
good
fortune
that
i
got
about
eleven
to
my
destination
,
the
house
of
duncan
dhu
.
where
i
had
wandered
in
the
interval
perhaps
the
horse
could
tell
.
i
know
we
were
twice
down
,
and
once
over
the
saddle
and
for
a
moment
carried
away
in
a
roaring
burn
.
steed
and
rider
were
bemired
up
to
the
eyes
.
from
duncan
i
had
news
of
the
trial
.
it
was
followed
in
all
these
highland
regions
with
religious
interest
;
news
of
it
spread
from
inverary
as
swift
as
men
could
travel
;
and
i
was
rejoiced
to
learn
that
,
up
to
a
late
hour
that
saturday
it
was
not
yet
concluded
;
and
all
men
began
to
suppose
it
must
spread
over
the
monday
.
under
the
spur
of
this
intelligence
i
would
not
sit
to
eat
;
but
,
duncan
having
agreed
to
be
my
guide
,
took
the
road
again
on
foot
,
with
the
piece
in
my
hand
and
munching
as
i
went
.
duncan
brought
with
him
a
flask
of
usquebaugh
and
a
hand
-
lantern
;
which
last
enlightened
us
just
so
long
as
we
could
find
houses
where
to
rekindle
it
,
for
the
thing
leaked
outrageously
and
blew
out
with
every
gust
.
the
more
part
of
the
night
we
walked
blindfold
among
sheets
of
rain
,
and
day
found
us
aimless
on
the
mountains
.
hard
by
we
struck
a
hut
on
a
burn
-
side
,
where
we
got
bite
and
a
direction
;
and
,
a
little
before
the
end
of
the
sermon
,
came
to
the
kirk
doors
of
inverary
.
the
rain
had
somewhat
washed
the
upper
parts
of
me
,
but
i
was
still
bogged
as
high
as
to
the
knees
;
i
streamed
water
;
i
was
so
weary
i
could
hardly
limp
,
and
my
face
was
like
a
ghost
'
s
.
i
stood
certainly
more
in
need
of
a
change
of
raiment
and
a
bed
to
lie
on
,
than
of
all
the
benefits
in
christianity
.
for
all
which
(
being
persuaded
the
chief
point
for
me
was
to
make
myself
immediately
public
)
i
set
the
door
of
the
church
with
the
dirty
duncan
at
my
tails
,
and
finding
a
vacant
place
sat
down
.
"
thirteently
,
my
brethren
,
and
in
parenthesis
,
the
law
itself
must
be
regarded
as
a
means
of
grace
,
"
the
minister
was
saying
,
in
the
voice
of
one
delighting
to
pursue
an
argument
.
the
sermon
was
in
english
on
account
of
the
assize
.
the
judges
were
present
with
their
armed
attendants
,
the
halberts
glittered
in
a
corner
by
the
door
,
and
the
seats
were
thronged
beyond
custom
with
the
array
of
lawyers
.
the
text
was
in
romans
5th
and
13th
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
minister
a
skilled
hand
;
and
the
whole
of
that
able
churchful
.
.
.
.
.
.
from
argyle
,
and
my
lords
elchies
and
kilkerran
,
down
to
the
halbertmen
that
came
in
their
attendance
.
.
.
.
.
.
was
sunk
with
gathered
brows
in
a
profound
critical
attention
.
the
minister
himself
and
a
sprinkling
of
those
about
the
door
observed
our
entrance
at
the
moment
and
immediately
forgot
the
same
;
the
rest
either
did
not
hear
or
would
not
hear
or
would
not
be
heard
;
and
i
sat
amongst
my
friends
and
enemies
unremarked
.
the
first
that
i
singled
out
was
prestongrange
.
he
sat
well
forward
,
like
an
eager
horseman
in
the
saddle
,
his
lips
moving
with
relish
,
his
eyes
glued
on
the
minister
;
the
doctrine
was
clearly
to
his
mind
.
charles
stewart
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
half
asleep
,
and
looked
harassed
and
pale
.
as
for
simon
fraser
,
he
appeared
like
a
blot
,
and
almost
a
scandal
,
in
the
midst
of
that
attentive
congregation
,
digging
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
shifting
his
legs
,
clearing
his
throat
,
and
rolling
up
his
bald
eyebrows
and
shooting
out
his
eyes
to
right
and
left
,
now
with
a
yawn
,
now
with
a
secret
smile
.
at
times
,
too
,
he
would
take
the
bible
in
front
of
him
,
run
it
through
,
seem
to
read
a
bit
,
run
it
through
again
,
and
stop
and
yawn
prodigiously
:
the
whole
as
if
for
exercise
.
in
the
course
of
this
restlessness
his
eye
alighted
on
myself
.
he
sat
a
second
stupefied
,
then
tore
a
half
-
leaf
out
of
the
bible
,
scrawled
upon
it
with
a
pencil
,
and
passed
it
with
a
whispered
word
to
his
next
neighbour
.
the
note
came
to
prestongrange
,
who
gave
me
but
the
one
look
;
thence
it
voyaged
to
the
hands
of
mr
erskine
;
thence
again
to
argyle
,
where
he
sat
between
the
other
two
lords
of
session
,
and
his
grace
turned
and
fixed
me
with
an
arrogant
eye
.
the
last
of
those
interested
in
my
presence
was
charlie
stewart
,
and
he
too
began
to
pencil
and
hand
about
dispatches
,
none
of
which
i
was
able
to
trace
to
their
destination
in
the
crowd
.
but
the
passage
of
these
notes
had
aroused
notice
;
all
who
were
in
the
secret
(
or
supposed
themselves
to
be
so
)
were
whispering
information
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
rest
questions
;
and
the
minister
himself
seemed
quite
discountenanced
by
the
flutter
in
the
church
and
sudden
stir
and
whispering
.
his
voice
changed
,
he
plainly
faltered
,
nor
did
he
again
recover
the
easy
conviction
and
full
tones
of
his
delivery
.
it
would
be
a
puzzle
to
him
till
his
dying
day
,
why
a
sermon
that
had
gone
with
triumph
through
four
parts
,
should
this
miscarry
in
the
fifth
.
as
for
me
,
i
continued
to
sit
there
,
very
wet
and
weary
,
and
a
good
deal
anxious
as
to
what
should
happen
next
,
but
greatly
exulting
in
my
success
.
the
last
word
of
the
blessing
was
scarce
out
of
the
minister
'
s
mouth
before
stewart
had
me
by
the
arm
.
we
were
the
first
to
be
forth
of
the
church
,
and
he
made
such
extraordinary
expedition
that
we
were
safe
within
the
four
walls
of
a
house
before
the
street
had
begun
to
be
thronged
with
the
home
-
going
congregation
.
"
am
i
yet
in
time
?
"
i
asked
.
"
ay
and
no
,
"
said
he
.
"
the
case
is
over
;
the
jury
is
enclosed
,
and
will
so
kind
as
let
us
ken
their
view
of
it
to
-
morrow
in
the
morning
,
the
same
as
i
could
have
told
it
my
own
self
three
days
ago
before
the
play
began
.
the
thing
has
been

he
was
leaping
with
excitement
,
emptied
out
his
mails
upon
the
floor
that
i
might
have
a
change
of
clothes
,

incommoded
me
with
his
assistance

i
changed
.
what
remained
to
be
done
,

how
i
was
to
do
it

what
he
never
told

i
believe
,
so
much
as

of
.
"
we

"
that
was
still
his
overcome
.
and
it
was
forced
home
upon
my
mind
how
this
,
that
had
the
externals
of
a
sober
process
of
law
,
was
in
its
essence
a
clan
battle
between
savage
clans
.
i
thought
my
friend
the
writer
none
of
the
least
savage
.
who
that
had
only
seen
him
at
a
counsel
'
s
back
before
the
lord
ordinary
or
following
a
golf
ball
and
laying
down
his
clubs
on
bruntsfield
links
,
could
have
recognised
for
the
same
person
this
voluble
and
violent
clansman
?
james
stewart
'
s
counsel
were
four
in
number
.
.
.
.
.
.
sheriffs
brown
of
colstoun
and
miller
,
mr
robert
macintosh
,
and
mr
stewart
younger
of
stewart
hall
.
these
were
covenanted
to
dine
with
the
writer
after
sermon
,
and
i
was
very
obligingly
included
of
the
party
.
no
sooner
the
cloth
lifted
,
and
the
first
bowl
very
artfully
compounded
by
sheriff
miller
,
than
we
fell
to
the
subject
in
hand
.
i
made
a
short
narration
of
my
seizure
and
captivity
,
and
was
then
examined
and
re
-
examined
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
murder
.
it
will
be
remembered
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
had
my
say
out
,
or
the
matter
at
all
handled
,
among
lawyers
;
and
the
consequence
was
very
dispiriting
to
the
others
and
(
i
must
own
)
disappointing
to
myself
.
"
to
sum
up
,
"
said
colstoun
,
"
you
prove
that
alan
was
on
the
spot
;
you
have
heard
him
proffer
menaces
against
glenure
;
and
though
you
assure
us
he
was
not
the
man
who
fired
,
you
leave
a
strong
impression
that
he
was
in
league
with
him
,
and
consenting
,
perhaps
immediately
assisting
,
in
the
act
.
you
show
him
besides
,
at
the
risk
of
his
own
liberty
,
actively
furthering
the
criminal
'
s
escape
.
and
the
rest
of
your
testimony
(
so
far
as
the
least
material
)
depends
on
the
bare
word
of
alan
or
of
james
,
the
two
accused
.
in
short
,
you
do
not
at
all
break
,
but
only
lengthen
by
one
personage
,
the
chain
that
binds
our
client
to
the
murderer
;
and
i
need
scarcely
say
that
the
introduction
of
a
third
accomplice
rather
aggravates
that
appearance
of
a
conspiracy
which
has
been
our
stumbling
block
from
the
beginning
.
"
"
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
,
"
said
sheriff
miller
.
"
i
think
we
may
all
be
very
much
obliged
to
prestongrange

taking
a
most
uncomfortable
witness
out
of
our
way
.
and
chiefly
,
i
think
,
mr
balfour
himself
might
be
obliged
.
for
you
talk
of
a
third
accomplice
,

mr
balfour
(
in
my
view
)

very
much
the
appearance
of
a
fourth

stewart

a

up

said
stewart
hall
.
"
i
am
much
deceived
or
we
should
find
so
many
impediments
thrown
in
our
path
,
as
that
james
should
have
been
hanged
before
we
had
found
a
court
to
hear
us
.
this
is
a
great
scandal
,
but
i
suppose
we
have
none
of
us
forgot
a
greater
still
,
i
mean
the
matter
of
the
lady
grange
.
the
woman
was
still
in
durance
;
my
friend
mr
hope
of
rankeillor
did
what
was
humanly
possible
;
and
how
did
he
speed
?
he
never
got
a
warrant
!
well
,
it
will
be
the
same
now
;
the
same
weapons
will
be
used
.
this
is
a
scene
,
gentleman
,
of
clan
animosity
.
the
hatred
of
the
name
which
i
have
the
honour
to
bear
,
rages
in
high
quarters
.
there
is
nothing
here
to
be
viewed
but
naked
campbell
spite
and
scurvy
campbell
intrigue
.
"
you
may
be
sure
this
was
to
touch
a
welcome
topic
,
and
i
sat
for
some
time
in
the
midst
of
my
learned
counsel
,
almost
deaved
with
their
talk
but
extremely
little
the
wiser
for
its
purport
.
the
writer
was
led
into
some
hot
expressions
;
colstoun
must
take
him
up
and
set
him
right
;
the
rest
joined
in
on
different
sides
,
but
all
pretty
noisy
;
the
duke
of
argyle
was
beaten
like
a
blanket
;
king
george
came
in
for
a
few
digs
in
the
by
-
going
and
a
great
deal
of
rather
elaborate
defence
;
and
there
was
only
one
person
that
seemed
to
be
forgotten
,
and
that
was
james
of
the
glens
.
through
all
this
mr
miller
sat
quiet
.
he
was
a
slip
of
an
oldish
gentleman
,
ruddy
and
twinkling
;
he
spoke
in
a
smooth
rich
voice
,
with
an
infinite
effect
of
pawkiness
,
dealing
out
each
word
the
way
an
actor
does
,
to
give
the
most
expression
possible
;
and
even
now
,
when
he
was
silent
,
and
sat
there
with
his
wig
laid
aside
,
his
glass
in
both
hands
,
his
mouth
funnily
pursed
,
and
his
chin
out
,
he
seemed
the
mere
picture
of
a
merry
slyness
.
it
was
plain
he
had
a
word
to
say
,
and
waited
for
the
fit
occasion
.
it
came
presently
.
colstoun
had
wound
up
one
of
his
speeches
with
some
expression
of
their
duty
to
their
client
.
his
brother
sheriff
was
pleased
,
i
suppose
,
with
the
transition
.
he
took
the
table
in
his
confidence
with
a
gesture
and
a
look
.
"
that
suggests
to
me
a
consideration
which
seems
overlooked
,
"
said
he
.
"
the
interest
of
our
client
goes
certainly
before
all
,
but
the
world
does
not
come
to
an
end
with
james
stewart
.
"
whereat
he
cocked
his
eye
.
"
i
might
condescend
,
exempli
gratia
,
upon
a
mr
george
brown
,
a
mr
thomas
miller
,
and
a
mr
david
balfour
.
mr
david
balfour
has
a
very
good
ground
of
complaint
,
and
i
think
,
gentlemen
.
.
.
.
.
.
if
his
story
was
properly
redd
out
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
think
there
would
be
a
number
of
wigs
on
the
green
.
"
the
whole
table
turned
to
him
with
a
common
movement
.
"
properly
handled
and
carefully
redd
out
,
his
is
a
story
that
could
scarcely
fail
to
have
some
consequence
,
"
he
continued
.
"
the
whole
administration
of
justice
,
from
its
highest
officer
downward
,
would
be
totally
discredited
;
and
it
looks
to
me
as
if
they
would
need
to
be
replaced
.
"
he
seemed
to
shine
with
cunning
as
he
said
it
.
"
and
i
need
not
point
out
to
ye
that
this
of
mr
balfour
'
s
would
be
a
remarkable
bonny
cause
to
appear
in
,
"
he
added
.
well
,
there
they
all
were
started
on
another
hare
;
mr
balfour
'
s
cause
,
and
what
kind
of
speeches
could
be
there
delivered
,
and
what
officials
could
be
thus
turned
out
,
and
who
would
succeed
to
their
positions
.
i
shall
give
but
the
two
specimens
.
it
was
proposed
to
approach
simon
fraser
,
whose
testimony
,
if
it
could
be
obtained
,
would
prove
certainly
fatal
to
argyle
and
to
prestongrange
.
miller
highly
approved
of
the
attempt
.
"
we
have
here
before
us
a
dreeping
roast
,

said
he
,
"

again
for

.
"
and
methought
all
licked
their
lips
.
the
other
was
already
near
the
end
.
stewart
the
writer
was
out
of
the
body
with
delight
,
smelling
vengeance
on
his
chief
enemy
,
the
duke

"
gentlemen

cried
he
,
charging
his
glass
,
"

the
gratified
miller
.
"

you
like

i
can
promise
you

their

"
cries
stewart
,
smiting
down
his
fist
.
it
will
be
thought
i
was
not
very
well
pleased
with
all
this
,
though
i
could
scarce
forbear
smiling
at
a
kind
of
innocency
in
these
old
intriguers
.
but
it
was
not
my
view
to
have
undergone
so
many
sorrows
for
the
advancement
of
sheriff
miller
or
to
make
a
revolution
in
the
parliament
house
:
and
i
interposed
accordingly
with
as
much
simplicity
of
manner
as
i
could
assume
.
"
i
have
to
thank
you

gentlemen
,
for
your
advice

said
i
.
"
and
now
i
would
like
,
by
your
leave
,
to
set
you
two
or
three
questions
.
there
is
one
thing
that
has
fallen
rather
on
one
aide
,
for
instance
:
will
this
cause
do
any
good
to
our
friend
james
of
the
glens
?
"
they
seemed
all
a
hair
set
back
,
and
gave
various
answers
,
but
concurring
practically
in
one
point
,
that
james
had
now
no
hope
but
in
the
king
'
s
mercy
.
"
to
proceed
,
then
,
"
said
i
,
"
will
it
do
any
good
to
scotland
?
we
have
a
saying
that
it
is
an
ill
bird
that
fouls
his
own
nest
.
i
remember
hearing
we
had
a
riot
in
edinburgh
when
i
was
an
infant
child
,
which
gave
occasion
to
the
late
queen
to
call
this
country
barbarous
;
and
i
always
understood
that
we
had
rather
lost
than
gained
by
that
.
then
came
the
year
'
forty
-
five
,
which
made
scotland
to
be
talked
of
everywhere
;
but
i
never
heard
it
said
we
had
anyway
gained
by
the
'
forty
-
five
.
and
now
we
come
to
this
cause
of
mr
balfour
'
s
,
as
you
call
it
.
sheriff
miller
tells
us
historical
writers
are
to
date
from
it
,
and
i
would
not
wonder
.
it
is
only
my
fear
they
would
date
from
it
as
a
period
of
calamity
and
public
reproach
.
"
the
nimble
-
witted
miller
had
already
smelt
where
i
was
travelling
to
,
and
made
haste
to
get
on
the
same
road
.
"
forcibly
put
,
mr
balfour
,
"
says
he
.
"
a
weighty
observe
,
sir
.
"
"
we
have
next
to
ask
ourselves
if
it
will
be
good
for
king
george
,
"
i
pursued
.
"
sheriff
miller
appears
pretty
easy
upon
this
;
but
i
doubt
you
will
scarce
be
able
to
pull
down
the
house
from
under
him
,
without
his
majesty
coming
by
a
knock
or
two
,
one
of
which
might
easily
prove
fatal
.
"
i
have
them
a
chance
to
answer
,
but
none
volunteered
.
"
of
those
for
whom
the
case
was
to
be
profitable
,
"
i
went
on
,
"
sheriff
miller
gave
us
the
names
of
several
,
among
the
which
he
was
good
enough
to
mention
mine
.
i
hope
he
will
pardon
me
if
i
think
otherwise
.
i
believe
i
hung
not
the
least
back
in
this
affair
while
there
was
life
to
be
saved
;
but
i
own
i
thought
myself
extremely
hazarded
,
and
i
own
i
think
it
would
be
a
pity
for
a
young
man
,
with
some
idea
of
coming
to
the
bar
,
to
ingrain
upon
himself
the
character
of
a
turbulent
,
factious
fellow
before
he
was
yet
twenty
.
as
for
james
,
it
seems
.
.
.
.
.
.
at
this
date
of
the
proceedings
,
with
the
sentence
as
good
as
pronounced
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
has
no
hope
but
in
the
king
'
s
mercy
.
may
not
his
majesty
,
then
,
be
more
pointedly
addressed
,
the
characters
of
these
high
officers
sheltered
from
the
public
,
and
myself
kept
out
of
a
position
which
i
think
spells
ruin
for
me
?
"
they
all
sat
and
gazed
into
their
glasses
,
and
i
could
see
they
found
my
attitude
on
the
affair
unpalatable
.
but
miller
was
ready
at
all
events
.
"
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
put
my
young
friend
'
s
notion
in
more
formal
shape
,
"
says
he
,
"
i
understand
him
to
propose
that
we
should
embody
the
fact
of
his
sequestration
,
and
perhaps
some
heads
of
the
testimony
he
was
prepared
to
offer
,
in
a
memorial
to
the
crown
.
this
plan
has
elements
of
success
.
it
is
as
likely
as
any
other
(
and
perhaps
likelier
)
to
help
our
client
.
perhaps
his
majesty
would
have
the
goodness
to
feel
a
certain
gratitude
to
all
concerned
in
such
a
memorial
,
which
might
be
construed
into
an
expression
of
a
very
delicate
loyalty
;
and
i
think
,
in
the
drafting
of
the
same
,
this
view
might
be
brought
forward
.
"
they
all
nodded
to
each
other
,
not
without
sighs
,
for
the
former
alternative
was
doubtless
more
after
their
inclination
.
"
paper
,
then
,
mr
stewart
,
if
you
please
,
"
pursued
miller
;
"
and
i
think
it
might
very
fittingly
be
signed
by
the
five
of
us
here
present
,
as
procurators
for
the
condemned
man
.
"
'
"
it
can
do
none
of
us
any
harm
,
at
least
,
"
says
colstoun
,
heaving
another
sigh
,
for
he
had
seen
himself
lord
advocate
the
last
ten
minutes
.
thereupon
they
set
themselves
,
not
very
enthusiastically
,
to
draft
the
memorial
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
process
in
the
course
of
which
they
soon
caught
fire
;
and
i
had
no
more
ado
but
to
sit
looking
on
and
answer
an
occasional
question
.
the
paper
was
very
well
expressed
;
beginning
with
a
recitation
of
the
facts
about
myself
,
the
reward
offered
for
my
apprehension
,
my
surrender
,
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
upon
me
;
my
sequestration
;
and
my
arrival
at
inverary
in
time
to
be
too
late
;
going
on
to
explain
the
reasons
of
loyalty
and
public
interest
for
which
it
was
agreed
to
waive
any
right
of
action
;
and
winding
up
with
a
forcible
appeal
to
the
king
'
s
mercy
on
behalf
of
james
.
methought
i
was
a
good
deal
sacrificed
,
and
rather
represented
in
the
light
of
a
firebrand
of
a
fellow
whom
my
cloud
of
lawyers
had
restrained
with
difficulty
from
extremes
.
but
i
let
it
pass
,
and
made
but
the
one
suggestion
,
that
i
should
be
described
as
ready
to
deliver
my
own
evidence
and
adduce
that
of
others
before
any
commission
of
inquiry
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
the
one
demand
,
that
i
should
be
immediately
furnished
with
a
copy
.
colstoun
hummed
and
hawed
.
"
this
is
a
very
confidential
document
,
"
said
he
.
"
and
my
position
towards
prestongrange
is
highly
peculiar
,
"
i
replied
.
"
no
question
but
i
must
have
touched
his
heart
at
our
first
interview
,
so
that
he
has
since
stood
my
friend
consistently
.
but
for
him
,
gentlemen
,
i
must
now
be
lying
dead
or
awaiting
my
sentence
alongside
poor
james
.
for
which
reason
i
choose
to
communicate
to
him
the
fact
of
this
memorial
as
soon
as
it
is
copied
.
you
are
to
consider
also
that
this
step
will
make
for
my
protection
.
i
have
enemies
here
accustomed
to
drive
hard
;
his
grace
is
in
his
own
country
,
lovat
by
his
side
;
and
if
there
should
hang
any
ambiguity
over
our
proceedings
i
think
i
might
very
well
awake
in
gaol
.
"
not
finding
any
very
ready
answer
to
these
considerations
,
my
company
of
advisers
were
at
the
last
persuaded
to
consent
,
and
made
only
this
condition
that
i
was
to
lay
the
paper
before
prestongrange
with
the
express
compliments
of
all
concerned
.
the
advocate
was
at
the
castle
dining
with
his
grace
.
by
the
hand
of
one
of
colstoun
'
s
servants
i
sent
him
a
billet
asking
for
an
interview
,
and
received
a
summons
to
meet
him
at
once
in
a
private
house
of
the
town
.
here
i
found
him
alone
in
a
chamber
;
from
his
face
there
was
nothing
to
be
gleaned
;
yet
i
was
not
so
unobservant
but
what
i
spied
some
halberts
in
the
hall
,
and
not
so
stupid
but
what
i
could
gather
he
was
prepared
to
arrest
me
there
and
then
,
should
it
appear
advisable
.
"
so
,
mr
david
,
this
is
you
?
"
said
he
.
"
where
i
fear
i
am
not
overly
welcome
,
my
lord
,
"
said
i
.
"
and
i
would
like
before
i
go
further
to
express
my
sense
of
your
lordship
'
s
good
offices
,
even
should
they
now
cease
.
"
"
i
have
heard
of
your
gratitude
before
,
"
he
replied
drily
,
"
and
i
think
this
can
scarce
be
the
matter
you
called
me
from
my
wine
to
listen
to
.
i
would
remember
also
,
if
i
were
you
,
that
you
still
stand
on
a
very
boggy
foundation
.
"
"
not
now
,
my
lord
,
i
think
,
"
said
i
;
"
and
if
your
lordship
will
but
glance
an
eye
along
this
,
you
will
perhaps
think
as
i
do
.
"
he
read
it
sedulously
through
,
frowning
heavily
;
then
turned
back
to
one
part
and
another
which
he
seemed
to
weigh
and
compare
the
effect
of
.
his
face
a
little
lightened
.
"
this
is
not
so
bad
but
what
it
might
be
worse
,
"
said
he
;
"
though
i
am
still
likely
to
pay
dear
for
my
acquaintance
with
mr
david
balfour
.
"
"
rather
for
your
indulgence
to
that
unlucky
young
man
,
my
lord
,
"
said
i
.
he
still
skimmed
the
paper
,
and
all
the
while
his
spirits
seemed
to
mend
.
"
and
to
whom
am
i
indebted
for
this
?
"
he
asked
presently
.
"
other
counsels
must
have
been
discussed
,
i
think
.
who
was
it
proposed
this
private
method
?
was
it
miller
?
"
"
my
lord
,
it
was
myself
,
"
said
i
.
"
these
gentlemen
have
shown
me
no
such
consideration
,
as
that
i
should
deny
myself
any
credit
i
can
fairly
claim
,
or
spare
them
any
responsibility
they
should
properly
bear
.
and
the
mere
truth
is
,
that
they
were
all
in
favour
of
a
process
which
should
have
remarkable
consequences
in
the
parliament
house
,
and
prove
for
them
(
in
one
of
their
own
expressions
)
a
dripping
roast
.
before
i
intervened
,
i
think
they
were
on
the
point
of
sharing
out
the
different
law
appointments
.
our
friend
mr
simon
was
to
be
taken
in
upon
some
composition
.
"
prestongrange
smiled
.
"
these
are
our
friends
,
"
said
he
.
"
and
what
were
your
reasons
for
dissenting
,
mr
david
?
"
i
told
them
without
concealment
,
expressing
,
however
,
with
more
force
and
volume
those
which
regarded
prestongrange
himself
.
"
you
do
me
no
more
than
justice
,
"
said
he
.
"
i
have
fought
as
hard
in
your
interest

fought
against
mine

how
came
you
here
to

day

"
he
asked
.
"
as
the
case
drew
out
,
i
began
to
grow
uneasy
that
i
had
clipped
the
period
so
fine
,
and
i
was
even
expecting
you
to

morrow
.
but
to

day
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
never
dreamed

i
was
not
of
course

going
to
betray

"
i
suspect
there
is
some
very
weary
cattle
by
the
road

said
i
"

says
he
.
"
speaking

my
lord

i
return
your

i
gave
him
the

counterfeit

have
,

your
permission

"
i
thought
he
winced
a
little
,

he
said
nothing
to
the
point

"
to

he
resumed
,

so
far
from

may
reap
some
advantage

not
every
strange
young
man

is
presented
in

the
king

advocate

"
often
enough
already
(
in
our
brief
relations
)
this
gentleman
had
caused
my
head
to
spin
;
no
doubt
but
what
for
a
moment
he
did
so
again
now
.
here
was
the
old
fiction
still
maintained
of
my
particular
favour
with
his
daughters
,
one
of
whom
had
been
so
good
as
to
laugh
at
me
,
while
the
other
two
had
scarce
deigned
to
remark
the
fact
of
my
existence

now
i
was
to
ride
with
my
lord

i
was
to
be
brought
into
society
under
his
protection
!
that
he
should
have
so
much
good
-
nature
as
to
forgive
me
was
surprising
enough
;
that
he
could
wish
to
take
me
up
and
serve
me
seemed
impossible
;
and
i
began
to
seek
some
ulterior
meaning
.
one
was
plain
.
if
i
became
his
guest
,
repentance
was
excluded
;
i
could
never
think
better
of
my
present
design
and
bring
any
action
.
and
besides
,
would
not
my
presence
in
his
house
draw
out
the
whole
pungency
of
the
memorial
?
for
that
complaint
could
not
be
very
seriously
regarded
,
if
the
person
chiefly
injured
was
the
guest
of
the
official
most
incriminated
.
as
i
thought
upon
this
i
could
not
quite
refrain
from
smiling
.
"
this
is
in
the
nature
of
a
countercheck
to
the
memorial
?
"
said
i
.
"
you
are
cunning
,
mr
david
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
you
do
not
wholly
guess
wrong
the
fact
will
be
of
use
to
me
in
my
defence
.
perhaps
,
however
,
you
underrate
friendly
sentiments
,
which
are
perfectly
genuine
.
i
have
a
respect
for
you
,
david
,
mingled
with
awe
,
"
says
he
,
smiling
.
"
i
am
more
than
willing
,
i
am
earnestly
desirous
to
meet
your
wishes
,
"
said
i
.
"
it
is
my
design
to
be
called
to
the
bar
,
where
your
lordship
'
s
countenance
would
be
invaluable
;
and
i
am
besides
sincerely
grateful
to
yourself
and
family
for
different
marks
of
interest
and
of
indulgence
.
the
difficulty
is
here
.
there
is
one
point
in
which
we
pull
two
ways
.
you
are
trying
to
hang
james
stewart
,
i
am
trying
to
save
him
.
in
so
far
as
my
riding
with
you
would
better
your
lordship
'
s
defence
,
i
am
at
your
lordships
orders
;
but
in
so
far
as
it
would
help
to
hang
james
stewart
,
you
see
me
at
a
stick
.
"
i
thought
he
swore
to
himself
.
"
you
should
certainly
be
called
;
the
bar
is
the
true
scene
for
your
talents
,
"
says
he
,
bitterly
,
and
then
fell
a
while
silent
.
"
i
will
tell
you
,
"
he
presently
resumed
,
"
there
is
no
question
of
james
stewart
,
for
or
against
,
james
is
a
dead
man
;
his
life
is
given
and
taken
.
.
.
.
.
.
bought
(
if
you
like
it
better
)
and
sold
;
no
memorial
can
help
.
.
.
.
.
.
no
defalcation
of
a
faithful
mr
david
hurt
him
.
blow
high
,
blow
low
,
there
will
be
no
pardon
for
james
stewart
:
and
take
that
for
said
!
the
question
is
now
of
myself
:
am
i
to
stand
or
fall
?
and
i
do
not
deny
to
you
that
i
am
in
some
danger
.
but
will
mr
david
balfour
consider
why
?
it
is
not
because
i
pushed
the
case
unduly
against
james
;
for
that
,
i
am
sure
of
condonation
.
and
it
is
not
because
i
have
sequestered
mr
david
on
a
rock
,
though
it
will
pass
under
that
colour
;
but
because
i
did
not
take
the
ready
and
plain
path
,
to
which
i
was
pressed
repeatedly
,
and
send
mr
david
to
his
grave
or
to
the
gallows
.
hence
the
scandal
.
.
.
.
.
.
hence
this
damned
memorial
,
"
striking
the
paper
on
his
leg
.
"
my
tenderness
for
you
has
brought
me
in
this
difficulty
.
i
wish
to
know
if
your
tenderness
to
your
own
conscience
is
too
great
to
let
you
help
me
out
of
it
.
"
no
doubt
but
there
was
much
of
the
truth
in
what
he
said
;
if
james
was
past
helping
,
whom
was
it
more
natural
that
i
should
turn
to
help
than
just
the
man
before
me
,
who
had
helped
myself
so
often
,
and
was
even
now
setting
me
a
pattern
of
patience
?
i
was
besides
not
only
weary
,
but
beginning
to
be
ashamed
,
of
my
perpetual
attitude
of
suspicion
and
refusal
"
if
you
will
name
the
time
and
place
,
i
will
be
punctually
ready
to
attend
your
lordship
,
"
said
i
.
he
shook
hands
with
me
.
"
and
i
think
my
misses
have
some
news
for
you
,
"
says
he
,
dismissing
me
.
i
came
away
,
vastly
pleased
to
have
my
peace
made
,
yet
a
little
concerned
in
conscience
;
nor
could
i
help
wondering
,
as
i
went
back
,
whether
,
perhaps
,
i
had
not
been
a
scruple
too
good
-
natured
.
but
there
was
the
fact
,
that
this
was
a
man
that
might
have
been
my
father
,
an
able
man
,
a
great
dignitary
,
and
one
that
,
in
the
hour
of
my
need
,
had
reached
a
hand
to
my
assistance
.
i
was
in
the
better
humour
to
enjoy
the
remainder
of
that
evening
,
which
i
passed
with
the
advocates
,
in
excellent
company
no
doubt
,
but
perhaps
with
rather
more
than
a
sufficiency
of
punch
:
for
though
i
went
early
to
bed
i
have
no
clear
mind
of
how
i
got
there
.
on
the
morrow
,
from
the
justices
'
private
room
,
where
none
could
see
me
,
i
heard
the
verdict
given
in
and
judgment
rendered
upon
james
.
the
duke
'
s
words
i
am
quite
sure
i
have
correctly
;
and
since
that
famous
passage
has
been
made
a
subject
of
dispute
,
i
may
as
well
commemorate
my
version
.
having
referred
to
the
year
'
45
,
the
chief
of
the
campbells
,
sitting
as
justice
-
general
upon
the
bench
,
thus
addressed
the
unfortunate
stewart
before
him
:
"
if
you
had
been
successful
in
that
rebellion
,
you
might
have
been
giving
the
law
where
you
have
now
received
the
judgment
of
it
;
we
,
who
are
this
day
your
judges
,
might
have
been
tried
before
one
of
your
mock
courts
of
judicature
;
and
then
you
might
have
been
satiated
with
the
blood
of
any
name
or
clan
to
which
you
had
an
aversion
.
"
"
this
is
to
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
,
indeed
,
"
thought
i
.
and
that
was
the
general
impression
.
it
was
extraordinary
how
the
young
advocate
lads
took
hold
and
made
a
mock
of
this
speech
,
and
how
scarce
a
meal
passed
but
what
someone
would
get
in
the
words
:
"
and
then
you
might
have
been
satiated
.
"
many
songs
were
made
in
time
for
the
hour
'
s
diversion
,
and
are
near
all
forgot
.
i
remember
one
began
:
"
what
do
ye
want
the
bluid
of
,
bluid
of
?
is
it
a
name
,
or
is
it
a
clan
,
or
is
it
an
aefauld
hielandman
,
that
ye
want
the
bluid
of
,
bluid
of
?
"
another
went
to
my
old
favourite
air
,
the
house
of
airlie
,
and
began
thus
:
"
it
fell
on
a
day
when
argyle
was
on
the
bench
,
that
they
served
him
a
stewart
for
his
denner
.
"
and
one
of
the
verses
ran
:
"
then
up
and
spak
'
the
duke
,
and
flyted
on
his
cook
,
i
regard
it
as
a
sensible
aspersion
,
that
i
would
sup
ava
'
,
an
'
satiate
my
maw
,
with
the
bluid
of
ony
clan
of
my
aversion
.
"
james
was
as
fairly
murdered
as
though
the
duke
had
got
a
fowling
-
piece
and
stalked
him
.
so
much
of
course
i
knew
:
but
others
knew
not
so
much
,
and
were
more
affected
by
the
items
of
scandal
that
came
to
light
in
the
progress
of
the
cause
.
one
of
the
chief
was
certainly
this
sally
of
the
justice
'
s
.
it
was
run
hard
by
another
of
a
juryman
,
who
had
struck
into
the
midst
of
coulston
'
s
speech
for
the
defence
with
a
"
pray
,
sir
,
cut
it
short
,
we
are
quite
weary
,
"
which
seemed
the
very
excess
of
impudence
and
simplicity
.
but
some
of
my
new
lawyer
friends
were
still
more
staggered
with
an
innovation
that
had
disgraced
and
even
vitiated
the
proceedings
.
one
witness
was
never
called
.
his
name
,
indeed
,
was
printed
,
where
it
may
still
be
seen
on
the
fourth
page
of
the
list
:
"
james
drummond
,
alias
macgregor
,
alias
james
more
,
late
tenant
in
inveronachile
"
;
and
his
precognition
had
been
taken
,
as
the
manner
is
,
in
writing
.
he
had
remembered
or
invented
(
god
help
him
)
matter
which
was
lead
in
james
stewart
'
s
shoes
,
and
i
saw
was
like
to
prove
wings
to
his
own
.
this
testimony
it
was
highly
desirable
to
bring
to
the
notice
of
the
jury
,
without
exposing
the
man
himself
to
the
perils
of
cross
-
examination
;
and
the
way
it
was
brought
about
was
a
matter
of
surprise
to
all
.
for
the
paper
was
handed
round
(
like
a
curiosity
)
in
court
;
passed
through
the
jury
-
box
,
where
it
did
its
work
;
and
disappeared
again
(
as
though
by
accident
)
before
it
reached
the
counsel
for
the
prisoner
.
this
was
counted
a
most
insidious
device
;
and
that
the
name
of
james
more
should
be
mingled
up
with
it
filled
me
with
shame
for
catriona
and
concern
for
myself
.
the
following
day
,
prestongrange
and
i
,
with
a
considerable
company
,
set
out
for
glasgow
,
where
(
to
my
impatience
)
we
continued
to
linger
some
time
in
a
mixture
of
pleasure
and
affairs
.
i
lodged
with
my
lord
,
with
whom
i
was
encouraged
to
familiarity
;
had
my
place
at
entertainments
;
was
presented
to
the
chief
guests
;
and
altogether
made
more
of
than
i
thought
accorded
either
with
my
parts
or
station
;
so
that
,
on
strangers
being
present
,
i
would
often
blush
for
prestongrange
.
it
must
be
owned
the
view
i
had
taken
of
the
world
in
these
last
months
was
fit
to
cast
a
gloom
upon
my
character
.
i
had
met
many
men
,
some
of
them
leaders
in
israel
whether
by
their
birth
or
talents
;
and
who
among
them
all
had
shown
clean
hands
?
as
for
the
browns
and
millers
,
i
had
seen
their
self
-
seeking
,
i
could
never
again
respect
them
.
prestongrange
was
the
best
yet
;
he
had
saved
me
,
spared
me
rather
,
when
others
had
it
in
their
minds
to
murder
me
outright
;
but
the
blood
of
james
lay
at
his
door
;
and
i
thought
his
present
dissimulation
with
myself
a
thing
below
pardon
.
that
he
should
affect
to
find
pleasure
in
my
discourse
almost
surprised
me
out
of
my
patience
.
i
would
sit
and
watch
him
with
a
kind
of
a
slow
fire
of
anger
in
my
bowels
.
"
ah
,
friend
,
friend
,
"
i
would
think
to
myself
,
"
if
you
were
but
through
with
this
affair
of
the
memorial
,
would
you
not
kick
me
in
the
streets
?
"
here
i
did
him
,
as
events
have
proved
,
the
most
grave
injustice
;
and
i
think
he
was
at
once
far
more
sincere
,
and
a
far
more
artful
performer
,
than
i
supposed
.
but
i
had
some
warrant
for
my
incredulity
in
the
behaviour
of
that
court
of
young
advocates
that
hung
about
in
the
hope
of
patronage
.
the
sudden
favour
of
a
lad
not
previously
heard
of
troubled
them
at
first
out
of
measure
;
but
two
days
were
not
gone
by
before
i
found
myself
surrounded
with
flattery
and
attention
.
i
was
the
same
young
man
,
and
neither
better
nor
bonnier
,
that
they
had
rejected
a
month
before
;
and
now
there
was
no
civility
too
fine
for
me
!
the
same
,
do
i
say
?
it
was
not
so
;
and
the
by
-
name
by
which
i
went
behind
my
back
confirmed
it
.
seeing
me
so
firm
with
the
advocate
,
and
persuaded
that
i
was
to
fly
high
and
far
,
they
had
taken
a
word
from
the
golfing
green
,
and
called
me
the
tee
'
d
ball
.
i
was
told
i
was
now
"
one
of
themselves
"
;
i
was
to
taste
of
their
soft
lining
,
who
had
already
made
my
own
experience
of
the
roughness
of
the
outer
husk
;
and
one
,
to
whom
i
had
been
presented
in
hope
park
,
was
so
aspired
as
even
to
remind
me
of
that
meeting
.
i
told
him
i
had
not
the
pleasure
of
remembering
it
.
"
why
"
says
he
,
"
it
was
miss
grant
herself
presented
me
!
my
name
is
so
-
and
-
so
.
"
"
it
may
very
well
be
,
sir
,
"
said
i
;
"
but
i
have
kept
no
mind
of
it
.
"
at
which
he
desisted
;
and
in
the
midst
of
the
disgust
that
commonly
overflowed
my
spirits
i
had
a
glisk
of
pleasure
.
but
i
have
not
patience
to
dwell
upon
that
time
at
length
.
when
i
was
in
company
with
these
young
politics
i
was
borne
down
with
shame
for
myself
and
my
own
plain
ways
,
and
scorn
for
them
and
their
duplicity
.
of
the
two
evils
,
i
thought
prestongrange
to
be
the
least
;
and
while
i
was
always
as
stiff
as
buckram
to
the
young
bloods
,
i
made
rather
a
dissimulation
of
my
hard
feelings
towards
the
advocate
,
and
was
(
in
old
mr
campbell
'
s
word
)
"
soople
to
the
laird
.
"
himself
commented
on
the
difference
,
and
bid
me
be
more
of
my
age
,
and
make
friends
with
my
young
comrades
.
i
told
him
i
was
slow
of
making
friends
.
"
i
will
take
the
word
back
,
"
said
he
.
"
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
fair

fair

mr

these
are
the
same
young
men
with
whom
you
are
to
pass
your
days
and
get
through
life
:
your
backwardness
has
a
look
of
arrogance
;
and
unless
you
can
assume
a
little
more
lightness
of
manner
,
i
fear
you
will
meet
difficulties
in
the
path

"
said
i
.
on
the
morning
of
october
1st
i
was
awakened
by
the
clattering
in
of
an
express
;
and
getting
to
my
window
almost
before
he
had
dismounted
,
i
saw
the
messenger
had
ridden
hard
.
somewhile
after
i
was
called
to
prestongrange
,
where
he
was
sitting
in
his
bedgown
and
nightcap
,
with
his
letters
round
him
.
"
mr
.
david

"
add
he
,
"
i
have
a
piece
of
news
for
you
.
it
concerns
some
friends
of
yours
,
of
whom
i
sometimes
think
you
are
a
little
ashamed
,
for
you
have
never
referred
to
their
existence
.
"
i
suppose
i
blushed
.
"
see
you
understand
,
since
you
make
the
answering
signal
,
"
said
he
.
"
and
i
must
compliment
you
on
your
excellent
taste
in
beauty
.
but
do
you
know
,
mr
david
?
this
seems
to
me
a
very
enterprising
lass
.
she
crops
up
from
every
side
.
the
government
of
scotland
appears
unable
to
proceed
for
mistress
katrine
drummond
,
which
was
somewhat
the
case
(
no
great
while
back
)
with
a
certain
mr
david
balfour
.
should
not
these
make
a
good
match
?
her
first
intromission
in
politics
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
i
must
not
tell
you
that
story
,
the
authorities
have
decided
you
are
to
hear
it
otherwise
and
from
a
livelier
narrator
.
this
new
example
is
more
serious
,
however
;
and
i
am
afraid
i
must
alarm
you
with
the
intelligence
that
she
is
now
in
prison
.
"
i
cried
out
.
"
yes
,
"
said
he
,
"
the
little
lady
is
in
prison
.
but
i
would
not
have
you
to
despair
.
unless
you
(
with
your
friends
and
memorials
)
shall
procure
my
downfall

she
is
to
suffer
nothing
.
"
"
but
what
has
she
done
?
what
is
her
offence
?
"
i
cried
.
"
it
might
be
almost
construed
a
high
treason
,
"
he
returned
,
"
for
she
has
broke
the
king
'
s
castle
of
edinburgh
.
"
"
the
lady
is
much
my
friend

"
i
said
.
"
i
know
you
would
not
mock
me
if
the
thing
were
serious

"
"
and
yet
it
is
serious
in
a
sense

"
said
he
;
"
for
this
rogue
of
a
katrine
.
.
.
.
.
.
or
cateran
,
as
we
may
call
her
.
.
.
.
.
.
has
set
adrift
again
upon
the
world
that
very
doubtful
character
,
her
papa
.
"
here
was
one
of
my
previsions
justified
:
james
more
was
once
again
at
liberty
.
he
had
lent
his
men
to
keep
me
a
prisoner
;
he
had
volunteered
his
testimony
in
the
appin
case
,
and
the
same
(
no
matter
by
what
subterfuge
)
had
been
employed
to
influence
the
jury
.
now
came
his
reward
,
and
he
was
free
.
it
might
please
the
authorities
to
give
to
it
the
colour
of
an
escape
;
but
i
knew
better
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
knew
it
must
be
the
fulfilment
of
a
bargain
.
the
same
course
of
thought
relieved
me
of
the
least
alarm
for
catriona
.
she
might
be
thought
to
have
broke
prison
for
her
father
;
she
might
have
believed
so
herself
.
but
the
chief
hand
in
the
whole
business
was
that
of
prestongrange
;
and
i
was
sure
,
so
far
from
letting
her
come
to
punishment
,
he
would
not
suffer
her
to
be
even
tried
.
whereupon
thus
came
out
of
me
the
not
very
politic
ejaculation
:
"
ah
!
i
was
expecting
that
!
"
"
you
have
at
times
a
great
deal
of
discretion
,
too
!
"
says
prestongrange
.
"
and
what
is
my
lord
pleased
to
mean
by
that
?
"
i
asked
.
"
i
was
just
marvelling
"
,
he
replied
,
"
that
being
so
clever
as
to
draw
these
inferences
,
you
should
not
be
clever
enough
to
keep
them
to
yourself
.
but
i
think
you
would
like
to
hear
the
details
of
the
affair
.
i
have
received
two
versions
:
and
the
least
official
is
the
more
full
and
far
the
more
entertaining
,
being
from
the
lively
pen
of
my
eldest
daughter
.
'
here
is
all
the
town
bizzing
with
a
fine
piece
of
work
,
'
she
writes
,
'
and
what
would
make
the
thing
more
noted
(
if
it
were
only
known
)
the
malefactor
is
a
protegee
of
his
lordship
my
papa
.
i
am
sure
your
heart
is
too
much
in
your
duty
(
if
it
were
nothing
else
)
to
have
forgotten
grey
eyes
.
what
does
she
do
,
but
get
a
broad
hat
with
the
flaps
open
,
a
long
hairy
-
like
man
'
s
greatcoat
,
and
a
big
gravatt
;
kilt
her
coats
up
to
gude
kens
whaur
,
clap
two
pair
of
boot
-
hose
upon
her
legs
,
take
a
pair
of
clouted
brogues
in
her
hand
,
and
off
to
the
castle
!
here
she
gives
herself
out
to
be
a
soutar
in
the
employ
of
james
more
,
and
gets
admitted
to
his
cell
,
the
lieutenant
(
who
seems
to
have
been
full
of
pleasantry
)
making
sport
among
his
soldiers
of
the
soutar
'
s
greatcoat
.
presently
they
hear
disputation
and
the
sound
of
blows
inside
.
out
flies
the
cobbler
,
his
coat
flying
,
the
flaps
of
his
hat
beat
about
his
face
,
and
the
lieutenant
and
his
soldiers
mock
at
him
as
he
runs
off
.
they
laughed
no
so
hearty
the
next
time
they
had
occasion
to
visit
the
cell
and
found
nobody
but
a
tall
,
pretty
,
grey
-
eyed
lass
in
the
female
habit
!
as
for
the
cobbler
,
he
was
'
over
the
hills
ayout
dumblane
,
'
and
it
is
thought
that
poor
scotland
will
have
to
console
herself
without
him
.
i
drank
catriona
'
s
health
this
night
in
public
.
indeed
,
the
whole
town
admires
her
;
and
i
think
the
beaux
would
wear
bits
of
her
garters
in
their
button
-
holes
if
they
could
only
get
them
.
i
would
have
gone
to
visit
her
in
prison
too
,
only
i
remembered
in
time
i
was
papa
'
s
daughter
;
so
i
wrote
her
a
billet
instead
,
which
i
entrusted
to
the
faithful
doig
,
and
i
hope
you
will
admit
i
can
be
political
when
i
please
.
the
same
faithful
gomeral
is
to
despatch
this
letter
by
the
express
along
with
those
of

wiseacres

tell

a
predicament
