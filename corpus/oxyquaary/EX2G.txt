marguerite
neither
moved
nor
spoke
she
felt
two
pairs
of
eyes
fixed
upon
her
and
with
all
the
strength
of
will
at
her
command
she
forced
the
very
blood
in
her
veins
not
to
quit
her
cheeks
forced
her
eyelids
not
to
betray
by
a
single
quiver
the
icy
pang
of
a
deadly
premonition
which
at
sight
of
chauvelin
seemed
to
have
chilled
her
entire
soul
there
he
stood
before
her
dressed
in
his
usual
somber
garments
a
look
almost
of
humility
in
those
keen
grey
eyes
of
his
which
a
year
ago
on
the
cliffs
of
calais
had
peered
down
at
her
with
such
relentless
hate
strange
that
at
this
moment
she
should
have
felt
an
instinct
of
fear
what
cause
had
she
to
throw
more
than
a
pitiful
glance
at
the
man
who
had
tried
so
cruelly
to
wrong
her
and
who
had
so
signally
failed
having
bowed
very
low
and
very
respectfully
chauvelin
advanced
towards
her
with
all
the
airs
of
a
disgraced
courtier
craving
audience
from
his
queen
as
he
approached
she
instinctively
drew
back
would
you
prefer
not
to
speak
to
me
lady
blakeney
he
said
humbly
she
could
scarcely
believe
her
ears
or
trust
her
eyes
it
seemed
impossible
that
a
man
could
have
so
changed
in
a
few
months
he
even
looked
shorter
than
last
year
more
shrunken
within
himself
his
hair
which
he
wore
free
from
powder
was
perceptibly
tinged
with
grey
shall
i
withdraw
he
added
after
a
pause
seeing
that
marguerite
made
no
movement
to
return
his
salutation
it
would
be
best
perhaps
she
replied
coldly
you
and
i
monsieur
chauvelin
have
so
little
to
say
to
one
another
very
little
indeed
he
rejoined
quietly
the
triumphant
and
happy
have
ever
very
little
to
say
to
the
humiliated
and
the
defeated
but
i
had
hoped
that
lady
blakeney
in
the
midst
of
her
victory
would
have
spared
one
thought
of
pity
and
one
of
pardon
i
did
not
know
that
you
had
need
of
either
from
me
monsieur
pity
perhaps
not
but
forgiveness
certainly
you
have
that
if
you
so
desire
it
since
i
failed
you
might
try
to
forget
that
is
beyond
my
power
but
believe
me
i
have
ceased
to
think
of
the
infinite
wrong
which
you
tried
to
do
to
me
but
i
failed
he
insisted
and
i
meant
no
harm
to
you
to
those
i
care
for
monsieur
chauvelin
i
had
to
serve
my
country
as
best
i
could
i
meant
no
harm
to
your
brother
he
is
safe
in
england
now
and
the
scarlet
pimpernel
was
nothing
to
you
she
tried
to
read
his
face
tried
to
discover
in
those
inscrutable
eyes
of
his
some
hidden
meaning
to
his
words
instinct
had
warned
her
of
course
that
this
man
could
be
nothing
but
an
enemy
always
and
at
all
times
but
he
seemed
so
broken
so
abject
now
that
contempt
for
his
dejected
attitude
and
for
the
defeat
which
had
been
inflicted
on
him
chased
the
last
remnant
of
fear
from
her
heart
i
did
not
even
succeed
in
harming
that
enigmatical
personage
continued
chauvelin
with
the
same
self
-
abasement
sir
percy
blakeney
you
remember
threw
himself
across
my
plans
quite
innocently
of
course
i
failed
where
you
succeeded
luck
has
deserted
me
our
government
offered
me
a
humble
post
away
from
france
i
look
after
the
interests
of
french
subjects
settled
in
england
my
days
of
power
are
over
my
failure
is
complete
i
do
not
complain
for
i
failed
in
a
combat
of
wits
but
i
failed
i
failed
i
failed
i
am
almost
a
fugitive
and
i
am
quite
disgraced
that
is
my
present
history
lady
blakeney
he
concluded
taking
once
more
a
step
towards
her
and
you
will
understand
that
it
would
be
a
solace
if
you
extended
your
hand
to
me
just
once
more
and
let
me
feel
that
although
you
would
never
willingly
look
upon
my
face
again
you
have
enough
womanly
tenderness
in
you
to
force
your
heart
to
forgiveness
and
mayhap
to
pity
marguerite
hesitated
he
held
out
his
hand
and
her
warm
impulsive
nature
prompted
her
to
be
kind
but
instinct
would
not
be
gainsaid
a
curious
instinct
to
which
she
refused
to
respond
what
had
she
to
fear
from
this
miserable
and
cringing
little
worm
who
had
not
even
in
him
the
pride
of
defeat
what
harm
could
he
do
to
her
or
to
those
whom
she
loved
her
brother
was
in
england
her
husband
bah
not
the
enmity
of
the
entire
world
could
make
her
fear
for
him
nay
that
instinct
which
caused
her
to
draw
away
from
chauvelin
as
she
would
from
a
venomous
asp
was
certainly
not
fear
it
was
hate
she
hated
this
man
hated
him
for
all
that
she
had
suffered
because
of
him
for
that
terrible
night
on
the
cliffs
of
calais
the
peril
to
her
husband
who
had
become
so
infinitely
dear
the
humiliations
and
self
-
reproaches
which
he
had
endured
yes
it
was
hate
and
hate
was
of
all
emotions
the
one
she
most
despised
hate
does
one
hate
a
slimy
but
harmless
toad
or
a
stinging
fly
it
seemed
ridiculous
contemptible
and
pitiable
to
think
of
hate
in
connection
with
the
melancholy
figure
of
this
discomfited
intriguer
this
fallen
leader
of
revolutionary
france
he
was
holding
out
his
hand
to
her
if
she
placed
even
the
tips
of
her
fingers
upon
it
she
would
be
making
the
compact
of
mercy
and
forgiveness
which
he
was
asking
of
her
the
woman
desiree
candeille
roused
within
her
the
last
lingering
vestige
of
her
slumbering
wrath
false
theatrical
and
stagy
as
marguerite
had
originally
suspected
she
appeared
to
have
been
in
league
with
chauvelin
to
bring
about
this
undesirable
meeting
lady
blakeney
turned
from
one
to
another
trying
to
conceal
her
contempt
beneath
a
mask
of
passionless
indifference
candeille
was
standing
close
by
looking
obviously
distressed
and
not
a
little
puzzled
an
instant
'
s
reflection
was
sufficient
to
convince
marguerite
that
the
whilom
actress
of
the
varietes
theatre
was
obviously
ignorant
of
the
events
to
which
chauvelin
had
been
alluding
she
was
therefore
of
no
serious
consequence
a
mere
tool
mayhap
in
the
ex
-
ambassador
'
s
hands
at
the
present
moment
she
looked
like
a
silly
child
who
does
not
understand
the
conversation
of
the
grown
-
ups
marguerite
had
promised
her
help
and
protection
had
invited
her
to
her
house
and
offered
her
a
munificent
gift
in
aid
of
a
deserving
cause
she
was
too
proud
to
go
back
now
on
that
promise
to
rescind
the
contract
because
of
an
unexplainable
fear
with
regard
to
chauvelin
the
matter
stood
differently
she
had
made
him
no
direct
offer
of
hospitality
she
had
agreed
to
receive
in
her
house
the
official
chaperone
of
an
unprotected
girl
but
she
was
not
called
upon
to
show
cordiality
to
her
own
and
her
husband
'
s
most
deadly
enemy
she
was
ready
to
dismiss
him
out
of
her
life
with
a
cursory
word
of
pardon
and
a
half
-
expressed
promise
of
oblivion
on
that
understanding
and
that
only
she
was
ready
to
let
her
hand
rest
for
the
space
of
one
second
in
his
she
had
looked
upon
her
fallen
enemy
seen
his
discomfiture
and
his
humiliation
very
well
now
let
him
pass
out
of
her
life
all
the
more
easily
since
the
last
vision
of
him
would
be
one
of
such
utter
abjection
as
would
even
be
unworthy
of
hate
all
these
thoughts
feelings
and
struggles
passed
through
her
mind
with
great
rapidity
her
hesitation
had
lasted
less
than
five
seconds
chauvelin
still
wore
the
look
of
doubting
entreaty
with
which
he
had
first
begged
permission
to
take
her
hand
in
his
with
an
impulsive
toss
of
the
head
she
had
turned
straight
towards
him
ready
with
the
phrase
with
which
she
meant
to
dismiss
him
from
her
sight
now
and
forever
when
suddenly
a
well
-
known
laugh
broke
in
upon
her
ear
and
a
lazy
drawly
voice
said
pleasantly
la
i
vow
the
air
is
fit
to
poison
you
your
royal
highness
i
entreat
let
us
turn
our
backs
upon
these
gates
of
inferno
where
lost
souls
would
feel
more
at
home
than
doth
your
humble
servant
the
next
moment
his
royal
highness
the
prince
of
wales
had
entered
the
tent
closely
followed
by
sir
percy
blakeney
it
was
in
truth
a
strange
situation
this
chance
meeting
between
percy
blakeney
and
ex
-
ambassador
chauvelin
marguerite
looked
up
at
her
husband
she
saw
him
shrug
his
broad
shoulders
as
he
first
caught
sight
of
chauvelin
and
glance
down
in
his
usual
lazy
good
-
humoured
manner
at
the
shrunken
figure
of
the
silent
frenchman
the
words
she
meant
to
say
never
crossed
her
lips
she
was
waiting
to
hear
what
the
two
men
would
say
to
one
another
the
instinct
of
the
grande
dame
in
her
the
fashionable
lady
accustomed
to
the
exigencies
of
society
just
gave
her
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
make
the
requisite
low
curtsey
before
his
royal
highness
but
the
prince
forgetting
his
accustomed
gallantry
was
also
absorbed
in
the
little
scene
before
him
he
too
was
looking
from
the
sable
-
clad
figure
of
chauvelin
to
that
of
gorgeously
arrayed
sir
percy
he
too
like
marguerite
was
wondering
what
was
passing
behind
the
low
smooth
forehead
of
that
inimitable
dandy
what
behind
the
inscrutably
good
-
humoured
expression
of
those
sleepy
eyes
of
the
five
persons
thus
present
in
the
dark
and
stuffy
booth
certainly
sir
percy
blakeney
seemed
the
least
perturbed
he
had
paused
just
long
enough
to
allow
chauvelin
to
become
fully
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
supreme
irritation
and
annoyance
then
he
strolled
up
to
the
ex
-
ambassador
with
hand
outstretched
and
the
most
engaging
of
smiles
ha
he
said
with
his
usual
half
-
shy
half
-
pleasant
-
tempered
smile
my
engaging
friend
from
france
i
hope
sir
that
our
demmed
climate
doth
find
you
well
and
hearty
to
-
day
the
cheerful
voice
seemed
to
ease
the
tension
marguerite
sighed
a
sigh
of
relief
after
all
what
was
more
natural
than
that
percy
with
his
amazing
fund
of
pleasant
irresponsibility
should
thus
greet
the
man
who
had
once
vowed
to
bring
him
to
the
guillotine
chauvelin
himself
accustomed
by
now
to
the
audacious
coolness
of
his
enemy
was
scarcely
taken
by
surprise
he
bowed
low
to
his
highness
who
vastly
amused
at
blakeney
'
s
sally
was
inclined
to
be
gracious
to
everyone
even
though
the
personality
of
chauvelin
as
a
well
-
known
leader
of
the
regicide
government
was
inherently
distasteful
to
him
but
the
prince
saw
in
the
wizened
little
figure
before
him
an
obvious
butt
for
his
friend
blakeney
'
s
impertinent
shafts
and
although
historians
have
been
unable
to
assert
positively
whether
or
no
george
prince
of
wales
knew
aught
of
sir
percy
'
s
dual
life
yet
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
was
always
ready
to
enjoy
a
situation
which
brought
about
the
discomfiture
of
any
of
the
scarlet
pimpernel
'
s
avowed
enemies
i
too
have
not
met
m
chauvelin
for
many
a
long
month
said
his
royal
highness
with
an
obvious
show
of
irony
and
i
mistake
not
sir
you
left
my
father
'
s
court
somewhat
abruptly
last
year
nay
your
royal
highness
said
percy
gaily
my
friend
monsieur
er
chaubertin
and
i
had
serious
business
to
discuss
which
could
only
be
dealt
with
in
france
am
i
not
right
monsieur
quite
right
sir
percy
replied
chauvelin
curtly
we
had
to
discuss
abominable
soup
in
calais
had
we
not
continued
blakeney
in
the
same
tone
of
easy
banter
and
wine
that
i
vowed
was
vinegar
monsieur
er
chaubertin
no
no
i
beg
pardon
chauvelin
monsieur
chauvelin
and
i
quite
agreed
upon
that
point
the
only
matter
on
which
we
were
not
quite
at
one
was
the
question
of
snuff
snuff
laughed
his
royal
highness
who
seemed
vastly
amused
yes
your
royal
highness
snuff
monsieur
chauvelin
here
had
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
so
so
vitiated
a
taste
in
snuff
that
he
prefers
it
with
an
admixture
of
pepper
is
that
not
so
monsieur
er
chaubertin
chauvelin
sir
percy
remarked
the
ex
-
ambassador
drily
he
was
determined
not
to
lose
his
temper
and
looked
urbane
and
pleasant
whilst
his
impudent
enemy
was
enjoying
a
joke
at
his
expense
marguerite
the
while
had
not
taken
her
eyes
off
the
keen
shrewd
face
whilst
the
three
men
talked
she
seemed
suddenly
to
have
lost
her
sense
of
the
reality
of
things
the
present
situation
appeared
to
her
strangely
familiar
like
a
dream
which
she
had
dreamt
oft
times
before
suddenly
it
became
absolutely
clear
to
her
that
the
whole
scene
had
been
arranged
and
planned
the
booth
with
its
flaring
placard
demoiselle
candeille
soliciting
her
patronage
her
invitation
to
the
young
actress
chauvelin
'
s
sudden
appearance
all
all
had
been
concocted
and
arranged
not
here
not
in
england
at
all
but
out
there
in
paris
in
some
dark
gathering
of
blood
-
thirsty
ruffians
who
had
invented
a
final
trap
for
the
destruction
of
the
bold
adventurer
who
went
by
the
name
of
the
scarlet
pimpernel
and
she
also
was
only
a
puppet
enacting
a
part
which
had
been
written
for
her
she
had
acted
just
as
they
had
anticipated
had
spoken
the
very
words
they
had
meant
her
to
say
and
when
she
looked
at
percy
he
seemed
supremely
ignorant
of
it
all
unconscious
of
this
trap
of
the
existence
of
which
everyone
here
present
was
aware
save
indeed
himself
she
would
have
fought
against
this
weird
feeling
of
obsession
of
being
a
mechanical
toy
would
up
to
do
certain
things
but
this
she
could
not
do
her
will
appeared
paralysed
her
tongue
even
refused
her
service
as
in
a
dream
she
heard
his
royal
highness
ask
for
the
name
of
the
young
actress
who
was
soliciting
alms
for
the
poor
of
paris
that
also
had
been
prearranged
his
royal
highness
for
the
moment
was
also
a
puppet
made
to
dance
to
speak
and
to
act
as
chauvelin
and
his
colleagues
over
in
france
had
decided
that
he
should
quite
mechanically
marguerite
introduced
demoiselle
candeille
to
the
prince
'
s
gracious
notice
if
your
highness
will
permit
she
said
mademoiselle
candeille
will
give
us
some
of
her
charming
old
french
songs
at
my
rout
to
-
morrow
by
all
means
by
all
means
said
the
prince
i
used
to
know
some
in
my
childhood
days
charming
and
poetic
i
know
i
know
we
shall
be
delighted
to
hear
mademoiselle
sing
eh
blakeney
he
added
good
-
humouredly
and
for
your
rout
to
-
morrow
will
you
not
also
invite
m
chauvelin
nay
but
that
goes
without
saying
your
royal
highness
responded
sir
percy
with
hospitable
alacrity
and
a
most
approved
bow
directed
at
his
arch
-
enemy
we
shall
expect
m
chauvelin
he
and
i
have
not
met
for
so
long
and
he
shall
be
made
right
welcome
at
blakeney
manor
her
origin
was
of
the
humblest
for
her
mother
so
it
was
said
had
been
kitchen
-
maid
in
the
household
of
the
duc
de
marny
but
desiree
had
received
some
kind
of
education
and
though
she
began
life
as
a
dresser
in
one
of
the
minor
theatres
of
paris
she
became
ultimately
one
of
its
most
popular
stars
she
was
small
and
dark
dainty
in
her
manner
and
ways
and
with
a
graceful
little
figure
peculiarly
supple
and
sinuous
her
humble
origin
certainly
did
not
betray
itself
in
her
hands
and
feet
which
were
exquisite
in
shape
and
lilliputian
in
size
her
hair
was
soft
and
glossy
always
free
from
powder
and
cunningly
arranged
so
as
to
slightly
overshadow
the
upper
part
of
her
face
the
chin
was
small
and
round
the
mouth
extraordinarily
red
the
neck
slender
and
long
but
she
was
not
pretty
so
said
all
the
women
her
skin
was
rather
coarse
in
texture
and
darkish
in
colour
her
eyes
were
narrow
and
slightly
turned
upwards
at
the
corners
no
she
was
distinctly
not
pretty
yet
she
pleased
the
men
perhaps
because
she
was
so
artlessly
determined
to
please
them
the
women
said
that
demoiselle
candeille
never
left
a
man
alone
until
she
had
succeeded
in
captivating
his
fancy
if
only
for
five
minutes
an
internal
in
a
dance
the
time
to
cross
a
muddy
road
but
for
five
minutes
she
was
determined
to
hold
any
man
'
s
complete
attention
and
to
exact
his
admiration
and
she
nearly
always
succeeded
therefore
the
women
hated
her
the
men
were
amused
it
is
extremely
pleasant
to
have
one
'
s
admiration
compelled
one
'
s
attention
so
determinedly
sought
after
and
candeille
could
be
extremely
amusing
and
as
madelon
in
moliere
'
s
les
precieuses
was
quite
inimitable
this
however
was
in
the
olden
days
just
before
paris
went
quite
mad
before
the
reign
of
terror
had
set
in
and
ci
-
devant
louis
the
king
had
been
executed
candeille
had
taken
it
into
her
frolicsome
little
head
that
she
would
like
to
go
to
london
the
idea
was
of
course
in
the
nature
of
an
experiment
those
dull
english
people
over
the
water
knew
so
little
of
what
good
acting
really
meant
tragedy
well
passons
their
heavy
large
-
boned
actresses
might
manage
one
or
two
big
scenes
where
a
commanding
presence
and
a
powerful
voice
would
not
come
amiss
and
where
prominent
teeth
would
pass
unnoticed
in
the
agony
of
a
dramatic
climax
but
comedy
ah
ca
non
par
example
demoiselle
candeille
had
seen
several
english
gentlemen
and
ladies
in
those
same
olden
days
at
the
tuileries
but
she
really
could
not
imagine
any
of
them
enacting
the
piquant
scenes
of
moliere
or
beaumarchais
demoiselle
candeille
thought
of
every
english
-
born
individual
as
having
very
large
teeth
now
large
teeth
do
not
lend
themselves
to
well
-
spoken
comedy
scenes
to
smiles
or
to
double
entendre
her
own
teeth
were
exceptionally
small
and
white
and
very
sharp
like
those
of
a
kitten
yes
demoiselle
candeille
thought
it
would
be
extremely
interesting
to
go
to
london
and
to
show
to
a
nation
of
shopkeepers
how
daintily
one
can
be
amused
in
a
theatre
permission
to
depart
from
paris
was
easy
to
obtain
in
fact
the
fair
lady
had
never
really
found
it
difficult
to
obtain
anything
she
very
much
wanted
in
this
case
she
had
plenty
of
friends
in
high
places
marat
was
still
alive
and
a
great
lover
of
the
theatre
tallien
was
a
personal
admirer
of
hers
deputy
dupont
would
do
anything
she
asked
she
wanted
to
act
in
london
at
a
theatre
called
drury
lane
she
wanted
to
play
moliere
in
england
in
french
and
had
already
spoken
with
several
of
her
colleagues
who
were
ready
to
join
her
they
would
give
public
representations
in
aid
of
the
starving
population
of
france
there
were
plenty
of
socialistic
clubs
in
london
quite
jacobin
and
revolutionary
in
tendency
their
members
would
give
her
full
support
she
would
be
serving
her
country
and
her
countrymen
and
incidentally
see
something
of
the
world
and
amuse
herself
she
was
bored
in
paris
then
she
thought
of
marguerite
st
just
once
of
the
maison
moliere
who
had
captivated
an
english
milor
of
enormous
wealth
demoiselle
candeille
had
never
been
of
the
maison
moliere
she
had
been
the
leading
star
of
one
of
the
minor
yet
much
-
frequented
theatres
of
paris
but
she
felt
herself
quite
able
and
ready
to
captivate
some
other
unattached
milor
who
would
load
her
with
english
money
and
incidentally
bestow
an
english
name
upon
her
so
she
went
to
london
the
experiment
however
had
not
proved
an
unmitigated
success
at
first
she
and
her
company
did
obtain
a
few
engagements
at
one
or
two
of
the
minor
theatres
to
give
representations
of
some
of
the
french
classical
comedies
in
the
original
language
but
these
never
quite
became
the
fashion
the
feeling
against
france
and
all
her
doings
was
far
too
keen
in
that
very
set
which
demoiselle
candeille
had
desired
to
captivate
with
her
talents
to
allow
of
the
english
jeunesse
doree
to
flock
and
see
moliere
played
in
french
by
a
french
troupe
whilst
candeille
'
s
own
compatriots
resident
in
england
had
given
her
but
scant
support
one
section
of
these
the
aristocrats
and
emigres
looked
upon
the
actress
who
was
a
friend
of
all
the
jacobins
in
paris
as
nothing
better
than
canaille
they
sedulously
ignored
her
presence
in
this
country
and
snubbed
her
whenever
they
had
an
opportunity
the
other
section
chiefly
consisting
of
agents
and
spies
of
the
revolutionary
government
she
would
gladly
have
ignored
they
had
at
first
made
a
constant
demand
on
her
purse
her
talents
and
her
time
then
she
grew
tired
of
them
and
felt
more
and
more
chary
of
being
identified
with
a
set
which
was
in
such
ill
-
odour
with
that
very
same
jeunesse
doree
whom
candeille
had
desired
to
please
in
her
own
country
she
was
and
always
had
been
a
good
republican
marat
had
given
her
her
first
start
in
life
by
his
violent
praises
of
her
talent
in
his
widely
-
circulated
paper
she
had
been
associated
in
paris
with
the
whole
coterie
of
artists
and
actors
every
one
of
them
republican
to
a
man
but
in
london
although
one
might
be
snubbed
by
the
emigres
and
aristocrats
it
did
not
do
to
be
mixed
up
with
the
sans
-
culotte
journalists
and
pamphleteers
who
haunted
the
socialistic
clubs
of
the
english
capital
and
who
were
the
prime
organizers
of
all
those
seditious
gatherings
and
treasonable
unions
that
caused
mr
pitt
and
his
colleagues
so
much
trouble
and
anxiety
one
by
one
desiree
candeille
'
s
comrades
male
and
female
who
had
accompanied
her
to
england
returned
to
their
own
country
when
war
was
declared
some
of
them
were
actually
sent
back
under
the
provisions
of
the
aliens
bill
but
desiree
had
stayed
on
her
old
friends
in
paris
had
managed
to
advise
her
that
she
would
not
be
very
welcome
there
just
now
the
sans
-
culotte
journalists
of
england
the
agents
and
spies
of
the
revolutionary
government
had
taken
their
revenge
of
the
frequent
snubs
inflicted
upon
them
by
the
young
actress
and
in
those
days
the
fact
of
being
unwelcome
in
france
was
apt
to
have
a
more
lurid
and
more
dangerous
significant
candeille
did
not
dare
return
at
any
rate
not
for
the
present
she
trusted
to
her
own
powers
of
intrigue
and
her
well
-
known
fascinations
to
re
-
conquer
the
friendship
of
the
jacobin
clique
and
she
once
more
turned
her
attention
to
the
affiliated
socialistic
clubs
of
england
but
between
the
proverbial
two
stools
demoiselle
candeille
soon
came
to
the
ground
her
machinations
became
known
in
official
quarters
her
connection
with
all
the
seditious
clubs
of
london
was
soon
bruited
abroad
and
one
evening
desiree
found
herself
confronted
with
a
document
addressed
to
her
from
the
office
of
his
majesty
'
s
privy
seal
wherein
it
was
set
forth
that
pursuant
to
the
statute
33
george
iii
cap
5
she
desiree
candeille
a
french
subject
now
resident
in
england
was
required
to
leave
this
kingdom
by
order
of
his
majesty
within
seven
days
and
that
in
the
event
of
the
said
desiree
candeille
refusing
to
comply
with
this
order
she
would
be
liable
to
commitment
brought
to
trial
and
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
a
month
and
afterwards
to
removal
within
a
limited
time
under
pain
of
transportation
for
life
this
meant
that
demoiselle
candeille
had
exactly
seven
days
in
which
to
make
complete
her
reconciliation
with
her
former
friends
who
now
ruled
paris
and
france
with
a
relentless
and
perpetually
bloodstained
hand
no
wonder
that
during
the
night
which
followed
the
receipt
of
this
momentous
document
demoiselle
candeille
suffered
gravely
from
insomnia
she
dared
not

back
to

she
was
ordered
out
of
england
what
was
to
become
of
her
this
was
just
three
days
before
the
eventful
afternoon
of
the
richmond
gala
and
twenty
-
four
hours
after
ex
-
ambassador
chauvelin
had
landed
in
england
candeille
and
chauvelin
had
since
then
met
at
the
cercle
des
jacobins
francais
in
soho
street
and
now
fair
desiree
found
herself
in
lodgings
in
richmond
the
evening
of
the
day
following
the
gala
feeling
that
her
luck
had
not
altogether
deserted
her
one
conversation
with
citizen
chauvelin
had
brought
the
fickle
jade
back
to
demoiselle
candeilles
'
service
nay
more
the
young
actress
saw
before
her
visions
of
intrigue
of
dramatic
situations
of
pleasant
little
bits
of
revenge
all
of
which
was
meat
and
drink
and
air
to
breathe
for
mademoiselle
desiree
she
was
to
sing
in
one
of
the
most
fashionable
salons
in
england
that
was
very
pleasant
the
prince
of
wales
would
hear
and
see
her
that
opened
out
a
vista
of
delightful
possibilities
and
all
she
had
to
do
was
to
act
a
part
dictated
to
her
by
citizen
chauvelin
to
behave
as
he
directed
to
move
in
the
way
he
wished
well
that
was
easy
enough
since
the
part
which
she
would
have
to
play
was
one
peculiarly
suited
to
her
talents
she
looked
at
herself
critically
in
the
glass
her
maid
fanchon
a
little
french
waif
picked
up
in
the
slums
of
soho
helped
to
readjust
a
stray
curl
which
had
rebelled
against
the
comb
now
for
the
necklace
mademoiselle
said
fanchon
with
suppressed
excitement
it
had
just
arrived
by
messenger
a
large
morocco
case
which
now
lay
open
on
the
dressing
table
displaying
its
dazzling
contents
candeille
scarcely
dared
to
touch
it
and
yet
it
was
for
her
citizen
chauvelin
had
sent
a
note
with
it
citizeness
candeille
will
please
accept
this
gift
from
the
government
of
france
in
acknowledgment
of
useful
services
past
and
to
come
the
note
was
signed
with
robespierre
'
s
own
name
followed
by
that
of
citizen
chauvelin
the
morocco
case
contained
a
necklace
of
diamonds
worth
the
ransom
of
a
king
for
useful
services
past
and
to
come
and
there
were
promises
of
still
further
rewards
a
complete
pardon
for
all
defalcations
a
place
within
the
charmed
circle
of
the
comedie
francaise
a
grand
pageant
and
apotheosis
with
citizeness
candeille
impersonating
the
goddess
of
reason
in
the
midst
of
a
grand
national
fete
and
the
acclamations
of
excited
paris
and
all
in
exchange
for
the
enactment
of
a
part
simple
and
easy
outlined
for
her
by
chauvelin
how
strange
how
inexplicable
candeille
took
the
necklace
up
in
her
trembling
fingers
and
gazed
musingly
at
the
priceless
gems
she
had
seen
the
jewels
before
long
long
ago
round
the
neck
of
the
duchesse
de
marny
in
whose
service
her
own
mother
had
been
she
as
a
child
had
often
gazed
at
and
admired
the
great
lady
who
seemed
like
a
wonderful
fairy
from
an
altogether
world
to
the
poor
little
kitchen
slut
how
wonderful
are
the
vagaries
of
fortune
desiree
candeille
the
kitchen
-
maid
'
s
daughter
now
wearing
her
ex
-
mistress
'
jewels
she
supposed
that
these
had
been
confiscated
when
the
last
of
the
marnys
the
girl
juliette
had
escaped
from
france
confiscated
and
now
sent
to
her
candeille
as
a
reward
or
as
a
bribe
in
either
case
they
were
welcome
the
actress
'
vanity
was
soothed
she
knew
juliette
marny
was
in
england
and
that
she
would
meet
her
to
-
night
at
lady
blakeney
'
s
after
the
many
snubs
which
she
had
endured
from
french
aristocrats
settled
in
england
the
actress
felt
that
she
was
about
to
enjoy
an
evening
of
triumph
the
intrigue
excited
her
she
did
not
quite
know
what
schemes
chauvelin
was
aiming
at
what
ultimate
end
he
had
had
in
view
when
he
commanded
her
services
and
taught
her
the
part
which
he
wished
her
to
play
that
the
schemes
were
vast
and
the
end
mighty
she
could
not
doubt
the
reward
she
had
received
was
proof
enough
of
that
little
fanchon
stood
there
in
speechless
admiration
whilst
her
mistress
still
fondly
fingered
the
magnificent
necklace
mademoiselle
will
wear
the
diamond
to
-
night
she
asked
with
evident
anxiety
she
would
have
been
bitterly
disappointed
to
have
seen
the
beautiful
thing
once
more
relegated
to
its
dark
morocco
case
oh
yes
fanchon
said
candeille
with
a
sigh
of
great
satisfaction
see
that
they
are
fastened
quite
securely
my
girl
she
put
the
necklace
round
her
shapely
neck
and
fanchon
looked
to
see
that
the
clasp
was
quite
secure
there
came
the
sound
of
loud
knocking
at
the
street
door
that
is
m
chauvelin
come
to
fetch
me
with
the
chaise
am
i
quite
ready
fanchon
asked
desiree
candeille
oh
yes
mademoiselle
sighed
the
little
maid
and
mademoiselle
looks
very
beautiful
to
-
night
lady
blakeney
is
very
beautiful
too
fanchon
rejoined
the
actress
naively
but
i
wonder
if
she
will
wear
anything
as
fine
as
the
marny
necklace
the
knocking
at
the
street
door
was
repeated
candeille
took
a
final
satisfied
survey
of
herself
in
the
glass
she
knew
her
part
and
felt
that
she
had
dressed
well
for
it
she
gave
a
final
affectionate
little
tap
to
the
diamonds
round
her
neck
took
her
cloak
and
hood
from
fanchon
and
was
ready
to
go
there
are
several
accounts
extant
in
the
fashionable
chronicles
of
the
time
of
the
gorgeous
reception
given
that
autumn
by
lady
blakeney
in
her
magnificent
riverside
home
never
had
the
spacious
apartments
of
blakeney
manor
looked
more
resplendent
than
on
this
memorable
occasion
memorable
because
of
the
events
which
brought
the
brilliant
evening
to
a
close
the
prince
of
wales
had
come
over
by
water
from
carlton
house
the
royal
princesses
came
early
and
all
fashionable
london
was
there
chattering
and
laughing
displaying
elaborate
gowns
and
priceless
jewels
dancing
flirting
listening
to
the
strains
of
the
string
band
or
strolling
listlessly
in
the
gardens
where
the
late
roses
and
clumps
of
heliotrope
threw
soft
fragrance
on
the
balmy
air
but
marguerite
was
nervous
and
agitated
strive
how
she
might
she
could
not
throw
off
that
foreboding
of
something
evil
to
come
which
had
assailed
her
from
the
first
moment
when
she
met
chauvelin
face
to
face
that
unaccountable
feeling
of
unreality
was
still
upon
her
that
sense
that
she
and
the
woman
candeille
percy
and
even
his
royal
highness
were
for
the
time
being
the
actors
in
a
play
written
and
stage
-
managed
by
chauvelin
the
ex
-
ambassador
'
s
humility
his
offers
of
friendship
his
quietude
under
sir
percy
'
s
good
-
humoured
banter
everything
was
a
sham
marguerite
knew
it
her
womanly
instinct
her
passionate
love
all
cried
out
to
her
in
warning
but
there
was
that
in
her
husband
'
s
nature
which
rendered
her
powerless
in
the
face
of
such
dangers
as
she
felt
sure
were
now
threatening
him
just
before
her
guests
had
begun
to
assemble
she
had
been
alone
with
him
for
a
few
minutes
she
had
entered
the
room
in
which
he
sat
looking
radiantly
beautiful
in
a
shimmering
gown
of
white
and
silver
with
diamonds
in
her
golden
hair
and
round
her
exquisite
neck
moments
like
this
when
she
was
alone
with
him
were
the
joy
of
her
life
then
and
then
only
did
she
see
him
as
he
really
was
with
that
wistful
tenderness
in
his
deep
-
set
eyes
that
occasional
flash
of
passion
from
beneath
the
lazily
-
drooping
lids
for
a
few
minutes
seconds
mayhap
the
spirit
of
the
reckless
adventurer
was
laid
to
rest
relegated
into
the
furthermost
background
of
this
senses
by
the
powerful
emotions
of
the
lover
then
he
would
seize
her
in
his
arms
and
hold
her
to
him
with
a
strange
longing
to
tear
from
out
his
heart
all
other
thoughts
feelings
and
passions
save
those
which
made
him
a
slave
to
her
beauty
and
her
smiles
percy
she
whispered
to
him
to
-
night
when
freeing
herself
from
his
embrace
she
looked
up
at
him
and
for
this
one
heavenly
second
felt
him
all
her
own
percy
you
will
do
nothing
rash
nothing
foolhardy
to
-
night
that
man
had
planned
all
that
took
place
yesterday
he
hates
you
and
in
a
moment
his
face
and
attitude
had
changed
the
heavy
lids
drooped
over
the
eyes
the
rigidity
of
the
mouth
relaxed
and
that
quaint
half
-
shy
half
-
inane
smile
played
around
the
firm
lips
of
course
he
does
m
'
dear
he
said
in
his
usual
affected
drawly
tones
of
course
he
does
but
that
is
so
demmed
amusing
he
does
not
really
know
what
or
how
much
he
knows
or
what
i
know
in
fact
er
we
none
of
us
know
anything
just
at
present
he
laughed
lightly
and
carelessly
then
deliberately
readjusted
the
set
of
his
lace
tie
percy
she
said
reproachfully
yes
m
'
dear
lately
when
you
brought
deroulede
and
juliette
marny
to
england
i
endured
agonies
of
anxiety
and
he
sighed
a
quick
short
wistful
sigh
and
said
very
gently
i
know
you
did
m
'
dear
and
that
is
where
the
trouble
lies
i
know
that
you
are
fretting
so
i
have
to
be
so
demmed
quick
about
the
business
so
as
not
to
keep
you
in
suspense
too
long
and
now
i
ca
not
take
ffoulkes
away
from
his
young
wife
and
tony
and
the
others
are
so
mighty
slow
percy
she
said
once
more
with
tender
earnestness
i
know
i
know
he
said
with
a
slight
frown
of
self
-
reproach
la
but
i
do
not
deserve
your
solicitude
heavens
know
what
a
brute
i
was
for
years
whilst
i
neglected
you
and
ignored
the
noble
devotion
which
i
alas
do
even
now
so
little
to
deserve
she
would
have
said
something
more
but
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
juliette
marny
into
the
room
some
of
your
guests
have
arrived
lady
blakeney
said
the
young
girl
apologising
for
her
seeming
intrusion
i
thought
you
would
wish
to
know
juliette
looked
very
young
and
girlish
in
a
simple
white
gown
without
a
single
jewel
on
her
arms
or
neck
marguerite
regarded
her
with
unaffected
approval
you
look
charming
to
-
night
mademoiselle
does
she
not
sir
percy
thanks
to
your
bounty
smiled
juliette
a
trifle
sadly
whilst
i
dressed
to
-
night
i
felt
how
i
should
have
loved
to
wear
my
dear
mother
'
s
jewels
of
which
she
used
to
be
so
proud
we
must
hope
that
you
will
recover
them
dear
some
day
said
marguerite
vaguely
as
she
led
the
young
girl
out
of
the
small
study
towards
the
larger
reception
rooms
indeed
i
hope
so
sighed
juliette
when
times
became
so
troublous
in
france
after
my
dear
father
'
s
death
his
confessor
and
friend
the
abbe
foucquet
took
charge
of
all
my
mother
'
s
jewels
for
me
he
said
they
would
be
safe
with
the
ornaments
of
his
own
little
church
at
boulogne
he
feared
no
sacrilege
and
thought
they
would
be
most
effectually
hidden
there
for
no
one
would
dream
of
looking
for
the
marny
diamonds
in
the
crypt
of
a
country
church
marguerite
said
nothing
in
reply
whatever
her
own
doubts
might
be
upon
such
a
subject
it
could
serve
no
purpose
to
disturb
the
young
girl
'
s
serenity
dear
abbe
foucquet
said
juliette
after
a
while
his
is
the
kind
of
devotion
which
i
feel
sure
will
never
be
found
under
the
new
regimes
of
anarchy
and
of
so
-
called
equality
he
would
have
laid
down
his
life
for
my
father
or
for
me
and
i
know
that
he
would
never
part
with
the
jewels
which
i
entrusted
to
his
care
whilst
he
had
breath
and
strength
to
defend
them
marguerite
would
have
wished
to
pursue
the
subject
a
little
further
it
was
very
pathetic
to
witness
poor
juliette
'
s
hopes
and
confidences
which
she
felt
sure
would
never
be
realised
lady
blakeney
knew
so
much
of
what
was
going
on
in
france
just
now
spoliations
confiscations
official
thefts
open
robberies
all
in
the
name
of
equality
of
fraternity
and
of
patriotism
she
knew
nothing
of
course
of
the
abbe
foucquet
but
the
tender
little
picture
of
the
devoted
old
man
painted
by
juliette
'
s
words
had
appealed
strongly
to
her
sympathetic
heart
instinct
and
knowledge
of
the
political
aspect
of
france
told
her
that
by
entrusting
valuable
family
jewels
to
the
old
abbe
juliette
had
most
unwittingly
placed
the
man
she
so
much
trusted
in
danger
of
persecution
at
the
hands
of
a
government
which
did
not
even
admit
the
legality
of
family
possessions
however
there
was
neither
time
nor
opportunity
now
to
enlarge
upon
the
subject
marguerite
resolved
to
recur
to
it
a
little
later
when
she
would
be
alone
with
mlle
de
marny
and
above
all
when
she
could
take
counsel
with
her
husband
as
to
the
best
means
of
recovering
the
young
girl
'
s
property
for
her
whilst
relieving
a
devoted
old
man
from
the
dangerous
responsibility
which
he
had
so
selflessly
undertaken
in
the
meanwhile
the
two
women
had
reached
the
first
of
the
long
line
of
state
apartments
wherein
the
brilliant
fete
was
to
take
place
the
staircase
and
the
hall
below
were
already
filled
with
the
early
arrivals
bidding
juliette
to
remain
in
the
ballroom
lady
blakeney
now
took
up
her
stand
on
the
exquisitely
decorated
landing
ready
to
greet
her
guests
she
had
a
smile
and
a
pleasant
word
for
all
as
in
a
constant
stream
the
elite
of
london
fashionable
society
began
to
file
past
her
exchanging
the
elaborate
greetings
which
the
stilted
mode
of
the
day
prescribed
to
this
butterfly
-
world
the
lacqueys
in
the
hall
shouted
the
names
of
the
guests
as
they
passed
up
the
stairs
names
celebrated
in
politics
in
worlds
of
sport
of
science
or
of
art
great
historic
names

newly
-
made

the
spacious
rooms
were
filling
fast
his
royal
highness
so
'
twas
said
had
just
stepped
out
of
his
barge
the
noise
of
laughter
and
chatter
was
incessant
like
unto
a
crowd
of
gaily
-
plumaged
birds
huge
bunches
of
apricot
-
coloured
roses
in
silver

the

with
their
subtle
perfume

began
to
flutter
the
string
band
struck
the
preliminary
cords
of
the
gavotte
at
that
moment
the
lacqueys
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
called
out
in
stentorian
tones
mademoiselle
desiree
candeille
and
monsieur
chauvelin
marguerite
'
s
heart
gave
a
slight
flutter
she
felt
a
sudden
tightening
of
the
throat
she
did
not
see
candeille
at
first
only
the
slight
figure
of
chauvelin
dressed
all
in
black
as
usual
with
head
bent
and
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
he
was
slowly
mounting
the
wide
staircase
between
a
double
row
of
brilliantly
attired
men
and
women
who
looked
with
no
small
measure
of
curiosity
at
the
ex
-
ambassador
from
revolutionary
france
demoiselle
candeille
was
leading
the
way
up
the
stairs
she
paused
on
the
landing
in
order
to
make
before
her
hostess
a
most
perfect
and
most
elaborate
curtsey
she
looked
smiling
and
radiant
beautifully
dressed
a
small
wreath
of
wrought
gold
leaves
in
her
hair
her
only
jewel
an
absolutely
regal
one
a
magnificent
necklace
of
diamonds
round
her
shapely
throat
it
all
occurred
just
before
midnight
in
one
of
the
smaller
rooms
which
lead
in
enfilade
from
the
principal
ballroom
dancing
had
been
going
on
for
some
time
but
the
evening
was
close
and
there
seemed
to
be
a
growing
desire
on
the
part
of
lady
blakeney
'
s
guests
to
wander
desultorily
through
the
gardens
and
glasshouses
or
sit
about
where
some
measure
of
coolness
could
be
obtained
there
was
a
rumour
that
a
new
and
charming
french
artiste
was
to
sing
a
few
peculiarly
ravishing
songs
unheard
in
england
before
close
to
the
main
ballroom
was
the
octagon
music
-
room
which
was
brilliantly
illuminated
and
in
which
a
large
number
of
chairs
had
been
obviously
disposed
for
the
comfort
of
an
audience
into
this
room
many
of
the
guests
had
already
assembled
it
was
quite
clear
that
a
chamber
-
concert
-
-
select
and
attractive
as
were
all
lady
blakeney
'
s
entertainments
was
in
contemplation
marguerite
herself
released
for
a
moment
from
her
constant
duties
near
her
royal
guests
had
strolled
through
the
smaller
rooms
accompanied
by
juliette
in
order
to
search
for
mademoiselle
candeille
and
to
suggest
the
commencement
of
the
improvised
concert
desiree
candeille
had
kept
herself
very
much
aloof
throughout
the
evening
only
talking
to
the
one
or
two
gentlemen
whom
her
hostess
had
presented
to
her
on
her
arrival
and
with
m
chauvelin
always
in
close
attendance
upon
her
every
movement
presently
when
dancing
began
she
retired
to
a
small
boudoir
and
there
sat
down
demurely
waiting
until
lady
blakeney
should
require
her
services
when
marguerite
and
juliette
marny
entered
the
little
room
she
rose
and
came
forward
a
few
steps
i
am
ready
madame
she
said
pleasantly
whenever
you
wish
me
to
begin
i
have
thought
out
a
short
programme
shall
i
start
with
the
gay
or
the
sentimental
songs
but
before
marguerite
had
time
to
utter
a
reply
she
felt
her
arm
nervously
clutched
by
a
hot
and
trembling
hand
who
who
is
this
woman
murmured
juliette
marny
close
to
her
ear
the
young
girl
looked
pale
and
very
agitated
and
her
large
eyes
were
fixed
in
unmistakable
wrath
upon
the
french
actress
before
her
a
little
startled
not
understanding
juliette
'
s
attitude
marguerite
tried
to
reply
lightly
this
is
mademoiselle
candeille
juliette
dear
she
said
affecting
the
usual
formal
introduction
of
the
varietes
theatre
of
paris
mademoiselle
desiree
candeille
who
will
sing
some
charming
french
ditties
for
us
to
-
night
while
she
spoke
she
kept
a
restraining
hand
on
juliette
'
s
quivering
arm
already
with
the
keen
intuition
which
had
been
on
the
qui
-
vive
the
whole
evening
she
scented
some
mystery
in
this
sudden
outburst
on
the
part
of
her
young
protegee
but
juliette
did
not
heed
her
she
felt
surging
up
in
her
young
overburdened
heart
all
the
wrath
and
the
contempt
of
the
persecuted
fugitive
aristocrat
against
the
triumphant
usurper
she
had
suffered
so
much
from
that
particular
class
of
the
risen
kitchen
-
wench
of
which
the
woman
before
her
was
so
typical
and
example
years
of
sorrow
of
poverty
were
behind
her
loss
of
fortune
of
kindred
of
friends
she
even
now
a
pauper
living
on
the
bounty
of
strangers
and
all
this
through
no
fault
of
her
own
the
fault
of
her
class
mayhap
but
not
hers
she
had
suffered
much
and
was
still
overwrought
and
nerve
-
strung
for
some
reason
she
could
not
afterwards
have
explained
she
felt
spiteful
and
uncontrolled
goaded
into
stupid
fury
by
the
look
of
insolence
and
of
triumph
with
which
candeille
calmly
regarded
her
afterwards
she
would
willingly
have
bitten
out
her
tongue
for
her
vehemence
but
for
the
moment
she
was
absolutely
incapable
of
checking
the
torrent
of
her
own
emotions
mademoiselle
candeille
indeed
she
said
in
wrathful
scorn
desiree
candeille
you
mean
lady
blakeney
my
mother
'
s
kitchen
-
maid
flaunting
shamelessly
my
dear
mother
'
s
jewels
which
she
has
stolen
mayhap
the
young
girl
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
tears
of
anger
obscured
her
eyes
her
voice
which
fortunately
remained
low
not
much
above
a
whisper
was
thick
and
husky
juliette
juliette
i
entreat
you
admonished
marguerite
you
must
control
yourself
you
must
indeed
you
must
mademoiselle
candeille
i
beg
of
you
to
retire
but
candeille
well
-
schooled
in
the
part
she
had
to
play
had
no
intention
of
quitting
the
field
of
battle
the
more
wrathful
and
excited
mademoiselle
de
marny
became
the
more
insolent
and
triumphant
waxed
the
young
actress
'
whole
attitude
an
ironical
smile
played
round
the
corners
of
her
mouth
her
almond
-
shaped
eyes
were
half
-
closed
regarding
through
dropping
lashed
the
trembling
figure
of
the
young
impoverished
aristocrat
her
head
was
thrown
well
back
in
obvious
defiance
of
the
social
conventions
which
should
have
forbidden
a
fracas
in
lady
blakeney
'
s
hospitable
house
and
her
fingers
provocatively
toyed
with
the
diamond
necklace
which
glittered
and
sparkled
round
her
throat
she
had
no
need
to
repeat
the
words
of
a
well
-
learnt
part
her
own
wit
her
own
emotions
and
feelings
helped
her
to
act
just
as
her
employer
would
have
wished
her
to
do
her
native
vulgarity
helped
her
to
assume
the
very
bearing
which
he
would
have
desired
in
fact
at
this
moment
desiree
candeille
had
forgotten
everything
save
the
immediate
present
a
more
than
contemptuous
snub
from
one
of
those
penniless
aristocrats
who
had
rendered
her
own
sojourn
in
london
so
unpleasant
and
unsuccessful
she
had
suffered
from
these
snubs
before
but
had
never
had
the
chance
of
forcing
an
esclandre
as
a
result
of
her
own
humiliation
that
spirit
of
hatred
for
the
rich
and
idle
classes
which
was
so
characteristic
of
revolutionary
france
was
alive
and
hot
within
her
she
had
never
had
an
opportunity
she
the
humble
fugitive
actress
from
a
minor
paris
theatre
to
retort
with
forcible
taunts
to
the
ironical
remarks
made
at
and
before
her
by
the
various
poverty
-
stricken
but
haughty
emigres
who
swarmed
in
those
very
same
circles
of
london
society
into
which
she
herself
had
vainly
striven
to
penetrate
now
at
last
one
of
this
same
hated
class
provoked
beyond
self
-
control
was
allowing
childish
and
unreasoning
fury
to
outstrip
the
usual
calm
irony
of
aristocratic
rebuffs
juliette
had
paused
awhile
in
order
to
check
the
wrathful
tears
which
much
against
her
will
were
choking
the
words
in
her
throat
and
blinding
her
eyes
hoity
toity
laughed
candeille
hark
at
the
young
baggage
but
juliette
had
turned
to
marguerite
and
began
explaining
volubly
my
mother
'
s
jewels
she
said
in
the
midst
of
her
tears
ask
her
how
she
came
by
them
when
i
was
obliged
to
leave
the
home
of
my
fathers
stolen
from
me
by
the
revolutionary
government
i
contrived
to
retain
my
mother
'
s
jewels
you
remember
i
told
you
just
now
the
abbe
foucquet
dear
old
man
saved
them
for
me
that
and
a
little
money
which
i
had
he
took
charge
of
them
he
said
he
would
place
them
in
safety
with
the
ornaments
of
his
church
and
now
i
see
them
round
that
woman
'
s
neck
i
know
that
he
would
not
have
parted
with
them
save
with
his
life
all
the
while
that
the
young
girl
spoke
in
a
voice
half
-
choked
with
sobs
marguerite
tried
with
all
the
physical
and
mental
will
at
her
command
to
drag
her
out
of
the
room
and
thus
to
put
a
summary
ending
to
this
unpleasant
scene
she
ought
to
have
felt
angry
with
juliette
for
this
childish
and
senseless
outburst
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
somehow
she
knew
within
her
innermost
heart
that
all
this
had
been
arranged
and
preordained
not
by
fate
not
by
a
higher
hand
but
by
the
most
skilful
intriguer
present
-
day
france
had
ever
known
and
even
now
as
she
was
half
succeeding
in
turning
juliette
away
from
the
sight
of
candeille
she
was
not
the
least
surprised
or
startled
at
seeing
chauvelin
standing
in
the
very
doorway
through
which
she
had
hoped
to
pass
once
glance
at
his
face
had
made
her
fears
tangible
and
real
there
was
a
look
of
satisfaction
and
triumph
in
his
pale
narrow
eyes
a
flash
in
them
of
approbation
directed
at
the
insolent
attitude
of
the
french
actress
he
looked
like
the
stage
-
manager
of
a
play
content
with
the
effect
his
own
well
-
arranged
scenes
were
producing
what
he
hoped
to
gain
by
this
somewhat
vulgar
quarrel
between
the
two
women
marguerite
of
course
could
not
guess
that
something
was
lurking
in
his
mind
inimical
to
herself
and
to
her
husband
she
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
and
at
this
moment
she
felt
that
she
would
have
given
her
very
life
to
induce
candeille
and
juliette
to
cease
this
passage
of
arms
without
further
provocation
on
either
side
but
though
juliette
might
have
been
ready
to
yield
to
lady
blakeney
'
s
persuasion
desiree
candeille
under
chauvelin
'
s
eye
and
fired
by
her
own
desire
to
further
humiliate
this
overbearing
aristocrat
did
not
wish
the
little
scene
to
end
so
tamely
just
yet
your
old
calotin
was
made
to
part
with
his
booty
m
'
dear
she
said
with
a
contemptuous
shrug
of
her
bare
shoulders
paris
and
france
have
been
starving
these
many
years
past
a
paternal
government
seized
all
it
could
with
which
to
reward
those
that
served
it
well
whilst
all
that
would
have
been
brought
bread
and
meat
for
the
poor
was
being
greedily
stowed
away
by
shameless
traitors
juliette
winced
at
the
insult
oh
she
moaned
as
she
buried
her
flaming
face
in
her
hands
too
late
now
did
she
realise
that
she
had
deliberately
stirred
up
a
mud
-
heap
and
sent
noisome
insects
buzzing
about
her
ears
mademoiselle
said
marguerite
authoritatively
i
must
ask
you
to
remember
that
mlle
de
marny
is
my
friend
and
that
you
are
a
guest
in
my
house
aye
i
try
not
to
forget
it
rejoined
candeille
lightly
but
of
a
truth
you
must
admit
citizeness
that
it
would
require
the
patience
of
a
saint
to
put
up
with
the
insolence
of
a
penniless
baggage
who
but
lately
has
had
to
stand
her
trial
in
her
own
country
for
impurity
of
conduct
there
was
a
moment
'
s
silence
whilst
marguerite
distinctly
heard
a
short
sigh
of
satisfaction
escaping
from
the
lips
of
chauvelin
then
a
pleasant
laugh
broke
upon
the
ears
of
the
four
actors
who
were
enacting
the
dramatic
little
scene
and
sir
percy
blakeney
immaculate
in
his
rich
white
satin
coat
and
filmy
lace
ruffles
exquisite
in
manners
and
courtesy
entered
the
little
boudoir
and
with
his
long
back
slightly
bent
his
arm
outstretched
in
a
graceful
and
well
-
studied
curve
he
approached
mademoiselle
desiree
candeille
may
i
have
the
honour
he
said
with
his
most
elaborate
air
of
courtly
deference
of
conducting
mademoiselle
to
her
chaise
in
the
doorway
just
behind
him
stood
his
royal
highness
the
prince
of
wales
chatting
with
apparent
carelessness
to
sir
andrew
ffoulkes
and
lord
anthony
dewhurst
a
curtain
beyond
the
open
door
was
partially
drawn
aside
disclosing
one
or
two
brilliantly
dressed
groups
strolling
desultorily
through
the
further
rooms
the
four
persons
assembled
in
the
little
boudoir
had
been
so
absorbed
by
their
own
passionate
emotions
and
the
violence
of
their
quarrel
that
they
had
not
noticed
the
approach
of
sir
percy
blakeney
and
of
his
friends
juliette
and
marguerite
certainly
were
startled
and
candeille
was
evidently
taken
unawares
chauvelin
alone
seemed
quite
indifferent
and
stood
back
a
little
when
sir
percy
advanced
in
order
to
allow
him
to
pass
but
candeille
recovered
quickly
enough
from
her
surprise
without
heeding
blakeney
'
s
proffered
arm
she
turned
with
all
the
airs
of
an
insulted
tragedy
queen
towards
marguerite
so
'
tis
i
she
said
with
affected
calm
who
am
to
bear
every
insult
in
a
house
in
which
i
was
bidden
as
a
guest
i
am
turned
out
like
some
intrusive
and
importunate
beggar
and
i
the
stranger
in
this
land
am
destined
to
find
that
amidst
all
these
brilliant
english
gentlemen
there
is
not
one
man
of
honour
m
chauvelin
she
added
loudly
our
beautiful
country
has
meseems
deputed
you
to
guard
the
honour
as
well
as
the
worldly
goods
of
your
unprotected
compatriots
i
call
upon
you
in
the
name
of
france
to
avenge
the
insults
offered
to
me
to
-
night
she
looked
round
defiantly
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
several
faces
which
were
now
turned
towards
her
but
no
one
for
the
moment
spoke
or
stirred
juliette
silent
and
ashamed
had
taken
marguerite
'
s
hand
in
hers
and
was
clinging
to
it
as
if
wishing
to
draw
strength
of
character
and
firmness
of
purpose
through
the
pores
of
the
other
woman
'
s
delicate
skin
sir
percy
with
backbone
still
bent
in
a
sweeping
curve
had
not
relaxed
his
attitude
of
uttermost
deference
the
prince
of
wales
and
his
friends
were
viewing
the
scene
with
slightly
amused
aloofness
for
a
moment
seconds
at
most
there
was
dead
silence
in
the
room
during
which
time
it
almost
seemed
as
if
the
beating
of
several
hearts
could
be
distinctly
heard
then
chauvelin
courtly
and
urbane
stepped
calmly
forward
believe
me
citizeness
he
said
addressing
candeille
directly
and
with
marked
emphasis
i
am
entirely
at
your
command
but
am
i
not
helpless
seeing
that
those
who
have
so
grossly
insulted
you
are
of
your
own
irresponsible
if
charming
sex
like
a
great
dog
after
a
nap
sir
percy
blakeney
straightened
his
long
back
and
stretched
it
out
to
its
full
length
la
he
said
pleasantly
my
ever
engaging
friend
from
calais
sir
your
servant
meseems
we
are
ever
destined
to
discuss
amiable
matters
in
an
amiable
spirit
a
glass
of
punch
monsieur
er
chauvelin
i
must
ask
you
sir
percy
rejoined
chauvelin
sternly
to
view
this
matter
with
becoming
seriousness
seriousness
is
never
becoming
sir
said
blakeney
politely
smothering
a
slight
yawn
and
it
is
vastly
unbecoming
in
the
presence
of
ladies
am
i
to
understand
then
sir
percy
said
chauvelin
that
you
are
prepared
to
apologize
to
mademoiselle
candeille
for
this
insults
offered
to
her
by
lady
blakeney
sir
percy
again
tried
to
smother
that
tiresome
little
yawn
which
seemed
most
distressing
when
he
desired
to
be
most
polite
then
he
flicked
off
a
grain
of
dust
from
his
immaculate
lace
ruffle
and
buried
his
long
slender
hands
in
the
capacious
pockets
of
his
white
satin
breeches
finally
he
said
with
the
most
good
-
natured
of
smiles
sir
have
you
seen
the
latest
fashion
in
cravats
i
would
wish
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
novel
way
in
which
we
in
england
tie
a
mechlin
-
edged
bow
sir
percy
retorted
chauvelin
firmly
since
you
will
not
offer
mademoiselle
candeille
the
apology
which
she
has
the
right
to
expect
from
you
are
you
prepared
that
you
and
i
should
cross
swords
like
honourable
gentlemen
blakeney
laughed
his
usual
pleasant
somewhat
shy
laugh
shook
his
powerful
frame
and
looked
from
his
altitude
of
six
feet
three
inches
down
on
the
small
sable
-
clad
figure
of
ex
-
ambassador
chauvelin
the
question
is
sir
he
said
slowly
should
we
then
be
two
honourable
gentlemen
crossing
swords
sir
percy
sir
chauvelin
who
for
one
moment
had
seemed
ready
to
lose
his
temper
now
made
a
sudden
effort
to
resume
a
calm
and
easy
attitude
and
said
quietly
of
course
if
one
of
us
is
coward
enough
to
shirk
the
contest
he
did
not
complete
the
sentence
but
shrugged
his
shoulders
expressive
of
contempt
the
other
side
of
the
curtained
doorway
a
little
crowd
had
gradually
assembled
attracted
hither
by
the
loud
and
angry
voices
which
came
from
that
small
boudoir
host
and
hostess
had
been
missed
from
the
reception
rooms
for
some
time
his
royal
highness
too
had
not
been
seen
for
the
quarter
of
an
hour
like
flies
attracted
by
the
light
one
by
one
or
in
small
isolated
groups
some
of
lady
blakeney
'
s
quests
had
found
their
way
to
the
room
adjoining
the
royal
presence
as
his
highness
was
standing
in
the
doorway
itself
no
one
could
of
course
cross
the
threshold
but
everyone
could
see
into
the
room
and
could
take
stock
of
the
various
actors
in
the
little
comedy
they
were
witnessing
a
quarrel
between
the
french
envoy
and
sir
percy
blakeney
wherein
the
former
was
evidently
in
deadly
earnest
and
the
latter
merely
politely
bored
amused
comments
flew
to
and
fro
laughter
and
a
babel
of
irresponsible
chatter
made
an
incessant
chirruping
accompaniment
to
the
duologue
between
the
two
men
but
at
this
stage
the
prince
of
wales
who
hitherto
had
seemingly
kept
aloof
from
the
quarrel
suddenly
stepped
forward
and
abruptly
interposed
the
weight
of
his
authority
and
of
his
social
position
between
the
bickering
adversaries
tush
man
he
said
impatiently
turning
more
especially
towards
chauvelin
you
talk
at
random
sir
percy
blakeney
is
an
english
gentleman
and
the
laws
of
this
country
do
not
admit
of
duelling
as
you
understand
it
in
france
and
i
for
one
certainly
could
not
allow
pardon
your
royal
highness
interrupted
sir
percy
with
irresistible
bonhomie
your
highness
does
not
understand
the
situation
my
engaging
friend
here
does
not
propose
that
i
should
transgress
the
laws
of
this
country
but
that
i
should
go
over
to
france
with
him
and
fight
him
there
where
duelling
and
er
other
little
matters
of
that
sort
are
allowed
yes
quite
so
rejoined
the
prince
i
understand
m
chauvelin
'
s
desire
but
what
about
you
blakeney
oh
replied
sir
percy
lightly
i
have
accepted
his
challenge
of
course
it
would
be
very
difficult
indeed
to
say
why
at
blakeney
'
s
lightly
spoken
words
an
immediate
silence
should
have
fallen
upon
all
those
present
all
the
actors
in
the
little
drawing
-
room
drama
who
had
played
their
respective
parts
so
unerringly
up
to
now
had
paused
a
while
just
as
if
an
invisible
curtain
had
come
down
marking
the
end
of
a
scene
and
the
interval
during
which
the
players
might
recover
strength
and
energy
to
resume
their
roles
the
prince
of
wales
as
foremost
spectator
said
nothing
for
the
moment
and
beyond
the
doorway
the
audience
there
assembled
seemed
suddenly
to
be
holding
its
breath
waiting
eager
expectant
palpitation
for
what
would
follow
now
only
here
and
there
the
gentle
frou
-
frou
of
a
silk
skirt
the
rhythmic
flutter
of
a
fan
broke
those
few
seconds
'
deadly
stony
silence
yet
it
was
all
simple
enough
a
fracas
between
two
ladies
the
gentlemen
interposing
a
few
words
of
angry
expostulation
then
the
inevitable
suggestion
of
belgium
or
of
some
other
country
where
the
childish
and
barbarous
custom
of
settling
such
matters
with
a
couple
of
swords
had
not
been
as
yet
systematically
stamped
out
the
whole
scene
with
but
slight
variations
had
occurred
scores
of
times
in
london
drawing
-
rooms
english
gentlemen
had
scores
of
times
crossed
the
channel
for
the
purpose
of
settling
similar
quarrels
in
continental
fashion
why
should
the
present
situation
appear
so
abnormal
sir
percy
blakeney
an
accomplished
gentleman
was
past
master
in
the
art
of
fence
and
looked
more
than
a
match
in
strength
and
dexterity
for
the
meagre
sable
-
clad
little
opponent
who
had
so
summarily
challenged
him
to
cross
over
to
france
in
order
to
fight
a
duel
but
somehow
everyone
had
a
feeling
at
this
moment
that
this
proposed
duel
would
be
unlike
any
other
combat
every
fought
between
two
antagonists
perhaps
it
was
the
white
absolutely
stony
and
unexpressive
face
of
marguerite
which
suggested
a
latent
tragedy
perhaps
it
was
the
look
of
unmistakable
horror
in
juliette
'
s
eyes
or
that
of
triumph
in
those
of
chauvelin
or
even
that
certain
something
in
his
royal
highness
'
face
which
seemed
to
imply
that
the
prince
careless
man
of
the
world
as
he
was
would
have
given
much
to
prevent
this
particular
meeting
from
taking
place
be
that
as
it
may
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
certain
wave
of
electrical
excitement
swept
over
the
little
crowd
assembled
there
the
while
the
chief
actor
in
the
little
drama
the
inimitable
dandy
sir
percy
blakeney
himself
appeared
deeply
engrossed
in
removing
a
speck
of
powder
from
the
wide
black
satin
ribbon
which
held
his
gold
-
rimmed

his

suddenly
we

my

hastings
he
added
turning
to
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
stood
close
to
him
i
pray
you
to

unpardonable

sir
percy
looked
up
from
his
absorbing
occupation
his
eyes
met
those
of
his
wife
she
was
like
a
marble
statue
hardly
conscious
of
what
was
going
on
round
her
but
he
who
knew
every
emotion
which
swayed
that
ardent
and
passionate
nature
guessed
that
beneath
that
stony
calm
there
lay
a
mad
almost
unconquerable
impulse
and
that
was
to
shout
to
all
these
puppets
here
the
truth
the
awful
the
unanswerable
truth
to
tell
them
what
this
challenge
really
meant
a
trap
wherein
one
man
consumed
with
hatred
and
desire
for
revenge
hoped
to
entice
a
brave
and
fearless
foe
into
a
death
-
dealing
snare
full
well
did
percy
blakeney
guess
that
for
the
space
of
one
second
his
most
cherished
secret
hovered
upon
his
wife
'
s
lips
one
turn
of
the
balance
of
fate
one
breath
from
the
mouth
of
an
unseen
sprite
and
marguerite
was
ready
to
shout
do
not
allow
this
monstrous
thing
to
be
the
scarlet
pimpernel
whom
you
all
admire
for
his
bravery
and
love
for
his
daring
stands
before
you
now
face
to
face
with
his
deadliest
enemy
who
is
here
to
lure
him
to
his
doom
for
that
momentous
second
therefore
percy
blakeney
held
his
wife
'
s
gaze
with
the
magnetism
of
his
own
all
there
was
in
him
of
love
of
entreaty
of
trust
and
of
command
went
out
to
her
through
that
look
with
which
he
kept
her
eyes
riveted
upon
his
face
then
he
saw
the
rigidity
of
her
attitude
relax
she
closed
her
eyes
in
order
to
shut
out
the
whole
world
from
her
suffering
soul
she
seemed
to
be
gathering
all
the
mental
force
of
which
her
brain
was
capable
for
one
great
effort
of
self
-
control
then
she
took
juliette
'
s
hand
in
hers
and
turned
to
go
out
of
the
room
the
gentlemen
bowed
as
she
swept
past
them
her
rich
silken
gown
making
a
soft
hush
-
sh
-
sh
as
she
went
she
nodded
to
some
curtseyed
to
the
prince
and
had
at
the
last
moment

supreme
courage
and
pride
