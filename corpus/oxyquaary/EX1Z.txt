`
come
here
`
yes
sir
crass
came
hurrying
along
`
what
'
s
the
meaning
of
this
did
not
i
tell
you
to
make
this
do
with
one
coat
look
at
it
`
it
is
like
this
sir
said
crass
`
if
it
had
been
washed
down
'
`
washed
down
be
damned
shouted
hunter
`
the
reason
is
that
the
colour
ai
not
thick
enough
take
the
paint
and
put
a
little
more
body
in
it
and
we
will
soon
see
whether
it
can
be
done
or
not
i
can
make
it
cover
if
you
ca
not
crass
took
the
paint
and
superintended
by
hunter
made
it
thicker
misery
then
seized
the
brush
and
prepared
to
demonstrate
the
possibility
of
finishing
the
work
with
one
coat
crass
and
sawkins
looked
on
in
silence
just
as
misery
was
about
to
commence
he
fancied
he
heard
someone
whispering
somewhere
he
laid
down
the
brush
and
crawled
stealthily
upstairs
to
see
who
it
was
directly
his
back
was
turned
crass
seized
a
bottle
of
oil
that
was
standing
near
and
tipping
about
half
a
pint
of
it
into
the
paint
stirred
it
up
quickly
misery
returned
almost
immediately
he
had
not
caught
anyone
it
must
have
been
fancy
he
took
up
the
brush
and
began
to
paint
the
result
was
worse
than
sawkins
he
messed
and
fooled
about
for
some
time
but
could
not
make
it
come
right
at
last
he
gave
it
up
`
i
suppose
it
will
have
to
have
two
coats
after
all
he
said
mournfully
`
but
it
is
a
thousand
pities
he
almost
wept
the
firm
would
be
ruined
if
things
went
on
like
this
`
you
'
d
better
go
on
with
it
he
said
as
he
laid
down
the
brush
he
began
to
walk
about
the
house
again
he
wanted
to
go
away
now
but
he
did
not
want
them
to
know
that
he
was
gone
so
he
sneaked
out
of
the
back
door
crept
around
the
house
and
out
of
the
gate
mounted
his
bicycle
and
rode
away
no
one
saw
him
go
for
some
time
the
only
sounds
that
broke
the
silence
were
the
noises
made
by
the
hands
as
they
worked
the
musical
ringing
of
bundy
'
s
trowel
the
noise
of
the
carpenters
'
hammers
and
saws
and
the
occasional
moving
of
a
pair
of
steps
no
one
dared
to
speak
at
last
philpot
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
was
very
thirsty
he
had
kept
the
door
of
his
room
open
since
hunter
arrived
he
listened
intently
he
felt
certain
that
hunter
must
be
gone
he
looked
across
the
landing
and
could
see
owen
working
in
the
front
room
philpot
made
a
little
ball
of
paper
and
threw
it
at
him
to
attract
his
attention
owen
looked
round
and
philpot
began
to
make
signals
he
pointed
downwards
with
one
hand
and
jerked
the
thumb
of
the
other
over
his
shoulder
in
the
direction
of
the
town
winking
grotesquely
the
while
this
owen
interpreted
to
be
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
hunter
had
departed
he
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
to
intimate
that
he
did
not
know
philpot
cautiously
crossed
the
landing
and
peeped
furtively
over
the
banisters
listening
breathlessly
`
was
it
gorn
or
not
he
wondered
he
crept
along
on
tiptoe
towards
owen
'
s
room
glancing
left
and
right
the
trowel
in
his
hand
and
looking
like
a
stage
murderer
`
do
you
think
it
is
gorn
he
asked
in
a
hoarse
whisper
when
he
reached
owen
'
s
door
`
i
do
not
know
replied
owen
in
a
low
tone
philpot
wondered
he
must
have
a
drink
but
it
would
never
do
for
hunter
to
see
him
with
the
bottle
he
must
find
out
somehow
whether
he
was
gone
or
not
at
last
an
idea
came
he
would
go
downstairs
to
get
some
more
cement
having
confided
this
plan
to
owen
he
crept
quietly
back
to
the
room
in
which
he
had
been
working
then
he
walked
noisily
across
the
landing
again
`
got
a
bit
of
stopping
to
spare
frank
he
asked
in
a
loud
voice
`
no
replied
owen
`
i
am
not
using
it
`
then
i
suppose
i
will
have
to
go
down
and
get
some
is
there
anything
i
can
bring
up
for
you
`
no
thanks
replied
owen
philpot
marched
boldly
down
to
the
scullery
which
crass
had
utilized
as
a
paint
-
shop
crass
was
there
mixing
some
colour
`
i
want
a
bit
of
stopping
philpot
said
as
he
helped
himself
to
some
`
is
the
b
r
gorn
whispered
crass
`
i
do
not

replied
philpot
`
where

his

`
'

always
leaves
it
outside
the
gate
so

replied
crass
`
tell
you
what
whispered
philpot
after
a
pause
`
give
the

a

was
done
bert
went
to
the

and
returned
almost
immediately
the
bike
was
gone
as
the
good
news
spread
through
the
house
a
chorus
of
thanksgiving
burst
forth

cried
a
third
directly
they
knew
for
certain
that
he
was
gone
nearly
everyone
left
off
work
for
a
few
minutes
to
curse
him
then
they
again
went
on
working
and
now
that
they
were
relieved
of
the
embarrassment
that
misery
'
s
presence
inspired
they
made
better
progress
a
few
of
them
lit
their
pipes
and
smoked
as
they
worked
one
of
these
was
old
jack
linden
he
was
upset
by
the
bullying
he
had
received
and
when
he
noticed
some
of
the
others
smoking
he
thought
he
would
have
a
pipe
it
might
steady
his
nerves
as
a
rule
he
did
not
smoke
when
working
it
was
contrary
to
orders
as
philpot
was
returning
to
work
again
he
paused
for
a
moment
to
whisper
to
linden
with
the
result
that
the
latter
accompanied
him
upstairs
on
reaching
philpot
'
s
room
the
latter
placed
the
step
-
ladder
near
the
cupboard
and
taking
down
the
bottle
of
beer
handed
it
to
linden
with
the
remark
`
get
some
of
that
acrost

matey
it
will
put

while
linden
was
taking
a
hasty
drink
joe
kept
watch
on
the
landing
outside
in
case
hunter
should
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
reappear
when
linden
was
gone
downstairs
again
philpot
having
finished
what
remained
of
the
beer
and
hidden
the
bottle
up
the
chimney
resumed
the
work
of
stopping
up
the
holes
and
cracks
in
the
ceiling
and
walls
he
must
make
a
bit
of
a
show
tonight
or
there
would
be
a
hell
of
a
row
when
misery
came
in
the
morning
owen
worked
on
in
a
disheartened
sullen
way
he
felt
like
a
beaten
dog
he
was
more
indignant
on
poor
old
linden
'
s
account
than
on
his
own
and
was
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
impotence
and
shameful
degradation
all
his
life
it
had
been
the
same
incessant
work
under
similar
more
or
less
humiliating
conditions
and
with
no
more
result
than
being
just
able
to
avoid
starvation
and
the
future
as
far
as
he
could
see
was
as
hopeless
as
the
past
darker
for
there
would
surely
come
a
time
if
he
lived
long
enough
when
he
would
be
unable
to
work
any
more
he
thought
of
his
child
was
he
to
be
a
slave
and
a
drudge
all
his
life
also
it
would
be
better
for
the
boy
to
die
now
as
owen
thought
of
his
child
'
s
future
there
sprung
up
within
him
a
feeling
of
hatred
and
fury
against
the
majority
of
his
fellow
workmen
they
were
the
enemy
those
who
not
only
quietly
submitted
like
so
many
cattle
to
the
existing
state
of
things
but
defended
it
and
opposed
and
ridiculed
any
suggestion
to
alter
it
they
were
the
real
oppressors
the
men
who
spoke
of
themselves
as
`
the
likes
of
us
who
having
lived
in
poverty
and
degradation
all
their
lives
considered
that
what
had
been
good
enough
for
them
was
good
enough
for
the
children
they
had
been
the
cause
of
bringing
into
existence
he
hated
and
despised
them
because
the
calmly
saw
their
children
condemned
to
hard
labour
and
poverty
for
life
and
deliberately
refused
to
make
any
effort
to
secure
for
them
better
conditions
than
those
they
had
themselves
it
was
because
they
were
indifferent
to
the
fate
of
their
children
that
he
would
be
unable
to
secure
a
natural
and
human
life
for
his
it
was
their
apathy
or
active
opposition
that
made
it
impossible
to
establish
a
better
system
of
society
under
which
those
who
did
their
fair
share
of
the
world
'
s
work
would
be
honoured
and
rewarded
instead
of
helping
to
do
this
they
abased
themselves
and
grovelled
before
their
oppressors
and
compelled
and
taught
their
children
to
do
the
same
they
were
the
people
who
were
really
responsible
for
the
continuance
of
the
present
system
owen
laughed
bitterly
to
himself
what
a
very
comical
system
it
was
those
who
worked
were
looked
upon
with
contempt
and
subjected
to
every
possible
indignity
nearly
everything
they
produced
was
taken
away
from
them
and
enjoyed
by
the
people
who
did
nothing
and
then
the
workers
bowed
down
and
grovelled
before
those
who
had
robbed
them
of
the
fruits
of
their
labour
and
were
childishly
grateful
to
them
for
leaving
anything
at
all
no
wonder
the
rich
despised
them
and
looked
upon
them
as
dirt
they
were
despicable
they
were
dirt
they
admitted
it
and
gloried
in
it
while
these
thoughts
were
seething
in
owen
'
s
mind
his
fellow
workmen
were
still
patiently
toiling
on
downstairs
most
of
them
had
by
this
time
dismissed
hunter
from
their
thoughts
they
did
not
take
things
so
seriously
as
owen
they
flattered
themselves
that
they
had
more
sense
than
that
it
could
not
be
altered
grin
and
bear
it
after
all
it
was
only
for
life
make
the
best
of
things
and
get
your
own
back
whenever
you
get
a
chance
presently
harlow
began
to
sing
he
had
a
good
voice
and
it
was
a
good
song
but
his
mates
just
then
did
not
appreciate
either
one
of
the
other
his
singing
was
the
signal
for
an
outburst
of
exclamations
and
catcalls
`
shut
it
for
christ
'
s
sake

that
'

enough
of

bloody

so
on

stopped

how

in

to

at

linden
did
not

the
large
drops

splashed
heavily
upon
the
ground
he
saw
only
hunter

was
standing
at
the
gate
watching
him
for
a
few
seconds
the
two

at

silence

was
paralysed
with
fear
recovering
himself
he
hastily
removed
his

up

you
jack
made
no
attempt
to
defend
himself
he
knew
it
was
of
no
use
he
silently
put
aside
the
things
he
had
been
using
went
into
the
room
where
he
had
left
his
tool
-
bag
and
coat
removed
his
apron
and
white
jacket
folded
them
up
and
put
them
into
his
tool
-
bag
along
with
the
tools
he
had
been
using
a
chisel
-
knife
and
a
shavehook
put
on
his
coat
and
with
the
tool
-
bag
slung
over
his
shoulder
went
away
from
the
house
without
speaking
to
anyone
else
hunter
then
hastily
walked
over
the
place
noting
what
progress
had
been
made
by
each
man
during
his
absence
he
then
rode
away
as
he
wanted
to
get
to
the
office
in
time
to
give
linden
his
money
it
was
now
very
cold
and
dark
within
the
house
and
as
the
gas
was
not
yet
laid
on
crass
distributed
a
number
of
candles
to
the
men
who
worked
silently
each
occupied
with
his
own
gloomy
thoughts
who
would
be
the
next
outside
sombre
masses
of
lead
-
coloured
clouds
gathered
ominously
in
the
tempestuous
sky
the
gale
roared
loudly
round
the
old
-
fashioned
house
and
the
windows
rattled
discordantly
rain
fell
in
torrents
they
said
it
meant
getting
wet
through
going
home
but
all
the
same
thank
god
it
was
nearly
five
o
'
clock
that
night
as
easton
walked
home
through
the
rain
he
felt
very
depressed
it
had
been
a
very
bad
summer
for
most
people
and
he
had
not
fared
better
than
the
rest
a
few
weeks
with
one
firm
a
few
days
with
another
then
out
of
a
job
then
on
again
for
a
month
perhaps
and
so
on
william
easton
was
a
man
of
medium
height
about
twenty
-
three
years
old
with
fair
hair
and
moustache
and
blue
eyes
he
wore
a
stand
-
up
collar
with
a
coloured
tie
and
his
clothes
though
shabby
were
clean
and
neat
he
was
married
his
wife
was
a
young
woman
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
when
he
happened
to
be
employed
with
others
painting
the
outside
of
the
house
where
she
was
a
general
servant
they
had
`
walked
out
'
for
about
fifteen
months
easton
had
been
in
no
hurry
to
marry
for
he
knew
that
taking
good
times
with
bad
his
wages
did
no
average
a
pound
a
week
at
the
end
of
that
time
however
he
found
that
he
could
not
honourably
delay
longer
so
they
were
married
that
was
twelve
months
ago
as
a
single
man
he
had
never
troubled
much
if
he
happened
to
be
out
of
work
he
always
had
enough
to
live
on
and
pocket
money
besides
but
now
that
he
was
married
it
was
different
the
fear
of
being
`
out
'
haunted
him
all
the
time
he
had
started
for
rushton
&
co
on
the
previous
monday
after
having
been
idle
for
three
weeks
and
as
the
house
where
he
was
working
had
to
be
done
right
through
he
had
congratulated
himself
on
having
secured
a
job
that
would
last
till
christmas
but
he
now
began
to
fear
that
what
had
befallen
jack
linden
might
also
happen
to
himself
at
any
time
he
would
have
to
be
very
careful
not
to
offend
crass
in
any
way
he
was
afraid
the
latter
did
not
like
him
very
much
as
it
was
easton
knew
that
crass
could
get
him
the
sack
at
any
time
and
would
not
scruple
to
do
so
if
he
wanted
to
make
room
for
some
crony
of
his
own
crass
was
the
`
coddy
'
or
foreman
of
the
job
considered
as
a
workman
he
had
no
very
unusual
abilities
he
was
if
anything
inferior
to
the
majority
of
his
fellow
workmen
but
although
he
had
but
little
real
ability
he
pretended
to
know
everything
and
the
vague
references
he
was
in
the
habit
of
making
to
`
tones
'
and
`
shades
'
and
`
harmony
'
had
so
impressed
hunter
that
the
latter
had
a
high
opinion
of
him
as
a
workman
it
was
by
pushing
himself
forward
in
this
way
and
by
judicious
toadying
to
hunter
that
crass
managed
to
get
himself
put
in
charge
of
work
although
crass
did
as
little
work
as
possible
himself
he
took
care
that
the
others
worked
hard
any
man
who
failed
to
satisfy
him
in
this
respect
he
reported
to
hunter
as
being
`
no
good
'
or
`
too
slow
for
a
funeral
'
the
result
was
that
this
man
was
dispensed
with
at
the
end
of
the
week
the
men
knew
this
and
most
of
them
feared
the
wily
crass
accordingly
though
there
were
a
few
whose
known
abilities
placed
them
to
a
certain
extent
above
the
reach
of
his
malice
frank
owen
was
one
of
these
there
were
others
who
by
the
judicious
administration
of
pipefuls
of
tobacco
and
pints
of
beer
managed
to
keep
in
crass
'
s
good
graces
and
often
retained
their
employment
when
better
workmen
were
`
stood
off
'
as
he
walked
home
through
the
rain
thinking
of
these
things
easton
realized
that
it
was
not
possible
to
foresee
what
a
day
or
even
an
hour
might
bring
forth
by
this
time
he
had
arrived
at
his
home
it
was
a
small
house
one
of
a
long
row
of
similar
ones
and
it
contained
altogether
four
rooms
the
front
door
opened
into
a
passage
about
two
feet
six
inches
wide
and
ten
feet
in
length
covered
with
oilcloth
at
the
end
of
the
passage
was
a
flight
of
stairs
leading
to
the
upper
part
of
the
house
the
first
door
on
the
left
led
into
the
front
sitting
-
room
an
apartment
about
nine
feet
square
with
a
bay
window
this
room
was
very
rarely
used
and
was
always
very
tidy
and
clean
the
mantelpiece
was
of
wood
painted
black
and
ornamented
with
jagged
streaks
of
red
and
yellow
which
were
supposed
to
give
it
the
appearance
of
marble
on
the
walls
was
a
paper
with
a
pale
terra
-
cotta
ground
and
a
pattern
consisting
of
large
white
roses
with
chocolate
coloured
leaves
and
stalks
there
was
a
small
iron
fender
with
fire
-
irons
to
match
and
on
the
mantelshelf
stood
a
clock
in
a
polished
wood
case
a
pair
of
blue
glass
vases
and
some
photographs
in
frames
the
floor
was
covered
with
oilcloth
of
a
tile
pattern
in
yellow
and
red
on
the
walls
were
two
or
three
framed
coloured
prints
such
as
are
presented
with
christmas
numbers
of
illustrated
papers
there
was
also
a
photograph
of
a
group
of
sunday
school
girls
with
their
teachers
with
the
church
for
the
background
in
the
centre
of
the
room
was
a
round
deal
table
about
three
feet
six
inches
across
with
the
legs
stained
red
to
look
like
mahogany
against
one
wall
was
an
old
couch
covered
with
faded
cretonne
four
chairs
to
match
standing
backs
to
wall
in
different
parts
of
the
room
the
table
was
covered
with
a
red
cloth
with
a
yellow
crewel
work
design
in
the
centre
and
in
each
of
the
four
corners
the
edges
being
overcast
in
the
same
material
on
the
table
were
a
lamp
and
a
number
of
brightly
bound
books
some
of
these
things
as
the
couch
and
the
chairs
easton
had
bought
second

hand
and
had
done
up
himself
the
table
oilcloth
fender

obtained
on

were
not

paid
for
the
windows
were
draped
with
white
lace
curtains
and
in
the
bay
was
a
small
bamboo
table
on
which
reposed
a
large
holy
bible
cheaply
but
showily
bound
if
anyone
had
ever
opened
this
book
they
would
have
found
that
its
pages
were
as
clean
as
the
other
things
in
the
room
and
on
the
flyleaf
might
have
been
read
the
following
inscription
`
to
dear
ruth
from
her
loving
friend
mrs
starvem
with
the
prayer
that
god
'

word
may
be
her
guide
and
that
jesus
may
be
her
very
own
saviour

mrs
starvem
was
ruth
'
s
former
mistress
and
this
had
been
her
parting
gift
when
ruth
left
to
get
married
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
keepsake
but
as
ruth
never
opened
the
book
and
never
willingly
allowed
her
thoughts
to
dwell
upon
the
scenes
of
which
it
reminded
her
she
had
forgotten
the
existence
of
mrs
starvem
almost
as
completely
as
that
well
-
to
-
do
and
pious
lady
had
forgotten
hers
for
ruth
the
memory
of
the
time
she
spent
in
the
house
of
`
her
loving
friend
'
was
the
reverse
of
pleasant
it
comprised
a
series
of
recollections
of
petty
tyrannies
insults
and
indignities
six
years
of
cruelly
excessive
work
beginning
every
morning
two
or
three
hours
before
the
rest
of
the
household
were
awake
and
ceasing
only
when
she
went
exhausted
to
bed
late
at
night
she
had
been
what
is
called
a
`
slavey
'
but
if
she
had
been
really
a
slave
her
owner
would
have
had
some
regard
for
her
health
and
welfare
her
`
loving
friend
'
had
had
none
mrs
starvem
'
s
only
thought
had
been
to
get
out
of
ruth
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
labour
and
to
give
her
as
little
as
possible
in
return
when
ruth
looked
back
upon
that
dreadful
time
she
saw
it
as
one
might
say
surrounded
by
a
halo
of
religion
she
never
passed
by
a
chapel
or
heard
the
name
of
god
or
the
singing
of
a
hymn
without
thinking
of
her
former
mistress
to
have
looked
into
this
bible
would
have
reminded
her
of
mrs
starvem
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
book
reposed
unopened
and
unread
a
mere
ornament
on
the
table
in
the
bay
window

upstairs
were
two
bedrooms
as
easton
entered
the
house
his
wife
met
him
in
the
passage
and
asked
him
not
to
make
a
noise
as
the
child
had
just
gone
to
sleep
they
kissed
each
other
and
she
helped
him
to
remove
his
wet
overcoat
then
they
both
went
softly
into
the
kitchen
this
room
was
about
the
same
size
as
the
sitting
-
room
at
one
end
was
a
small
range
with
an
oven
and
a
boiler
and
a
high
mantelpiece
painted

some
brightly
polished
tin
canisters

the
other
end
of
the
room
facing
the
fireplace
was
a
small
dresser
on
the
shelves
of
which
were
nearly
arranged
a
number
of
plates
and
dishes
the
walls
were
papered
with
oak
paper
on
one
wall
between
two
coloured
almanacks

oblong
deal
table

the

things
were
set
ready
there
were

chairs
two

table
overhead
across
the
room
about
eighteen
inches
down
from
the

were
stretched
several
cords
upon
which

of

was
sleeping
nearby
stood
a
chair
with
a
towel
hung
on
the
back
arranged
so
as
to
shade
the
infant
'
s
face
from
the
light
of
the
lamp
an
air
of
homely
comfort
pervaded
the
room
the
atmosphere
was
warm
and
the
fire
blazed
cheerfully
over
the
whitened
hearth
they
walked
softly
over
and
stood
by
the
cradle
side
looking
at
the
child
as
they
looked
the
baby
kept
moving
uneasily
in
its
sleep
its
face
was
very
flushed
and
its
eyes
were
moving
under
the
half
-
closed
lids
every
now
and
again
its
lips
were
drawn
back
slightly
showing
part
of
the
gums
presently
it
began
to
whimper
drawing
up
its
knees
as
if
in
pain
`
he
seems
to
have
something
wrong
with
him
said
easton
`
i
think
it
is
his
teeth
replied
the
mother
`
he
is
been
very
restless
all
day
and
he
was
awake
nearly
all
last
night
`
p
'
r
'
aps
he
is
hungry
`
no
it
ca
not
be
that
he
had
the
best
part
of
an
egg
this
morning
and
i
'
ve
nursed
him
several
times
today
and
then
at
dinner
-
time
he
had
a
whole
saucer
full
of
fried
potatoes
with
little
bits
of
bacon
in
it
again
the
infant
whimpered
and
twisted
in
its
sleep
its
lips
drawn
back
showing
the
gums
its
knees
pressed
closely
to
its
body
the
little
fists
clenched
and
face
flushed
then
after
a
few
seconds
it
became
placid
the
mouth
resumed
its
usual
shape
the
limbs
relaxed
and
the
child
slumbered
peacefully
`
do
not
you
think
he
is
getting
thin
asked
easton
`
it
may
be
fancy
but
he
do
not
seem
to
me
to
be
as
big
now
as
he
was
three
months
ago
`
no
he
is
not
quite
so
fat
admitted
ruth
`
it
is
his
teeth
what
'
s
wearing
him
out
he
do
not
hardly
get
no
rest
at
all
with
them
they
continued
looking
at
him
a
little
longer
ruth
thought
he
was
a
very
beautiful
child
he
would
be
eight
months
old
on
sunday
they
were
sorry
they
could
do
nothing
to
ease
his
pain
but
consoled
themselves
with
the
reflection
that
he
would
be
all
right
once
those
teeth
were
through
`
well
let
'
s
have
some
tea
said
easton
at
last
whilst
he
removed
his
wet
boots
and
socks
and
placed
them
in
front
of
the
fire
to
dry
and
put
on
dry
socks
and
a
pair
of
slippers
in
their
stead
ruth
half
filled
a
tin
basin
with
hot
water
from
the
boiler
and
gave
it
to
him
and
he
then
went
to
the
scullery
added
some
cold
water
and
began
to
wash
the
paint
off
his
hands
this
done
he
returned
to
the
kitchen
and
sat
down
at
the
table
`
i
could
not
think
what
to
give
you
to
eat
tonight
said
ruth
as
she
poured
out
the
tea
`
i
had
not
got
no
money
left
and
there
was
not
nothing
in
the
house
except
bread
and
butter
and
that
piece
of
cheese
so
i
cut
some
bread
and
butter
and
put
some
thin
slices
of
cheese
on
it
and
toasted
it
on
a
place
in
front
of
the
fire
i
hope
you
will
like
it
it
was
the
best
i
could
do
`
that
'
s
all
right
it
smells
very
nice
anyway
and
i
am
very
hungry
as
they
were
taking
their
tea
easton
told
his
wife
about
linden
'
s
affair
and
his
apprehensions
as
to
what
might
befall
himself
they
were
both
very
indignant
and
sorry
for
poor
old
linden
but
their
sympathy
for
him
was
soon
forgotten
in
their
fears
for
their
own
immediate
future
they
remained
at
the
table
in
silence
for
some
time
then
`
how
much
rent
do
we
owe
now
asked
easton
`
four
weeks
and
i
promised
the
collector
the
last
time
he
called
that
we
'
d
pay
two
weeks
next
monday
he
was
quite
nasty
about
it
`
well
i
suppose
you
will
have
to
pay
it
that
'
s
all
said
easton
`
how
much
money
will
you
have
tomorrow
asked
ruth
he
began
to
reckon
up
his
time
he
started
on
monday
and
today
was
friday
five
days
from
seven
to
five
less
half
an
hour
for
breakfast
and
an
hour
for
dinner
eight
and
a
half
hours
a
day
-
forty
-
two
hours
and
a
half
at
sevenpence
an
hour
that
came
to
one
pound
four
and
ninepence
halfpenny
`
you
know
i
only
started
on
monday
he
said
`
so
there
'
s
no
back
day
to
come
tomorrow
goes
into
next
week
`
yes
i
know
replied
ruth
`
if
we
pay
the
two
week
'
s
rent
that
will
leave
us
twelve
shillings
to
live
on
`
but
we
wo
not
be
able
to
keep
all
of
that
said
ruth
`
because
there
'
s
other
things
to
pay
`
what
other
things
`
we
owe
the
baker
eight
shillings
for
the
bread
he
let
us
have
while
you
were
not
working
and
there
'
s
about
twelve
shillings
owing
for
groceries
we
will
have
to
pay
them
something
on
account
then
we
want
some
more
coal
there
'
s
only
about
a
shovelful
left
and
-
'
`
wait
a
minnit
said
easton
`
the
best
way
is
to
write
out
a
list
of
everything
we
owe
then
we
shall
know
exactly
where
we
are
you
get
me
a
piece
of
paper
and
tell
me
what
to
write
then
we
will
see
what
it
all
comes
to
`
do
you
mean
everything
we
owe
or
everything
we
must
pay
tomorrow
`
i
think
we
'
d
better
make
a
list
of
all
we
owe
first
while
they
were
talking
the
baby
was
sleeping
restlessly
occasionally
uttering
plaintive
little
cries
the
mother
now
went
and
knelt
at
the
side
of
the
cradle
which
she
gently
rocked
with
one
hand
patting
the
infant
with
the
other
`
except
the
furniture
people
the
biggest
thing
we
owe
is
the
rent
she
said
when
easton
was
ready
to
begin
`
it
seems
to
me
said
he
as
after
having
cleared
a
space
on
the
table
and
arranged
the
paper
he
began
to
sharpen
his
pencil
with
a
table
-
knife
`
that
you
do
not
manage
things
as
well
as
you
might
if
you
was

make
a

just
the
things
you
must
have
before
you
went
out
of
a
saturday
you
'

find
the
money
would
go
much
farther
instead
of
doing
that
you
just
take
the
money
in
your
hand
without
knowing
exactly
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
it

when
you
come
back
it
is
all
gone

next
to
nothing

for
it
his

made
no

her

was
bent
over
the

went

her

of

the

did

up
in

twelve

did
not
you
tell
me
only
the

that
you

paid
up
all

we

thirty

five

i

paid
the

you
were
out
three

up
till
last
friday
and
as
we
had
nothing
in

i
had
to
get
what
we
wanted
without
paying
for
it
`
but
do
you
mean
to
say
it
cost
us
three
shillings
a
week
for
tea
and
sugar
and
butter
`
it
is
not
only

been
bacon

other
things
the

was
beginning
to
become
impatient
`
well
he
said
`
what
else
`
we
owe
the
baker
eight
shillings
we
did
owe
nearly
a
pound
but
i
'

been
paying
it
off
a
little
at
a
time
this
was
added
to
the
list
`
then
there
'

the

'

up

let
us
have
this
amount
by
return
of

under
the
terms
of
your

you
guaranteed
that
the
money
should
be
paid
on
the
saturday
of
every

to
prevent
unpleasantness
we

the
full

punctually

he
read
these
communications
several
times
in
silence
and
finally
with
an
oath
threw
them
down
on
the
table
`
how
much
do
we
still
owe
for
the
oilcloth
and
the
furniture
he
asked
`
i
do
not
know
exactly
it
was
seven
pound
odd
and
we
'
ve
had
the
things
about
six
months
we
paid
one
pound
down
and
three

four
instalments
i
will
get
the
card
if
you
like
`
no
never
mind
say
we
'

paid
one
pound
twelve
so
we
still
owe
about
six
pound
he
added
this
amount
to
the
list
`
i
think
it
is
a
great
pity
we
ever
had
the
things
at
all

said
peevishly
`
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
gone
without
until
we
could
pay
cash
for
them
but
you
would
have
your
way
of
course
now
we
will
have
this
bloody
debt
dragging
on
us
for
years

before
the

stuff
is
paid
for
it
will
be
worn
out

woman
did
not
reply
at
once
she
was
bending
down
over
the
cradle
arranging
the
coverings
which
the
restless
movements
of
the
child
had
disordered
she
was
crying
silently
unnoticed
by
her
husband
for
months
past

in
fact
ever
since
the
child
was
born
-
she
had
been
existing
without
sufficient
food
if
easton
was
unemployed
they
had
to
stint
themselves
so
as
to
avoid
getting
further
into

was
absolutely
necessary
when
he
was
working
they
had
to
go
short
in
order
to
pay
what
they
owed
but
of
what
there
was
easton
himself
without
knowing
it
always
had
the
greater
share
if
he
was
at
work
she
would
pack
into
his
dinner
basket
overnight
the
best
there
was
in
the
house
when
he
was
out
of
work
she
often
pretended
as
she
gave
him
his
meals
that
she
had
had
hers
while
he
was
out
and
all
the
time
the
baby
was
draining
her
life
away
and
her
work
was
never
done
she
felt
very
weak
and
weary
as
she
crouched
there
crying
furtively
and
trying
not
to
let
him
see
at
last
she
said
without
looking
round
`
you
know
quite
well
that
you
were
just
as
much
in
favour
of
getting
them
as
i
was
if
we
had
not
got
the
oilcloth
there
would
have
been
illness
in
the
house
because
of
the
way
the
wind
used
to
come
up
between
the
floorboards
even
now
of
a
windy
day
the
oilcloth
moves
up
and
down
`
well
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
said
easton
as
he
looked
alternatively
at
the
list
of
debts
and
the
three
letters
`
i
give
you
nearly
every
farthing
i
earn
and
i
never
interfere
about
anything
because
i
think
it
is
your
part
to
attend
to
the
house
but
it
seems
to
me
you
do
not
manage
things
properly
the
woman
suddenly
burst
into
a
passion
of
weeping
laying
her
head
on
the
seat
of
the
chair
that
was
standing
near
the
cradle
easton
started
up
in
surprise
`
why
what
'
s
the
matter
he
said
then
as
he
looked
down
upon
the
quivering
form
of
the
sobbing
woman
he
was
ashamed
he
knelt
down
by
her
embracing
her
and
apologizing
protesting
that
he
had
not
meant
to
hurt
her
like
that
`
i
always
do
the
best
i
can
with
the
money
ruth
sobbed
`
i
never
spend
a
farthing
on
myself
but
you
do
not
seem
to
understand
how
hard
it
is
i
do
not
care
nothing
about
having
to
go
without
things
myself
but
i
ca
not
bear
it
when
you
speak
to
me
like
you
do
lately
you
seem
to
blame
me
for
everything
you
use
not
to
speak
to
me
like
that
before
i
before
oh
i
am
so
tired
i
am
so
tired
i
wish
i
could
lie
down
somewhere
and
sleep
and
never

up
any
more
she
turned
away
from
him
half
kneeling
half
sitting
on
the
floor
her
arms
folded
on
the
seat
of
the
chair
and
her
head
resting
upon
them
she
was
crying
in
a
heartbroken
helpless
way
`
i
am
sorry
i
spoke
to
you
like
that
said
easton
awkwardly
`
i
did
not
mean
what
i
said

all

much
to
you

more
than

she
suffered
him
to
draw
her
to
him
laying
her
head
on
his
shoulder
as
he
kissed
and
fondled
her
protesting
that
he
would
rather
be
poor
and
hungry
with
her
than
share
riches
with
anyone
else
the
child
in
the
cradle
-
who
had
been
twisting
and
turning
restlessly
all
this
time
-
now
began
to
cry
loudly
the
mother
took
it
from
the
cradle
and
began
to
hush
and
soothe
it
walking
about
the
room
and
rocking
it
in
her
arms
the
child
however
continued
to
scream
so
she
sat
down
to
nurse
it
for
a
little
while
the
infant
refused
to
drink
struggling
and
kicking
in
its
mother
'
s
arms
then
for
a
few
minutes
it
was
quite
taking
the
milk
in
a
half
-
hearted
fretful
way
then
it
began
to
scream
and
twist
and
struggle
they
both
looked
at
it
in
a
helpless
manner
whatever
could
be
the
matter
with
it
it
must
be
those
teeth
then
suddenly
as
they
were
soothing
and
patting
him
the
child
vomited
all
over
its
own
and
its
mother
'
s
clothing
a
mass
of
undigested
food
mingled
with
the
curdled
milk
were
fragments
of
egg
little
bits
of
bacon
bread
and
particles
of
potato
having
rid
his
stomach
of
this
unnatural
burden
the
unfortunate
baby
began
to
cry
afresh
his
face
very
pale
his
lips
colourless
and
his
eyes
red
-
rimmed
and
running
with
water
easton
walked
about
with
him
while
ruth
cleaned
up
the
mess
and
got
ready
some
fresh
clothing
they
both
agreed
that
it
was
the
coming
teeth
that
had
upset
the
poor
child
'
s
digestion
it
would
be
a
good
job
when
they
were
through
this
work
finished
easton
who
was
still
convinced
in
his
own
mind
that
with
the
aid
of
a
little
common
sense
and
judicious
management
their
affairs
might
be
arranged
more
satisfactorily
said
`
we
may
as
well
make
a
list
of
all
the
things
we
must
pay

buy
tomorrow
the
great
thing
is
to
think
out
exactly
what
you
are
going
to
do
before
you
spend
anything
that
saves
you
from

my

they

you

easton
irritably
`
we

not

less
than
three
shillings
for
groceries
easton
looked
carefully
at
his
list
this
time
he
felt
sure
that
the
item
was
already
down
but
finding
he
was
mistaken
he
said
nothing
and
added
the
amount
`
well
i
'
ve
got
that
what
else
`
milk
one
and
two
`
next
`
vegetables
eightpence
`
yes
`
paraffin
oil
and
firewood
sixpence
again
the
financier
scrutinized
the
list
he
was
positive
that
it
was
down
already
however
he
could
not
find
it
so
the
sixpence
was
added
to
the
column
of
figures
`
then
there
'
s
your
boots
you
ca
not
go
about
with
them
old
things
in
this
weather
much
longer
and
they
wo
not
stand
mending
again
you
remember
the
old
man
said
they
were
not
worth
it
when
you
had
that
patch
put
on
a
few
weeks
ago
`
yes
i
was
thinking
of
buying
a
new
pair
tomorrow
my
socks
was
wet
through
tonight
if
it
is
raining
some
morning
when
i
am
going
out
and
i
have
to
work
all

with
wet

be
laid
up
`
at
that
second
-
hand
shop
down
in
high
street
i
saw
when
i
was
out
this
afternoon
a
very
good
pair
just
your
size
for
two
shillings
easton
did
not
reply
at
once
he
did
not
much
fancy
wearing
the
cast
-
off
boots
of
some
stranger
who
for
all
he
knew
might
have
suffered
from
some
disease
but
then
remembering
that
his
old
ones
were
literally
falling
off
his
feet
he
realized
that
he
had
practically
no
choice
`
if
you
are
quite
sure
they
will
fit
you
'
d
better
get
them
it
is
better
to
do
that
than
for
me
to
catch
cold
and
be
laid
up
for
god
knows
how
long
so
the
two
shillings
were
added
to
the
list
`
is
there
anything
else
`
how
much
does
it
all
come
to
now
asked
ruth
easton
added
it
all
up
when
he
had
finished
he
remained
staring
at
the
figures
in
consternation
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
`
jesus
christ
he
ejaculated
at
last
`
what
'

it
come
to
asked
ruth
`
forty
-
four
and
tenpence
`
i
knew
we
would
not
have
enough
said
ruth
wearily
`
now
if
you
think
i
manage
so
badly
p
'
raps
you
can
tell
me
which
of
these
things
we
ought
to
leave
out
`
we
'
d
be
all
right
if
it
was
not
for
the
debts
said
easton
doggedly
`
when
you
are
not
working
we
must
either
get
into
debt
or
starve
easton
made
no
answer
`
what
will
we
do
about
the
rates
asked
ruth
`
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
there
'

nothing
left
to
pawn
except
my
black
coat
and
vest
you
might
get
something
on
that
`
it
will
have
to
be
paid
somehow
said
ruth
`
or
you
will
be
taken
off
to
jail
for
a
month
the
same
as
mrs
newman
'
s
husband
was
last
winter
`
well
you
'

better
take
the
coat
and
vest
and
see
what
you
can
get
on
'

tomorrow
`
yes
said
ruth
`
and
there
'
s
that
brown
silk
dress
of
mine
-
you
know
the
one
i
wore
when
we
was
married
i
might
get
something
on
that
because
we
wo
not
get
enough
on
the
coat
and
vest
i
do
not
like
parting
with
the
dress
although
i
never
wear
it
but
we
will
be
sure
to
be
able
to
get
it
out
again
wo
not
we
`
of
course
said
easton
they
remained
silent
for
some
time
easton
staring
at
the
list
of
debts
and
the
letters
she
was
wondering
if
he
still
thought
she
managed
badly
and
what
he
would
do
about
it
she
knew
she
had
always
done
her
best
at
last
she
said
wistfully
trying
to
speak
plainly
for
there
seemed
to
be
a
lump
in
her
throat
`
and
what
about
tomorrow
would
you
like
to
spend
the
money
yourself
or
shall
i
manage
as
i
'
ve
done
before
or
will
you
tell
me
what
to
do
`
i
do
not
know
dear
said
easton
sheepishly
`
i
think
you
'

better
do
as
you
think
best
`
oh
i
will
manage
all
right
dear
you
will
see
replied
ruth
who
seemed
to
think
it
a
sort
of
honour
to
be
allowed
to
starve
herself
and
wear
shabby
clothes
the
baby
who
had
been
for
some
time
quietly
sitting
upon
his
mother
'
s
lap
looking
wonderingly
at
the
fire
-
his
teeth
appeared
to
trouble
him
less
since
he
got
rid
of
the
eggs
and
bacon
and
potatoes
-
now
began
to
nod
and
doze
which
easton
perceiving
suggested
that
the
infant
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
to
sleep
with
an
empty
stomach
because
it
would
probably
wake
up
hungry
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
therefore
work
him
up
as
much
as
possible
and
mashed
a
little
of
the
bread
and
toasted
cheese
with
a
little
warm
milk
then
taking
the
baby
from
ruth
he
began
to
try
to
induce
it
to
eat
as
soon
however
as
the
child
understood
his
object
it
began
to
scream
at
the
top
of
its
voice
closing
its
lips
firmly
and
turning
its
head
rapidly
from
side
to
side
every
time
the
spoon
approached
its
mouth
it
made
such
a
dreadful
noise
that
easton
at
last
gave
in
he
began
to
walk
about
the
room
with
it
and
presently
the
child
sobbed
itself
to
sleep
after
putting
the
baby
into
its
cradle
ruth
set
about
preparing
easton
'
s
breakfast
and
packing
it
into
his
basket
this
did
not
take
very
long
there
being
only
bread
and
butter
or
to
be
more
correct
margarine
then
she
poured
what
tea
was
left
in
the
tea
-
pot
into
a
small
saucepan
and
placed
it
on
the
top
of
the
oven
but
away
from
the
fire
cut
two
more
slices
of
bread
and
spread
on
them
all
the
margarine
that
was
left
then
put
them
on
a
plate
on
the
table
covering
them
with
a
saucer
to
prevent
them
getting
hard
and
dry
during
the
night
near
the
plate
she
placed
a
clean
cup
and
saucer
and
the
milk
and
sugar
in
the
morning
easton
would
light
the
fire
and
warm
up
the
tea
in
the
saucepan
so
as
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
before
going
out
if
ruth
was
awake
and
he
was
not
pressed
for
time
he
generally
took
a
cup
of
tea
to
her
in
bed
nothing
now
remained
to
be
done
but
to
put
some
coal
and
wood
ready
in
the
fender
so
that
there
would
be
no
unnecessary
delay
in
the
morning
the
baby
was
still
sleeping
and
ruth
did
not
like
to
wake
him
up
yet
to
dress
him
for
the
night
easton
was
sitting
by
the
fire
smoking
so
everything
being
done
ruth
sat
down
at
the
table
and
began
sewing
presently
she
spoke
`
i
wish
you
'
d
let
me
try
to
let
that
back
room
upstairs
the
woman
next
door
has
got
hers
let
unfurnished
to
an
elderly
woman
and
her
husband
for
two
shillings
a
week
if
we
could
get
someone
like
that
it
would
be
better
than
having
an
empty
room
in
the
house
`
and
we
'
d
always
have
them
messing
about
down
here
cooking
and
washing
and
one
thing
and
another
objected
easton
`
they
'
d
be
more
trouble
than
they
way
worth
`
well
we
might
try
and
furnish
it
there
'
s
mrs
crass
across
the
road
has
got
two
lodgers
in
one
room
they
pay
her
twelve
shillings
a
week
each
board
lodging
and
washing
that
'
s
one
pound
four
she
has
coming
in
reglar
every
week
if
we
could
do
the
same
we
'
d
very
soon
be
out
of
debt
`
what
'
s
the
good
of
talking
you
'
d
never
be
able
to
do
the
work
even
if
we
had
the
furniture
`
oh
the
work
'
s
nothing
replied
ruth
`
and
as
for
the
furniture
we
'
ve
got
plenty
of
spare
bedclothes
and
we
could
easily
manage
without
a
washstand
in
our
room
for
a
bit
so
the
only
thing
we
really
want
is
a
small
bedstead
and
mattress
we
could
get
them
very
cheap
second
-
hand
`
there
ought
to
be
a
chest
of
drawers
said
easton
doubtfully
`
i
do
not
think
so
replied
ruth
`
there
'
s
a
cupboard
in
the
room
and
whoever
took
it
would
be
sure
to
have
a
box
`
well
if
you
think
you
can
do
the
work
i
'
ve
no
objection
said
easton
`
it
will
be
a
nuisance
having
a
stranger
in
the
way
all
the
time
but
i
suppose
we
must
do
something
of
the
sort
or
else
we
will
have
to
give
up
the
house
and
take
a
couple
of
rooms
somewhere
that
would
be
worse
than
having
lodgers
ourselves
`
let
'
s
go
and
have
a
look
at
the
room
he
added
getting
up
and
taking
the
lamp
from
the
wall
they
had
to
go
up
two
flights
of
stairs
before
arriving
at
the
top
landing
where
there
were
two
doors
one
leading
into
the
front
room
their
bedroom
and
the
other
into
the
empty
back
room
these
two
doors
were
at
right
angles
to
each
other
the
wallpaper
in
the
back
room
was
damaged
and
soiled
in
several
places
`
there
'
s
nearly
a
whole
roll
of
this
paper
on
the
top
of
the
cupboard
said
ruth
`
you
could
easily
mend
all
those
places
we
could
hag
up
a
few
almanacks
on
the
walls
our
washstand
could
go
there
by
the
window
a
chair
just
there
and
the
bed
along
that
wall
behind
the
door
it
is
only
a
small
window
so
i
could
easily
manage
to
make
a
curtain
out
of
something
i
am
sure
i
could
make
the
room
look
quite
nice
without
spending
hardly
anything
easton
reached
down
the
roll
of
paper
it
was
the
same
pattern
as
that
on
the
wall
the
latter
was
a
good
deal
faded
of
course
but
it
would
not
matter
much
if
the
patches
showed
a
little
they
returned
to
the
kitchen
`
do
you
think
you
know
anyone
who
would
take
it
asked
ruth
easton
smoked
thoughtfully
`
no
he
said
at
length
`
but
i
will
mention
it
to
one
or
two
of
the
chaps
on
the
job
they
might
know
of
someone
`
and
i
will
get
mrs
crass
to
ask
her
lodgers
p
'
raps
they
might
have
a
friend
what
would
like
to
live
near
them
so
it
was
settled
and
as
the
fire
was
nearly
out
and
it
was
getting
late
they
prepared
to
retire
for
the
night
the
baby
was
still
sleeping
so
easton
lifted
it
cradle
and
all
and
carried
it
up
the
narrow
staircase
into
the
front
bedroom
ruth
leading
the
way
carrying
the
lamp
and
some
clothes
for
the
child
so
that
the
infant
might
be
within
easy
reach
of
its
mother
during
the
night
two
chairs
were
arranged
close
to
her
side
of
the
bed
and
the
cradle
placed
on
them
`
now
we
'
ve
forgot
the
clock
said
easton
pausing
he
was
half
undressed
and
had
already
removed
his
slippers
`
i
will
slip
down
and
get
it
said
ruth
`
never
mind
i
will
go
said
easton
beginning
to
put
his
slippers
on
again
`
no
you
get
into
bed
i
'
ve
not
started
undressing
yet
i
will
get
it
replied
ruth
who
was
already
on
her
way
down
`
i
do
not
know
as
it
was
worth
the
trouble
of
going
down
said
ruth
when
she
returned
with
the
clock
`
it
stopped
three
or
four
times
today
`
well
i
hope
it
do
not
stop
in
the
night
easton
said
`
it
would
be
a
bit
of
all
right
not
knowing
what
time
it
was
in
the
morning
i
suppose
the
next
thing
will
be
that
we
will
have
to
buy
a
new
clock
he
woke
several
times
during
the
night
and
struck
a
match
to
see
if
it
was
yet
time
to
get
up
at
half
past
two
the
clock
was
still
going
and
he
again
fell
asleep
the
next
time
he
work
up
the
ticking
had
ceased
he
wondered
what
time
it
was
it
was
still
very
dark
but
that
was
nothing
to
go
by
because
it
was
always
dark
at
six
now
he
was
wide
awake
it
must
be
nearly
time
to
get
up
it
would
never
do
to
be
late
he
might
get
the
sack
he
got
up
and
dressed
himself
ruth
was
asleep
so
he
crept
quietly
downstairs
lit
the
fire
and
heated
the
tea
when
it
was
ready
he
went
softly
upstairs
again
ruth
was
still
sleeping
so
he
decided
not
to
disturb
her
returning
to
the
kitchen
he
poured
out
and
drank
a
cup
of
tea
put
on
his
boots
overcoat
and
hat
and
taking
his
basket
went
out
of
the
house
the
rain
was
still
falling
and
it
was
very
cold
and
dark
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
street
easton
shivered
as
he
walked
along
wondering
what
time
it
could
be
he
remembered
there
was
a
clock
over
the
front
of
a
jeweller
'
s
shop
a
little
way
down
the
main
road
when
he
arrived
at
this
place
he
found
that
the
clock
being
so
high
up
he
could
not
see
the
figures
on
the
face
distinctly
because
it
was
still
very
dark
he
stood
staring
for
a
few
minutes
vainly
trying
to
see
what
time
it
was
when
suddenly
the
light
of
a
bull
'
s
-
eye
lantern
was
flashed
into
his
eyes
`
you
are
about
very
early
said
a
voice
the
owner
of
which
easton
could
not
see
the
light
blinded
him
`
what
time
is
it
said
easton
`
i
'

got
to
get
to

seven

easton
explained
`
well
said
the
constable
`
it
is
very
strange

about
three

what

easton
gave
his
name
and
address
and
began
repeating
the
story
about
the
clock
having
stopped
`
what
you
say
may
be
all
right
or
it
may
not
interrupted
the
policeman
`
i
am
not

that
i
ought
to
take
you

opening
the
basket
and
displaying
its
contents
`
i
am
inclined
to
believe

you

the

after
a
pause

to
make
quite

i
should
advise

buy
a
decent

you
will
be
getting
yourself
into
trouble
when
they
arrived
at
the
house
easton
opened
the
door
and
after
making
some
entries
in
his
note
-
book
the
officer
went
away
much
to
the
relief
of
easton
who
went
upstairs
set
the
hands
of
the
clock
right
and
started
it
going
again
he
then
removed
his
overcoat
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
in
his
clothes
covering
himself
with
the
quilt
after
a
while
he
fell
asleep
and
when
he
awoke
the
clock
was
still

the
time
was
exactly

frank
owen
was
the
son
of
a
journeyman
carpenter
who
had
died
of
consumption
when
the
boy
was
only
five
years
old
after
that
his
mother
earned
a
scanty
living
as
a
needle
-
woman
when
frank
was
thirteen
he
went
to
work
for
a
master
decorator
who
was
a
man
of
a
type
that
has
now
almost
disappeared
being
not
merely
an
employer
but
a
craftsman
of
a
high
order
he
was
an
old
man
when
frank

went
to
work
for
him
at
one
time
he
had
had
a
good
business
in
the
town
and
used
to
boast
that
he
had
always
done
good
work
had
found
pleasure
in
doing
it
and
had
been
well
paid
for
it
but
of
late
years
the
number
of
his
customers
had
dwindled
considerably
for
there
had
arisen
a
new
generation
which
cared
nothing
about
craftsmanship
or
art
and
everything
for
cheapness
and

a
certain

'
s
mother
died
when
he
was
twenty
-
four
and
a
year
afterwards
he
married
the
daughter
of
a
fellow
workman
in
those
days
trade
was
fairly
good
and
although
there
was
not
much
demand
for
the
more
artistic
kinds
of
work
still
the
fact
that
he
was
capable
of
doing
them
if
required
made
it
comparatively
easy
for
him
to
obtain
employment
owen
and
his
wife
were
very
happy
they
had
one
child
a
boy
and
for
some
years
all
went
well
but
gradually
this
state
of
things
altered
broadly
speaking
the
change
came
slowly
and
imperceptibly
although
there
were
occasional
sudden
fluctuations
even
in
summer
he
could
not
always
find
work
and
in
winter
it
was
almost
impossible
to
get
a
job
of
any
sort
at
last
about
twelve
months
before
the
date
that
this
story
opens
he
determined
to
leave
his
wife
and
child
at
home
and
go
to
try
his
fortune
in
london
when
he
got
employment
he
would
send
for
them
it
was
a
vain
hope
he
found
london
if
anything
worse
than
his
native
town
wherever
he
went
he
was
confronted
with
the
legend
`
no
hands
wanted
'
he
walked
the
streets
day
after
day
pawned
or
sold
all
his
clothes
save
those
he
stood
in
and
stayed
in
london
for
six
months
sometimes
starving
and
only
occasionally
obtaining
a
few
days
or
weeks
work
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
was
forced
to
give
in
the
privations
he
had
endured
the
strain
on
his
mind
and
the
foul
atmosphere
of
the
city
combined
to
defeat
him
symptoms
of
the
disease
that
had
killed
his
father
began
to
manifest
themselves
and
yielding
to
the
repeated
entreaties
of
his
wife
he
returned
to
his
native
town
the
shadow
of
his
former
self
that
was
six
months
ago
and
since
then
he
had
worked
for
rushton
&
co
occasionally
when
they
had
no
work
in
hand
he
was
`
stood
off
'
until
something
came
in
ever
since
his
return
from
london
owen
had
been
gradually
abandoning
himself
to
hopelessness
every
day
he
felt
that
the
disease
he
suffered
from
was
obtaining
a
stronger
grip
on
him
the
doctor
told
him
to
`
take
plenty
of
nourishing
food
'
and
prescribed
costly
medicines
which
owen
had
not
the
money
to
buy
then
there
was
his
wife
naturally
delicate
she
needed
many
things
that
he
was
unable
to
procure
for
her
and
the
boy
what
hope
was
there
for
him
often
as
owen
moodily
thought
of
their
circumstances
and
prospects
he
told
himself
that
it
would
be
far
better
if
they
could
all
three
die
now
together
he
was
tired
of
suffering
himself
tired
of
impotently
watching
the
sufferings
of
his
wife
and
appalled
at
the
thought
of
what
was
in
store
for
the
child
of
this
nature
were
his
reflections
as
he
walked
homewards
on
the
evening
of
the
day
when
old
linden
was
dismissed
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
or
hope
that
the
existing
state
of
things
would
be
altered
for
a
long
time
to
come
thousands
of
people
like
himself
dragged
out
a
wretched
existence
on
the
very
verge
of
starvation
and
for
the
greater
number
of
people
life
was
one
long
struggle
against
poverty
yet
practically
none
of
these
people
knew
or
even
troubled
themselves
to
inquire
why
they
were
in
that
condition
and
for
anyone
else
to
try
to
explain
to
them
was
a
ridiculous
waste
of
time
for
they
did
not
want
to
know
the
remedy
was
so
simple
the
evil
so
great
and
so
glaringly
evident
