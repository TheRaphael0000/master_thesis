situated
about
a
mile
outside
the

it
stood
back
nearly
two
hundred
yards
from

was
reached
by

of
a

of
which
was
a

formed
of

this

had
been
unoccupied
for
many
years
and
it
was
now
being
altered

renovated
for
its
new

by
the

were

about
twenty

besides
several
unskilled

being
put
in
where
the
old

were
decayed
and
upstairs
two
of
the

being
made
into

of

of

all
the
old
whitewash
had
to
be
washed
off
the

and
all
the

had
to
be
scraped
off
the
walls
preparatory
to
the
house
being
repainted
and
decorated
the
air
was
full
of
the
sounds
of
hammering
and
sawing
the
ringing
of
trowels
the
rattle
of
pails
the
splashing
of

the
scraping
of
the
stripping

used
by
those
who
were
removing
the
old
wallpaper

years
in
brief
those

there
might
be
said
to

and
all

assembled
in
the
kitchen
where
bert
the
apprentice
had
already
prepared
the
tea
which
was
ready
in
the
large
galvanized
iron

that
he
had
placed
in
the

at

time
as

as

the

generally

laid
parallel
on

at
a

about
eight

of

a
sack

leaning
against
one
of
the

a
bucket
containing
some
stale
whitewash
stood
in
one
corner
as
each
man
came
in
he
filled
his
cup

condensed
milk
tin
with
tea
from
the
steaming
pail
before
sitting
down
most
of

brought
their
food
in
little
wicker
baskets

they
held
on
their
laps
or
placed
on
the
floor
beside
them
at
first
there
was
no
attempt
at
conversation
and
nothing
was
heard
but
the
sounds
of
eating
and
drinking
and
the
drizzling
of
the
bloater
which
easton
one
of
the
painters
was
toasting
on
the
end
of
a
pointed
stick
at
the
fire
`
i
do
not
think
much
of

bloody

remarked
sawkins
one
of
the

it

white
was
a
frail
-
looking
weedy
pale
-
faced
boy
fifteen
years
of
age
and
about
four
feet
nine
inches
in
height
his
trousers
were
part
of
a
suit
that
he
had
once
worn
for
best
but
that
was
so
long
ago
that
they
had
become
too
small
for
him
fitting
rather
lightly
and
scarcely
reaching
the
top
of
his
patched
and
broken
hob
-
nailed
boots
the
knees
and
the
bottoms
of
the
legs
of
his
trousers
had
been
patched
with
square
pieces
of
cloth
several
shades
darker
than
the
original
fabric
and
these
patches
were
now
all
in
rags
his
coat
was
several
sizes
too
large
for
him
and
hung
about
him
like
a
dirty
ragged
sack
he
was
a
pitiable
spectacle
of
neglect
and
wretchedness
as
he
sat
there
on
an
upturned
pail
eating
his
bread
and
cheese
with
fingers
that
like
his
clothing
were
grimed
with
paint
and
dirt
`
well
then
you

why
the

not

the
boy
alone
said
harlow
another
painter
`
if
you
do
not

the

you
need
not

it
for

i
am
sick

you

it

all
very

for
you
to

it
answered
sawkins
`
but
i
'
ve
paid
my
share
an
'
i
'
ve
got
a
right
to
express
an
opinion
it
is
my
belief
that

the
money
we
gives

is
spent
on

so
there
at
this
revelation
some
of
the
men
furtively
exchanged
significant
glances
and
crass
the

became
very
red
`
you

better
keep

said

sawkins
was
not
popular
with
any
of
the
others
when
about
twelve
months
previously
he
first
came
to
work
for
rushton
&
co
he
was
a
simple
labourer
but
since
then
he
had
`
picked
up
'
a
slight
knowledge
of
the
trade
and
having
armed
himself
with
a
putty
-
knife
and
put
on
a
white
jacket
regarded
himself
as
a
fully
qualified
painter
the
others
did
not
perhaps
object
to
him
trying
to
better
his
condition
but
his
wages
-
fivepence
an
hour
-
were
twopence
an
hour
less
than
the
standard
rate
and
the
result
was
that
in
slack
times
often
a
better
workman
was
`
stood
off
'
when
sawkins
was
kept
on
moreover
he
was
generally
regarded
as
a
sneak
who
carried
tales
to
the
foreman
and
the
`
bloke
'
every
new
hand
who
was
taken
on
was
usually
warned
by
his
new
mates
`
not
to
let
the
b
-
r
sawkins
see
anything
the
unpleasant
silence
which
now
ensued
was
at
length
broken
by
one
of
the
men
who
told
a
dirty
story
and
in
the
laughter
and
applause
that
followed
the
incident
of
the
tea
was
forgotten
`
how
did
you
get
on
yesterday
asked
crass
addressing
bundy
the
plasterer
who
was
intently
studying
the
sporting
columns
of
the
daily
obscurer
`
no
luck
replied
bundy
gloomily
`
i
had
a
bob
each
way
on
stockwell
in
the
first
race
but
it
was
scratched
before
the
start
this
gave
rise
to
a
conversation
between
crass
bundy
and
one
or
two
others
concerning
the
chances
of
different
horses
in
the
morrow
'
s
races
it
was
friday
and
no
one
had
much
money
so
at
the
suggestion
of
bundy
a
syndicate
was
formed
each
member
contributing
threepence
for
the
purpose
of
backing
a
dead
certainty
given
by
the
renowned
captain
kiddem
of
the
obscurer
one
of
those
who
did
not
join
the
syndicate
was
frank
owen
who
was
as
usual
absorbed
in
a
newspaper
he
was
generally
regarded
as
a
bit
of
a
crank
for
it
was
felt
that
there
must
be
something
wrong
about
a
man
who
took
no
interest
in
racing
or
football
and
was
always
talking
a
lot
of
rot
about
religion
and
politics
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fact
that
he
was
generally
admitted
to
be
an
exceptionally
good
workman
they
would
have
had
little
hesitation
about
thinking
that
he
was
mad
this
man
was
about
thirty
-
two
years
of
age
and
of
medium
height
but
so
slightly
built
that
he
appeared
taller
there
was
a
suggestion
of
refinement
in
his
clean
-
shaven
face
but
his
complexion
was
ominously
clear
and
an
unnatural
colour
flushed
the
think
cheeks
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
justification
for
the
attitude
of
his
fellow
workmen
for
owen
held
the
most
unusual
and
unorthodox
opinions
on
the
subjects
mentioned
the
affairs
of
the
world
are
ordered
in
accordance
with
orthodox
opinions
if
anyone
did
not
think
in
accordance
with
these
he
soon
discovered
this
fact
for
himself
owen
saw
that
in
the
world
a
small
class
of
people
were
possessed
of
a
great
abundance
and
superfluity
of
the
things
that
are
produced
by
work
he
saw
also
that
a
very
great
number
in
fact
the
majority
of
the
people
lived
on
the
verge
of
want
and
that
a
smaller
but
still
very
large
number
lived
lives
of
semi
-
starvation
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
while
a
yet
smaller
but
still
very
great
number
actually
died
of
hunger
or
maddened
by
privation
killed
themselves
and
their
children
in
order
to
put
a
period
to
their
misery
and
strangest
of
all
-
in
his
opinion
-
he
saw
that
people
who
enjoyed
abundance
of
the
things
that
are
made
by
work
were
the
people
who
did
nothing
and
that
the
others
who
lived
in
want
or
died
of
hunger
were
the
people
who
worked
and
seeing
all
this
he
thought
that
it
was
wrong
that
the
system
that
produced
such
results
was
rotten
and
should
be
altered
and
he
had
sought
out
and
eagerly
read
the
writings
of
those
who
thought
they
knew
how
it
might
be
done
it
was
because
he
was
in
the
habit
of
speaking
of
these
subjects
that
his
fellow
workmen
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
probably
something
wrong
with
his
mind
when
all
the
members
of
the
syndicate
had
handed
over
their
contributions
bundy
went
out
to
arrange
matters
with
the
bookie
and
when
he
had
gone
easton
annexed
the
copy
of
the
obscurer
that
bundy
had
thrown
away
and
proceeded
to
laboriously
work
through
some
carefully
cooked
statistics
relating
to
free
trade
and
protection
bert
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
and
his
mouth
wide
open
was
devouring
the
contents
of
a
paper
called
the
chronicles

a
poor
devil
who
was
paid
fourpence
an
hour
for
acting
as
mate

labourer
to
bundy

the
bricklayers

wanted

down

coat
rolled
up

cup
he
brought
for
his
tea
back
into
his
dinner
basket
took
out
an
old
briar
pipe
which
he
slowly
filled
and
proceeded
to
smoke
in
silence
some
time
previously
the
firm
had
done
some
work
for
a
wealthy
gentleman
who
lived
in
the
country
some
distance
outside
mugsborough
this
gentleman
also
owned
some
property
in
the
town
and
it
was
commonly
reported
that
he
had
used
his
influence
with
rushton
to
induce
the
latter
to
give
barrington
employment
it
was
whispered
amongst
the
hands
that
the
young
man
was
a
distant
relative
of
the
gentleman
'
s
and
that
he
had
disgraced
himself
in
some
way
and
been
disowned
by
his
people
rushton
was
supposed
to
have
given
him
a
job
in
the
hope
of
currying
favour
with
his
wealthy
client
from
whom
he
hoped
to
obtain
more
work
whatever
the
explanation
of
the
mystery
may
have
been
the
fact
remained
that
barrington
who
knew
nothing
of
the
work
except
what
he
had
learned
since
he
had
been
taken
on
was
employed
as
a
painter
'
s
labourer
at
the
usual
wages
fivepence
per
hour
he
was
about
twenty
-
five
years
of
age
and
a
good
deal
taller
than
the
majority
of
the
others
being
about
five
feet
ten
inches
in
height
and
slenderly
though
well
and
strongly
built
he
seemed
very
anxious
to
learn
all
that
he
could
about
the
trade
and
although
rather
reserved
in
his
manner
he
had
contrived
to
make
himself
fairly
popular
with
his
workmates
he
seldom
spoke
unless
to
answer
when
addressed
and
it
was
difficult
to
draw
him
into
conversation
at
meal
-
times
as
on
the
present
occasion
he
generally
smoked
apparently
lost
in
thought
and
unconscious
of
his
surroundings
most
of
the
others
also
lit
their
pipes
and
a
desultory
conversation
ensued

about

for

this
important

old

`
there
'

generally
some

of

the

by
this

joke
had

it

there

going

a

right
out

the

connected
with
the
main
crass
really
knew
no
more
about
what
was
going

in
this

than
did
linden
but
he
felt
certain
that
this
course
would
be
adopted
he
never
missed
an
opportunity
of
enhancing
his
own
prestige
with
the
men
by
insinuating
that
he
was
in
the
confidence
of
the

'

goin

he
was
not
about
to

exactly
what
the
compiler
of
the
figures
was
driving
at
probably
the
latter
never
intended
that
anyone
should
understand
-
but
he
was
conscious
of
a
growing
feeling
of
indignation
and
hatred
against
foreigners
of
every
description
who
were
ruining
this
country
and
he
began
to
think
that
it
was
about
time
we
did
something
to
protect
ourselves
still
it
was
a
very
difficult
question
to
tell
the
truth
he
himself
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
it
at

he
said
aloud

about

generally
ends
up
with
a
bloody
row
an
'
does
no
good
to
nobody
at
this
there
was
a
murmur
of
approval
from
several
of
the
others
most
of
them
were
averse
from
arguing
or
disputing
about
politics
if
two
or
three
men
of
similar
opinions
happened
to
be
together
they
might
discuss
such
things
in
a
friendly
and
superficial
way
but
in
a
mixed
company
it
was
better
left
alone
the
'
fissical
policy
'
emanated
from
the
tory
party
that
was
the
reason
why
some
of
them
were
strongly
in
favour
of
it
and
for
the
same
reason
others
were
opposed
to
it
some
of
them
were
under
the
delusion
that
they
were
conservatives
similarly
others
imagined
themselves
to
be
liberals
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
them
were
nothing
they
knew
as
much
about
the
public
affairs
of
their

they
did

the

easton
began
to
regret
that
he
had
broached
so
objectionable
a
subject
when
looking
up
from
his
paper
owen
said
`
does
the
fact
that

there
ensued

however
in

of
the

he
had
received
could
not
refrain
from
talking

if
what

in

it

to
me

the
disquieting
nature

owen
again
laughed
much
to
the
indignation
of
the
others
who
thought
it
was
a
very
serious
state
of

out

mouths
they
ought
to
be
driven
into

so
the
talk
continued
principally
carried
on
by
crass

those
who
agreed
with
him
none
of

really
understood
the
subject

of
them
had
ever
devoted
fifteen
consecutive
minutes
to
the
earnest
investigation
of
it

papers
they
read
were
filled
with
vague
and
alarming
accounts
of
the
quantities
of
foreign
merchandise
imported
into
this
country
the
enormous
number
of
aliens
constantly
arriving
and
their
destitute
conditions
how
they
lived
the
crimes
they
committed
and
the
injury
they
did
to
british
trade
these
were
the
seeds
which
cunningly
sown
in
their
minds
caused
to
grow
up
within
them
a
bitter
undiscriminating
hatred
of
foreigners
to
them
the
mysterious
thing
they
variously
called
the
`

the

the
conclusion

such
of

the

not

it
was
all
as
clear
as

the
enemy

indignantly
protests

in

he

not
very
old
being
only
a
little
over
fifty

he
looked
much
older
he
had
lost
his

some
five

had
roused
philpot
'

indignation
he
felt
that
it
was
directed
against
himself
the
muddled
condition
of
his
brain
did
not
permit
him
to
take
up
the
cudgels
in
his
own

he
knew
that
although
owen
was
a

totaller
himself
he
disliked
slyme
`
there
'
s
no
need
for
us
to
talk
about

laziness
returned
owen
impatiently
`
because
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
the
question
is
what
is
the
cause
of
the
lifelong
poverty
of
the
majority
of
those
who
are
not
drunkards
and
who
do
work
why
if
all
the
drunkards
and
won

works

unskilled

inefficient
workers
could
be
by
some
miracle
transformed
into
sober
industrious
and
skilled
workers
tomorrow
it
would
under
the
present
conditions
be
so
much
the
worse
for
us
because
there
is
not
enough
work
for
all
now
and
those
people
by
increasing
the
competition
for
what
work
there
is
would
inevitably
cause
a
reduction
of
wages
and
a
greater
scarcity
of
employment
the
theories
that
drunkenness
laziness
or
inefficiency
are
the
causes
of
poverty
are
so
many
devices
invented
and
fostered
by
those
who
are
selfishly
interested
in
maintaining
the
present
states
of

for
the

preventing

discovering
the

apart

a

abstractedly

raised
it
to
his

suddenly
remembering
that

set
it
down
again

at

of

if

no

of

said
crass
impatiently
the

laughed
disdainfully
it
seemed
to
them
such
a
foolish
question
`
well
that
'

true
enough
as
far
as
it
goes
returned
owen
`
that
is
as
things
are
arranged
in

at

but
money
itself
is
not
wealth
it
is
of
no
use
whatever
at
this
there
was
another
outburst
of
jeering
laughter
`
supposing
for
example
that
you
and
harlow
were
shipwrecked
on
a
desolate
island
and
you
had
saved
nothing
from
the

a

containing
a
thousand
sovereigns

a
tin
of

a
bottle

appealingly
`
who

`
what

you

then
asked
easton
`
what

so
ridiculous

wanting

such

any

that
any

entertained
as
to
owen

as
mad
as

is
only
able
to
provide
himself
and
his

with
the

that
man
'

is
living
in
poverty
since
he
cannot
enjoy
the
advantages
of
civilization
he
might
just
as
well
be
a
savage
better
in
fact
for
a
savage
knows
nothing
of
what
he
is
deprived
what
we
call
civilization
the
accumulation
of
knowledge
which
has
come
down
to
us
from
our
forefathers
-
is
the
fruit
of
thousands
of
years
of
human
thought

not
the

of
the

of
any
separate
class
of
people
who
exist
today
and
therefore
it
is
by
right
the
common
heritage
of
all
every
little
child
that
is
born
into
the

excel

in
one

at

he

he

one
of
the
heirs

all
the
ages
that
have
gone
before
some
of

began
to
wonder
whether
owen
was
not
sane
after
all
he
certainly
must
be
a
clever
sort
of
chap
to
be
able
to
talk
like
this
it
sounded
almost
like
something
out
of
a
book
and
most
of
them
could
not
understand
one
half
of
it
`
why
is
it
continued
owen
`
that
we
are
not
only
deprived
of
our
inheritance
-
we
are
not
only
deprived
of
nearly
all
the
benefits
of
civilization
but
we
and
our
children
and
also
often
unable
to
obtain
even
the
bare
necessaries
of
existence
no
one
answered
`
all
these
things
owen

produced
by
those
who
work
we
do
our
full

we
should
have
a
full
share

the

that
are
made
by

the
others
continued
silent
harlow
thought
of
the
over

population
theory
but
decided
not
to
mention
it
crass
who
could
not
have
given
an
intelligent
answer
to
save
his
life
for
once
had
sufficient
sense
to
remain
silent
he
did
think
of
calling
out
the
patent
paint
-
pumping
machine
and
bringing
the
hosepipe
to
bear
on
the
subject
but
abandoned
the
idea
after
all
he
thought
what
was
the
use
of
arguing
with
such
a
fool
as
owen
sawkins
pretended
to
be
asleep
philpot
however
had
suddenly
grown
very
serious
`
as
things
are
now
went
on
owen
`
instead
of
enjoying
the
advantages
of
civilization
we
are
really
worse
off
than
slaves
for
if
we
were
slaves
our
owners
in
their
own
interest
would
see
to
it
that
we
always
had
food
and
-
`
oh
i
do
not
see
that
roughly
interrupted
old
linden
who
had
been
listening
with
evident
anger
and
impatience
`
you

heard
in
the
passage
leading
to
the
kitchen

misery

perhaps
the
bloke
himself

hurriedly
pulled
out

to

snatching
a
piece

the

crass
rushed
over
to
the
bucket

began
stirring
up
the
stale
whitewash
it
contained
and
the
stench
which
it
gave
forth
was
simply
appalling

extent
of
which
was
perceived
only
when
he
opened
it
to
bellow
at
the
workmen
his
exhortations
to
greater
exertions
his
chin
was
large
and
extraordinarily
long
the
eyes
were
pale
blue
very
small
and
close
together
surmounted
by
spare
light
-
coloured
almost
invisible
eyebrows
with
a
deep
vertical
cleft
between
them
over
the
nose
his
head
covered
with
thick
coarse
brown
hair
was
very
large
at
the
back
the
ears
were
small
and
laid
close
to
the
head
if
one
were
to
make
a
full
-
face
drawing
of
his
cadaverous
visage
it
would
be
found
that
the
outline
resembled
that
of
the
lid
of
a
coffin
this
man
had
been
with
rushton
-
no
one
had
ever
seen
the
`
co
'
for
fifteen
years
in
fact
almost
from
the
time
when
the
latter
commenced
business
rushton
had
at
that
period
realized
the
necessity
of
having
a
deputy
who
could
be
used
to
do
all
the
drudgery
and
running
about
so
that
he
himself
might
be
free
to
attend
to
the
more
pleasant
or
profitable
matters
hunter
was
then
a
journeyman
but
was
on
the
point
of
starting
on
his
own
account
when
rushton
offered
him
a
constant
job
as
foreman
two
pounds
a
week
and
two
and
a
half
per
cent
of
the
profits
of
all
work
done
on
the
face
of
it
this
appeared
a
generous
offer
hunter
closed
with
it
gave
up
the
idea
of
starting
for
himself
and
threw
himself
heart
and
mind
into
the
business
when
an
estimate
was
to
be
prepared
it
was
hunter
who
measured
up
the
work
and
laboriously
figured
out
the
probably
cost
when
their
tenders
were
accepted
it
was
he
who
superintended
the
work
and
schemed
how
to
scamp
it
where
possible
using
mud
where
mortar
was
specified
mortar
where
there
ought
to
have
been
cement
sheet
zinc
where
they
were
supposed
to
put
sheet
lead
boiled
oil
instead
of
varnish
and
three
coats
of
paint
where
five
were
paid
for
in
fact
scamping
the
work
was
with
this
man
a
kind
of
mania
it
grieved
him
to
see
anything
done
properly
even
when
it
was
more
economical
to
do
a
thing
well
he
insisted
from
force
of
habit
on
having
it
scamped
then
he
was
almost
happy
because
he
felt
that
he
was
doing
someone
down
if
there
were
an
architect
superintending
the
work
misery
would
square
him
or
bluff
him
if
it
were
not
possible
to
do
either
at
least
he
had
a
try
and
in
the
intervals
of
watching
driving
and
bullying
the
hands
his
vulture
eye
was
ever
on
the
look
out
for
fresh
jobs
his
long
red
nose
was
thrust
into
every
estate
agent
'
s
office
in
the
town
in
the
endeavour
to
smell
out
what
properties
had
recently
changed
hands
or
been
let
in
order
that
he
might
interview
the
new
owners
and
secure
the
order
for
whatever
alterations
or
repairs
might
be
required
he
it
was
who
entered
into
unholy
compacts
with
numerous
charwomen
and
nurses
of
the
sick
who
in
return
for
a
small
commission
would
let
him
know
when
some
poor
sufferer
was
passing
away
and
would
recommend
rushton
&
co
to
the
bereaved
and
distracted
relatives
by
these
means
often
-
after
first
carefully
inquiring
into
the
financial
position
of
the
stricken
family
-
misery
would
contrive
to
wriggle
his
unsavoury
carcass
into
the
house
of
sorrow
seeking
even
in
the
chamber
of
death
to
further
the
interests
of
rushton
&
co
and
to
earn
his
miserable
two
and
a
half
per
cent
it
was
to
make
possible
the
attainment
of
this
object
that
misery
slaved
and
drove
and
schemed
and
cheated
it
was
for
this
that
the
workers
'
wages
were
cut
down
to
the
lowest
possible
point
and
their
offspring
went
ill
clad
ill
shod
and
ill
fed
and
were
driven
forth
to
labour
while
they
were
yet
children
because
their
fathers
were
unable
to
earn
enough
to
support
their
homes
fifteen
years
hunter
realized
now
that
rushton
had
had
considerably
the
best
of
the
bargain
in
the
first
place
it
will
be
seen
that
the
latter
had
bought
over
one
who
might
have
proved
a
dangerous
competitor
and
now
after
fifteen
years
the
business
that
had
been
so
laboriously
built
up
mainly
by
hunter
'
s
energy
industry
and
unscrupulous
cunning
belonged
to
rushton
&
co
hunter
was
but
an
employee
liable
to
dismissal
like
any
other
workman
the
only
difference
being
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
week
'
s
notice
instead
of
an
hour
'
s
notice
and
was
but
little
better
off
financially
than
when
he
started
for
the
firm
fifteen
years
hunter
knew
now
that
he
had
been
used
but
he
also
knew
that
it
was
too
late
to
turn
back
he
had
not
saved
enough
to
make
a
successful
start
on
his
own
account
even
if
he
had
felt
mentally
and
physically
capable
of
beginning
all
over
again
and
if
rushton
were
to
discharge
him
right
now
he
was
too
old
to
get
a
job
as
a
journeyman
further
in
his
zeal
for
rushton
&
co
and
his
anxiety
to
earn
his
commission
he
had
often
done
things
that
had
roused
the
animosity
of
rival
firms
to
such
an
extent
that
it
was
highly
improbable
that
any
of
them
would
employ
him
and
even
if
they
would
misery
'
s
heart
failed
him
at
the
thought
of
having
to
meet
on
an
equal
footing
those
workmen
whom
he
had
tyrannized
over
and
oppressed
it
was
for
these
reasons
that
hunter
was
as
terrified
of
rushton
as
the
hands
were
of
himself
over
the
men
stood
misery
ever
threatening
them
with
dismissal
and
their
wives
and
children
with
hunger
behind
misery
was
rushton
ever
bullying
and
goading
him
on
to
greater
excuses
and
efforts
for
the
furtherance
of
the
good
cause
-
which
was
to
enable
the
head
of
the
firm
to
accumulate
money
mr
hunter
at
the
moment
when
the
reader
first
makes
his
acquaintance
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
when
the
incidents
recorded
in
the
first
chapter
took
place
was
executing
a
kind
of
strategic
movement
in
the
direction
of
the
house
where
crass
and
his
mates
were
working
he
kept
to
one
side
of
the
road
because
by
so
doing
he
could
not
be
perceived
by
those
within
the
house
until
the
instant
of
his
arrival
when
he
was
within
about
a
hundred
yards
of
the
gate
he
dismounted
from
his
bicycle
there
being
a
sharp
rise
in
the
road
just
there
and
as
he
toiled
up
pushing
the
bicycle
in
front
his
breath
showing
in
white
clouds
in
the
frosty
air
he
observed
a
number
of
men
hanging
about
some
of
them
he
knew
they
had
worked
for
him
at
various
times
but
where
now
out
of
a
job
there
were
five
men
altogether
three
of
them
were
standing
in
a
group
the
other
two
stood
each
by
himself
being
apparently
strangers
to
each
other
and
the
first
three
the
three
men
who
stood
together
were
nearest
to
hunter
and
as
the
latter
approached
one
of
them
advanced
to
meet
him
`
good
afternoon
sir
hunter
replied
by
an
inarticulate
grunt
without
stopping
the
man
followed
`
any
chance
of
a
job
sir
`
full
up
replied
hunter
still
without
stopping
the
man
still
followed
like
a
beggar
soliciting
charity
`
be
any
use
calling
in
a
day
or
so
sir
'
do
not
think
so
hunter
replied
`
can
if
you
like
but
we
are
full
up
'
thank
you
sir
said
the
man
and
turned
back
to
his
friends
by
this
time
hunter
was
within
a
few
yards
of
one
of
the
other
two
men
who
also
came
to
speak
to
him
this
man
felt
there
was
no
hope
of
getting
a
job
still
there
was
no
harm
in
asking
besides
he
was
getting
desperate
it
was
over
a
month
now
since
he
had
finished
up
for
his
last
employer
it
had
been
a
very
slow
summer
altogether
sometimes
a
fortnight
for
one
firm
then
perhaps
a
week
doing
nothing
then
three
weeks
or
a
month
for
another
firm
then
out
again
and
so
on
and
now
it
was
november
last
winter
they
had
got
into
debt
that
was
nothing
unusual
but
owing
to
the
bad
summer
they
had
not
been
able
as
in
other
years
to
pay
off
the
debts
accumulated
in
winter
it
was
doubtful
too
whether
they
would
be
able
to
get
credit
again
this
winter
in
fact
this
morning
when
his
wife
sent
their
little
girl
to
the
grocer
'
s
for
some
butter
the
latter
had
refused
to
let
the
child
have
it
without
the
money
so
although
he
felt
it
to
be
useless
he
accosted
hunter
this
time
hunter
stopped
he
was
winded
by
his
climb
up
the
hill
`
good
afternoon
sir
hunter
did
not
return
the
salutation
he
had
not
the
breath
to
spare
but
the
man
was
not
hurt
he
was
used
to
being
treated
like
that
`
any
chance
of
a
job
sir
hunter
did
not
reply
at
once
he
was
short
of
breath
and
he
was
thinking
of
a
plan
that
was
ever
recurring
to
his
mind
and
which
he
had
lately
been
hankering
to
put
into
execution
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
long
waited
for
opportunity
had
come
just
now
rushton
&
co
were
almost
the
only
firm
in
mugsborough
who
had
any
work
there
were
dozens
of
good
workmen
out
yes
this
was
the
time
if
this
man
agreed
he
would
give
him
a
start
hunter
knew
the
man
was
a
good
workman
he
had
worked
for
rushton
&
co
before
to
make
room
for
him
old
linden
and
some
other
full
-
price
man
could
be
got
rid
of
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
find
some
excuse
`
well
hunter
said
at
last
in
a
doubtful
hesitating
kind
of
way
`
i
am
afraid
not
newman
we
are
about
full
up
he
ceased
speaking
and
remained
waiting
for
the
other
to
say
something
more
he
did
not
look
at
the
man
but
stooped
down
fidgeting
with
the
mechanism
of
the
bicycle
as
if
adjusting
it
`
things
have
been
so
bad
this
summer
newman
went
on
`
i
'
ve
had
rather
a
rough
time
of
it
i
would
be
very
glad
of
a
job
even
if
it
was
only
for
a
week
or
so
there
was
a
pause
after
a
while
hunter
raised
his
eyes
to
the
other
'
s
face
but
immediately
let
them
fall
again
`
well
said
he
`
i
might
perhaps
be
able
to
let
you
have
a
day
or
two
you
can
come
here
to
this
job
and
he
nodded
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
house
where
the
men
were
working
`
tomorrow
at
seven
of
course
you
know
the
figure
he
added
as
newman
was
about
to
thank
him
`
six
and
a
half
hunter
spoke
as
if
the
reduction
were
already
an
accomplished
fact
the
man
was
more
likely
to
agree
if
he
thought
that
others
were
already
working
at
the
reduced
rate
newman
was
taken
by
surprise
and
hesitated
he
had
never
worked
under
price
indeed
he
had
sometimes
gone
hungry
rather
than
do
so
but
now
it
seemed
that
others
were
doing
it
and
then
he
was
so
awfully
hard
up
if
he
refused
this
job
he
was
not
likely
to
get
another
in
a
hurry
he
thought
of
his
home
and
his
family
already
they
owed
five
weeks
'
rent
and
last
monday
the
collector
had
hinted
pretty
plainly
that
the
landlord
would
not
wait
much
longer
not
only
that
but
if
he
did
not
get
a
job
how
were
they
to
live
this
morning
he
himself
had
had
no
breakfast
to
speak
of
only
a
cup
of
tea
and
some
dry
bread
these
thoughts
crowded
upon
each
other
in
his
mind
but
still
he
hesitated
hunter
began
to
move
off
`
well
he
said
`
if
you
like
to
start
you
can
come
here
at
seven
in
the
morning
then
as
newman
still
hesitated
he
added
impatiently
`
are
you
coming
or
not
`
yes
sir
said
newman
`
all
right
said
hunter
affably
`
i
will
tell
crass
to
have
a
kit
ready
for
you
he
nodded
in
a
friendly
way
to
the
man
who
went
off
feeling
like
a
criminal
as
hunter
resumed
his
march
well
pleased
with
himself
the
fifth
man
who
had
been
waiting
all
this
time
came
to
meet
him
as
he
approached
hunter
recognized
him
as
one
who
had
started
work
for
rushton
&
co
early
in
the
summer
but
who
had
left
suddenly
of
his
own
accord
having
taken
offence
at
some
bullying
remark
of
hunter
'
s
hunter
was
glad
to
see
this
man
he
guessed
that
the
fellow
must
be
very
hard
pressed
to
come
again
and
ask
for
work
after
what
had
happened
`
any
chance
of
a
job
sir
hunter
appeared
to
reflect
`
i
believe
i
have
room
for
one
he
said
at
length
`
but
you
are
such
an
uncertain
kind
of
chap
you
do
not
seem
to
care
much
whether
you
work
or
not
you
are
too
independent
you
know
one
ca
not
say
two
words
to
you
but
you
must
needs
clear
off
the
man
made
no
answer
`
we
ca
not
tolerate
that
kind
of
thing
you
know
hunter
added
`
if
we
were
to
encourage
men
of
your
stamp
we
should
never
know
where
we
are
so
saying
hunter
moved
away
and
again
proceeded
on
his
journey
when
he
arrived
within
about
three
yards
of
the
gate
he
noiselessly
laid
his
machine
against
the
garden
fence
the
high
evergreens
that
grew
inside
still
concealed
him
from
the
observation
of
anyone
who
might
be
looking
out
of
the
windows
of
the
house
then
he
carefully
crept
along
till
he
came
to
the
gate
post
and
bending
down
he
cautiously
peeped
round
to
see
if
he
could
detect
anyone
idling
or
talking
or
smoking
there
was
no
one
in
sight
except
old
jack
linden
who
was
rubbing
down
the
lobby
doors
with
pumice
-
stone
and
water
hunter
noiselessly
opened
the
gate
and
crept
quietly
along
the
grass
border
of
the
garden
path
his
idea
was
to
reach
the
front
door
without
being
seen
so
that
linden
could
not
give
notice
of
his
approach
to
those
within
in
this
he
succeeded
and
passed
silently
into
the
house
he
did
not
speak
to
linden
to
do
so
would
have
proclaimed
his
presence
to
the
rest
he
crawled
stealthily
over
the
house
but
was
disappointed
in
his
quest
for
everyone
he
saw
was
hard
at
work
upstairs
he
noticed
that
the
door
of
one
of
the
rooms
was
closed
old
joe
philpot
had
been
working
in
this
room
all
day
washing
off
the
old
whitewash
from
the
ceiling
and
removing
the
old
papers
from
the
walls
with
a
broad
bladed
square
topped
knife
called
a
stripper
although
it
was
only
a
small
room
joe
had
had
to
tear
into
the
work
pretty
hard
all
the
time
for
the
ceiling
seemed
to
have
had
two
or
three
coats
of
whitewash
without
ever
having
been
washed
off
and
there
were
several
thicknesses
of
paper
on
the
walls
the
difficulty
of
removing
these
papers
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
there
was
a
dado
which
had
been
varnished
in
order
to
get
this
off
it
had
been
necessary
to
soak
it
several
times
with
strong
soda
water
and
although
joe
was
as
careful
as
possible
he
had
not
been
able
to
avoid
getting
some
of
this
stuff
on
his
fingers
the
result
was
that
his
nails
were
all
burnt
and
discoloured
and
the
flesh
round
them
cracked
and
bleeding
however
he
had
got
it
all
off
at
last
and
he
was
not
sorry
for
his
right
arm
and
shoulder
were
aching
from
the
prolonged
strain
and
in
the
palm
of
the
right
hand
there
was
a
blister
as
large
as
a
shilling
caused
by
the
handle
of
the
stripping
knife
all
the
old
paper
being
off
joe
washed
down
the
walls
with
water
and
having
swept
the
paper
into
a
heap
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
he
mixed
with
a
small
