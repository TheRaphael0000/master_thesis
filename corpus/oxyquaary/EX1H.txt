the
sluggish
day
began
to
break
.
even
its
position
terrestrially
is
one
of
the
elements
of
a
new
interest
,
and
for
no
particular
reason
save
that
the
incident
of
the
night
had
occurred
there
,
oak
went
again
into
the
plantation
.
lingering
and
musing
here
,
he
heard
the
steps
of
a
horse
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
and
soon
there
appeared
in
view
an
auburn
pony
with
a
girl
on
its
back
,
ascending
by
the
path
leading
past
the
cattle
-
shed
.
she
was
the
young
woman
of
the
night
before
.
gabriel
instantly
thought
of
the
hat
she
had
mentioned
as
having
lost
in
the
wind
;
possibly
she
had
come
to
look
for
it
.
he
hastily
scanned
the
ditch
and
after
walking
about
ten
yards
along
it
,
found
the
hat
among
the
leaves
.
gabriel
took
it
in
his
hand
and
returned
to
his
hut
.
here
he
ensconced
himself
,
and
peeped
through
the
loophole
in
the
direction
of
the
riders
approach
.
she
came
up
and
looked
around
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
.
gabriel
was
about
to
advance
and
restore
the
missing
article
when
an
unexpected
performance
induced
him
to
suspend
the
action
for
the
present
.
the
path
,
after
passing
the
cowshed
,
bisected
the
plantation
.
it
was
not
a
bridle
-
path
merely
a
pedestrian
'
s
track
,
and
the
boughs
spread
horizontally
at
a
height
not
greater
than
seven
feet
above
the
ground
,
which
made
it
impossible
to
ride
erect
beneath
them
.
the
girl
,
who
wore
no
riding
-
habit
,
looked
around
for
a
moment
,
as
if
to
assure
herself
that
all
humanity
was
out
of
view
,
then
dexterously
dropped
backwards
flat
upon
the
pony
'
s
back
,
her
head
over
its
tail
,
her
feet
against
its
shoulders
,
and
her
eyes
to
the
sky
.
the
rapidity
of
her
glide
into
this
position
was
that
of
a
kingfisher
its
noiselessness
that
of
a
hawk
.
gabriel
'
s
eyes
had
scarcely
been
able
to
follow
her
.
the
tall
lank
pony
seemed
used
to
such
doings
,
and
ambled
along
unconcerned
.
thus
she
passed
under
the
level
boughs
.
the
performer
seemed
quite
at
home
anywhere
between
a
horse
'
s
head
and
its
tail
,
and
the
necessity
for
this
abnormal
attitude
having
ceased
with
the
passage
of
the
plantation
,
she
began
to
adopt
another
,
even
more
obviously
convenient
than
the
first
.
she
had
no
side
-
saddle
,
and
it
was
very
apparent
that
a
firm
seat
upon
the
smooth
leather
beneath
her
was
unattainable
sideways
.
springing
to
her
accustomed
perpendicular
like
a
bowed
sapling
,
and
satisfying
her
,
self
that
nobody
was
in
sight
,
she
seated
herself
in
the
manner
demanded
by
the
saddle
,
though
hardly
expected
of
the
woman
,
and
trotted
off
in
the
direction
of
tewnell
mill
.
oak
was
amused
,
perhaps
a
little
astonished
,
and
hanging
up
the
hat
in
his
hut
,
went
again
among
his
ewes
.
an
hour
passed
,
the
girl
returned
,
properly
seated
now
,
with
a
bag
of
bran
in
front
of
her
.
on
nearing
the
cattle
-
shed
she
was
met
by
a
boy
bringing
a
milking
-
pail
,
who
held
the
reins
of
the
pony
whilst
she
slid
off
.
the
boy
led
away
the
horse
,
leaving
the
pail
with
the
young
woman
.
soon
soft
shirts
alternating
with
loud
shirts
came
in
regular
succession
from
within
the
shed
,
the
obvious
sounds
of
a
person
milking
a
cow
.
gabriel
took
the
lost
hat
in
his
hand
,
and
waited
beside
the
path
she
would
follow
in
leaving
the
hill
.
she
came
,
the
pail
in
one
hand
,
hanging
against
her
knee
.
the
left
arm
was
extended
as
a
balance
,
enough
of
it
being
shown
bare
to
make
oak
wish
that
the
event
ha
happened
in
the
summer
,
when
the
whole
would
have
been
revealed
.
there
was
a
bright
air
and
manner
about
her
now
,
by
which
she
seemed
to
imply
that
the
desirability
of
her
existence
could
not
be
questioned
;
and
this
rather
saucy
assumption
failed
in
being
offensive
,
because
a
beholder
felt
it
to
be
,
upon
the
whole
,
true
.
like
exceptional
emphasis
in
the
tone
of
a
genius
,
that
which
would
have
made
mediocrity
ridiculous
was
an
addition
to
recognised
power
.
it
was
with
some
surprise
that
she
saw
gabriel
'
s
face
rising
like
the
moon
behind
the
hedge
.
the
adjustment
of
the
farmer
'
s
hazy
conceptions
of
her
charms
to
the
portrait
of
herself
she
now
presented
him
with
was
less
a
diminution
than
a
difference
.
the
starting
-
point
selected
by
the
judgment
was
.
her
height
she
seemed
tall
,
but
the
pail
was
a
small
one
,
and
the
hedge
diminutive
;
hence
,
making
allowance
for
error
by
comparison
with
these
,
she
could
have
been
not
above
the
height
to
be
chosen
by
women
as
best
.
all
features
of
consequence
were
severe
and
regular
.
it
may
have
been
observed
by
persons
who
go
about
the
shires
with
eyes
for
beauty
,
that
in
englishwoman
a
classically
formed
face
is
seldom
found
to
be
united
with
a
figure
of
the
same
pattern
,
the
highly
-
finished
features
being
generally
too
large
for
the
remainder
of
the
frame
;
that
a
graceful
and
proportionate
figure
of
eight
heads
usually
goes
off
into
random
facial
curves
.
without
throwing
a
nymphean
tissue
over
a
milkmaid
,
let
it
be
said
that
here
criticism
checked
itself
as
out
of
place
,
and
looked
at
her
proportions
with
a
long
consciousness
of
pleasure
.
from
the
contours
of
her
figure
in
its
upper
part
,
she
must
have
had
a
beautiful
neck
and
shoulders
;
but
since
her
infancy
nobody
had
ever
seen
them
.
had
she
been
put
into
a
low
dress
she
would
have
run
and
thrust
her
head
into
a
bush
.
yet
she
was
not
a
shy
girl
by
any
means
;
it
was
merely
her
instinct
to
draw
the
line
dividing
the
seen
from
the
unseen
higher
than
they
do
it
in
towns
.
that
the
girl
'
s
thoughts
hovered
about
her
face
and
form
as
soon
as
she
caught
oak
'
s
eyes
conning
the
same
page
was
natural
,
and
almost
certain
.
the
self
-
consciousness
shown
would
have
been
vanity
if
a
little
more
pronounced
,
dignity
if
a
little
less
.
rays
of
male
vision
seem
to
have
a
tickling
effect
upon
virgin
faces
in
rural
districts
;
she
brushed
hers
with
her
hand
,
as
if
gabriel
had
been
irritating
its
pink
surface
by
actual
touch
,
and
the
free
air
of
her
previous
movements
was
reduced
at
the
same
time
to
a
chastened
phase
of
itself
.
yet
it
was
the
man
who
blushed
,
the
maid
not
at
all
.
i
found
a
hat
.
said
oak
.
it
is
mine
.
said
she
,
and
,
from
a
sense
of
proportion
,
kept
down
to
a
small
smile
an
inclination
to
laugh
distinctly
:
it
flew
away
last
night
.
one
o
'
clock
this
morning
?
well
it
was
.
she
was
surprised
.
how
did
you
know
?
she
said
.
i
was
here
.
you
are
farmer
oak
,
are
you
not
?
that
or
thereabouts
.
i
am
lately
come
to
this
place
.
a
large
farm
?
she
inquired
,
casting
her
eyes
round
,
and
swinging
back
her
hair
,
which
was
black
in
the
shaded
hollows
of
its
mass
;
but
it
being
now
an
hour
past
sunrise
,
the
rays
touched
its
prominent
curves
with
a
colour
of
their
own
.
no
;
not
large
.
about
a
hundred
.
(
in
speaking
of
farms
the
word
acres
is
omitted
by
the
natives
,
by
analogy
to
such
old
expressions
as
a
stag
of
ten
.
)
i
wanted
my
hat
this
morning
.
she
went
on
.
i
had
to
ride
to
tewnell
mill
.
yes
you
had
.
how
do
you
know
?
i
saw
you
!
where
?
she
inquired
,
a
misgiving
bringing
every
muscle
of
her
lineaments
and
frame
to
a
standstill
.
here
going
through
the
plantation
,
and
all
down
the
hill
.
said
farmer
oak
,
with
an
aspect
excessively
knowing
with
regard
to
some
matter
in
his
mind
,
as
he
gazed
at
a
remote
point
in
the
direction
named
,
and
then
turned
back
to
meet
his
colloquist
'
s
eyes
.
a
perception
caused
him
to
withdraw
his
own
eyes
from
hers
as
suddenly
as
if
he
had
been
caught
in
a
theft
.
recollection
of
the
strange
antics
she
had
indulged
in
when
passing
through
the
trees
,
was
succeeded
in
the
girl
by
a
nettled
palpitation
,
and
that
by
a
hot
face
.
it
was
a
time
to
see
a
woman
redden
who
was
not
given
to
reddening
as
a
rule
;
not
a
point
in
the
milkmaid
but
was
of
the
deepest
rose
-
colour
.
from
the
maiden
'
s
blush
,
through
all
varieties
of
the
provence
down
to
the
crimson
tuscany
,
the
countenance
of
oak
'
s
acquaintance
quickly
graduated
;
whereupon
he
,
in
considerateness
,
turned
away
his
head
.
the
sympathetic
man
still
looked
the
other
way
,
and
wondered
when
she
would
recover
coolness
sufficient
to
justify
him
in
facing
her
again
.
he
heard
what
seemed
to
be
the
flitting
of
a
dead
leaf
upon
the
breeze
,
and
looked
.
she
had
gone
away
.
with
an
air
between
that
of
tragedy
and
comedy
!
gabriel
returned
to
his
work
.
five
mornings
and
evenings
passed
.
the
young
woman
came
regularly
to
milk
the
healthy
cow
or
to
attend
to
the
sick
one
,
but
never
allowed
her
vision
to
stray
in
the
direction
of
oak
'
s
person
.
his
want
of
tact
had
deeply
offended
her
not
by
seeing
what
he
could
not
help
,
but
by
letting
her
know
that
he
had
seen
it
.
for
,
as
without
law
there
is
no
sin
,
without
eyes
there
is
no
indecorum
;
and
she
appeared
to
feel
that
gabriel
'
s
espial
had
made
her
an
indecorous
woman
without
her
own
connivance
.
it
was
food
for
great
regret
with
him
;
it
was
also
a
contretemps
which
touched
into
life
a
latent
heat
he
had
experienced
in
that
direction
.
the
acquaintanceship
might
,
however
,
have
ended
in
a
slow
forgetting
,
but
for
an
incident
which
occurred
at
the
end
of
the
same
week
.
one
afternoon
it
began
to
freeze
,
and
the
frost
increased
with
evening
,
which
drew
on
like
a
stealthy
tightening
of
bonds
.
it
was
a
time
when
in
cottages
the
breath
of
the
sleepers
freezes
to
the
sheets
;
when
round
the
drawing
-
room
fire
of
a
thick
-
walled
mansion
the
sitters
'
backs
are
cold
,
even
whilst
their
faces
are
all
aglow
.
many
a
small
bird
went
to
bed
supperless
that
night
among
the
bare
boughs
.
as
the
milking
-
hour
drew
near
,
oak
kept
his
usual
watch
upon
the
cowshed
.
at
last
he
felt
cold
,
and
shaking
an
extra
quantity
of
bedding
round
the
yearling
ewes
he
entered
the
hut
and
heaped
more
fuel
upon
the
stove
.
the
wind
came
in
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
,
and
to
prevent
it
oak
laid
a
sack
there
and
wheeled
the
cot
round
a
little
more
to
the
south
.
then
the
wind
spouted
in
at
a
ventilating
hole
of
which
there
was
one
on
each
side
of
the
hut
.
gabriel
had
always
known
that
when
the
fire
was
lighted
and
the
door
closed
one
of
these
must
be
kept
open
that
chosen
being
always
on
the
side
away
from
the
wind
.
closing
the
slide
to
windward
,
he
turned
to
open
the
other
;
on
second
thoughts
the
farmer
considered
that
he
would
first
sit
down
leaving
both
closed
for
a
minute
or
two
,
till
the
temperature
of
the
hut
was
a
little
raised
.
he
sat
down
.
his
head
began
to
ache
in
an
unwonted
manner
,
and
,
fancying
himself
weary
by
reason
of
the
broken
rests
of
the
preceding
nights
,
oak
decided
to
get
up
,
open
the
slide
,
and
then
allow
himself
to
fall
asleep
.
he
fell
asleep
,
however
,
without
having
performed
the
necessary
preliminary
.
how
long
he
remained
unconscious
gabriel
never
knew
.
during
the
first
stages
of
his
return
to
perception
peculiar
deeds
seemed
to
be
in
course
of
enactment
.
his
dog
was
howling
,
his
head
was
aching
fearfully
somebody
was
pulling
him
about
,
hands
were
loosening
his
neckerchief
.
on
opening
his
eyes
he
found
that
evening
had
sunk
to
dusk
in
a
strange
manner
of
unexpectedness
.
the
young
girl
with
the
remarkably
pleasant
lips
and
white
teeth
was
beside
him
.
more
than
this
astonishingly
more
his
head
was
upon
her
lap
,
his
face
and
neck
were
disagreeably
wet
,
and
her
fingers
were
unbuttoning
his
collar
.
whatever
is
the
matter
?
said
oak
,
vacantly
.
she
seemed
to
experience
mirth
,
but
of
too
insignificant
a
kind
to
start
enjoyment
.
nothing
now
'
,
she
answered
,
since
you
are
not
dead
it
is
a
wonder
you
were
not
,
suffocated
in
this
hut
of
yours
.
ah
,
the
hut
!
murmured
gabriel
.
i
gave
ten
pounds
for
that
hut
.
but
i
will
sell
it
,
and
sit
under
thatched
hurdles
as
they
did
in
old
times
,
curl
up
to
sleep
in
a
lock
of
straw
!
it
played
me
nearly
the
same
trick
the
other
day
!
gabriel
,
by
way
of
emphasis
,
brought
down
his
fist
upon
the
floor
.
it
was
not
exactly
the
fault
of
the
hut
.
she
observed
in
a
tone
which
showed
her
to
be
that
novelty
among
women
one
who
finished
a
thought
before
beginning
the
sentence
which
was
to
convey
it
.
you
should
i
think
,
have
considered
,
and
not
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
leave
the
slides
closed
.
yes
i
suppose
i
should
.
said
oak
,
absently
.
he
was
endeavouring
to
catch
and
appreciate
the
sensation
of
being
thus
with
her
,
his
head
upon
her
dress
,
before
the
event
passed
on
into
the
heap
of
bygone
things
.
he
wished
she
knew
his
impressions
;
but
he
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
carrying
an
odour
in
a
net
as
of
attempting
to
convey
the
intangibilities
of
his
feeling
in
the
coarse
meshes
of
language
.
so
he
remained
silent
.
she
made
him
sit
up
,
and
then
oak
began
wiping
his
face
and
shaking
himself
like
a
samson
.
how
can
i
thank
'
ee
?
he
said
at
last
,
gratefully
,
some
of
the
natural
rusty
red
having
returned
to
his
face
.
oh
,
never
mind
that
.
said
the
girl
,
smiling
,
and
allowing
her
smile
to
hold
good
for
gabriel
'
s
next
remark
,
whatever
that
might
prove
to
be
.
how
did
you
find
me
?
i
heard
your
dog
howling
and
scratching
at
the
door
of
the
hut
when
i
came
to
the
milking
(
it
was
so
lucky
,
daisy
'
s
milking
is
almost
over
for
the
season
,
and
i
shall
not
come
here
after
this
week
or
the
next
)
.
the
dog
saw
me
,
and
jumped
over
to
me
,
and
laid
hold
of
my
skirt
.
i
came
across
and
looked
round
the
hut
the
very
first
thing
to
see
if
the
slides
were
closed
.
my
uncle
has
a
hut
like
this
one
,
and
i
have
heard
him
tell
his
shepherd
not
to
go
to
sleep
without
leaving
a
slide
open
.
i
opened
the
door
,
and
there
you
were
like
dead
.
i
threw
the
milk
over
you
,
as
there
was
no
water
,
forgetting
it
was
warm
,
and
no
use
.
i
wonder
if
i
should
have
died
?
gabriel
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
which
was
rather
meant
to
travel
back
to
himself
than
to
her
.
o
no
,
the
girl
replied
.
she
seemed
to
prefer
a
less
tragic
probability
;
to
have
saved
a
man
from
death
involved
talk
that
should
harmonise
with
the
dignity
of
such
a
deed
and
she
shunned
it
.
i
believe
you
saved
my
life
,
miss
i
do
not
know
your
name
.
i
know
your
aunt
'
s
,
but
not
yours
.
i
would
just
as
soon
not
tell
it
rather
not
.
there
is
no
reason
either
why
i
should
,
as
you
probably
will
never
have
much
to
do
with
me
.
still
,
i
should
like
to
know
.
you
can
inquire
at
my
aunt
'
s
she
will
tell
you
.
my
name
is
gabriel
oak
.
and
mine
isn
'
t
.
you
seem
fond
of
yours
in
speaking
it
so
decisively
,
gabriel
oak
.
you
see
,
it
is
the
only
one
i
shall
ever
have
,
and
i
must
make
the
most
of
it
.
i
always
think
mine
sounds
odd
and
disagreeable
.
i
should
think
you
might
soon
get
a
new
one
.
mercy
!
how
many
opinions
you
keep
about
you
concerning
other
people
,
gabriel
oak
.
well
miss
excuse
the
words
i
thought
you
would
like
them
but
i
ca
not
match
you
i
know
in
napping
out
my
mind
upon
my
tongue
.
i
never
was
very
clever
in
my
inside
.
but
i
thank
you
.
come
give
me
your
hand
!
she
hesitated
,
somewhat
disconcerted
at
oak
'
s
old
-
fashioned
earnest
conclusion
.
to
a
dialogue
lightly
carried
on
.
very
well
.
she
said
,
and
gave
him
her
hand
,
compressing
her
lips
to
a
demure
impassivity
.
he
held
it
but
an
instant
,
and
in
his
fear
of
being
too
demonstrative
,
swerved
to
the
opposite
extreme
,
touching
her
fingers
with
the
lightness
of
a
small
-
hearted
person
.
i
am
sorry
.
he
said
,
the
instant
after
.
what
for
?
you
may
have
it
again
if
you
like
;
there
it
is
.
she
gave
him
her
hand
again
.
oak
held
it
longer
this
time
indeed
,
curiously
long
.
how
soft
it
is
being
winter
time
,
too
not
chapped
or
rough
or
anything
!
he
said
.
there
that
'
s
long
enough
.
said
she
,
though
without
pulling
it
away
but
i
suppose
you
are
thinking
you
would
like
to
kiss
it
?
you
may
if
you
want
to
.
i
was
not
thinking
of
any
such
thing
.
said
gabriel
,
simply
;
but
i
will
that
you
won
'
t
!
she
snatched
back
her
hand
.
gabriel
felt
himself
guilty
of
another
want
of
tact
.
now
find
out
my
name
.
she
said
,
teasingly
;
and
withdrew
.
the
only
superiority
in
women
that
is
tolerable
to
the
rival
sex
is
,
as
a
rule
,
that
of
the
unconscious
kind
;
but
a
superiority
which
recognizes
itself
may
sometimes
please
by
suggesting
possibilities
of
capture
to
the
subordinated
man
.
this
well
-
favoured
and
comely
girl
soon
made
appreciable
inroads
upon
the
emotional
constitution
of
young
farmer
oak
.
love
,
being
an
extremely
exacting
usurer
(
a
sense
of
exorbitant
profit
,
spiritually
,
by
an
exchange
of
hearts
,
being
at
the
bottom
of
pure
passions
,
as
that
of
exorbitant
profit
,
bodily
or
materially
,
is
at
the
bottom
of
those
of
lower
atmosphere
)
,
every
morning
oak
'
s
feelings
were
as
sensitive
as
the
money
-
market
in
calculations
upon
his
chances
.
his
dog
waited
for
his
meals
in
a
way
so
like
that
in
which
oak
waited
for
the
girl
'
s
presence
,
that
the
farmer
was
quite
struck
with
the
resemblance
,
felt
it
lowering
,
and
would
not
look
at
the
dog
.
however
,
he
continued
to
watch
through
the
hedge
for
her
regular
coming
,
and
thus
his
sentiments
towards
her
were
deepened
without
any
corresponding
effect
being
produced
upon
herself
.
oak
had
nothing
finished
and
ready
to
say
as
yet
,
and
not
being
able
to
frame
love
phrases
which
end
where
they
begin
;
passionate
tales
full
of
sound
and
fury
signifying
nothing
he
said
no
word
at
all
.
by
making
inquiries
he
found
that
the
girl
'
s
name
was
bathsheba
everdene
,
and
that
the
cow
would
go
dry
in
about
seven
days
.
he
dreaded
the
eight
day
.
at
last
the
eighth
day
came
.
the
cow
had
ceased
to
give
milk
for
that
year
,
and
bathsheba
everdene
came
up
the
hill
no
more
.
gabriel
had
reached
a
pitch
of
existence
he
never
could
have
anticipated
a
short
time
before
.
he
liked
saying
`
bathsheba
'
as
a
private
enjoyment
instead
of
whistling
;
turned
over
his
taste
to
black
hair
,
though
he
had
sworn
by
brown
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
,
isolated
himself
till
the
space
he
filled
in
a
possible
strength
in
an
actual
weakness
.
marriage
transforms
a
distraction
into
a
support
,
the
power
of
which
should
be
,
and
happily
often
is
,
in
direct
proportion
to
the
degree
of
imbecility
it
supplants
.
oak
began
now
to
see
light
in
this
direction
,
and
said
to
himself
,
i
will
make
her
my
wife
,
or
upon
my
soul
i
shall
be
good
for
nothing
!
all
this
while
he
was
perplexing
himself
about
an
errand
on
which
he
might
consistently
visit
the
cottage
of
bathsheba
'
s
aunt
.
he
found
his
opportunity
in
the
death
of
a
ewe
,
mother
of
a
living
lamb
.
on
a
day
which
had
a
summer
face
and
a
winter
constitution
a
fine
january
morning
,
when
there
was
just
enough
blue
sky
visible
to
make
cheerfully
-
disposed
people
wish
for
more
,
and
an
occasional
gleam
of
silvery
sunshine
,
oak
put
the
lamb
into
a
respectable
sunday
basket
,
and
stalked
across
the
fields
to
the
house
of
mrs
hurst
,
the
aunt
george
,
the
dog
walking
behind
,
with
a
countenance
of
great
concern
at
the
serious
turn
pastoral
affairs
seemed
to
be
taking
.
gabriel
had
watched
the
blue
wood
-
smoke
curling
from
the
chimney
with
strange
meditation
.
at
evening
he
had
fancifully
traced
it
down
the
chimney
to
the
spot
of
its
origin
seen
the
hearth
and
bathsheba
beside
it
beside
it
in
her
out
-
door
dress
;
for
the
clothes
she
had
worn
on
the
hill
were
by
association
equally
with
her
person
included
in
the
compass
of
his
affection
;
they
seemed
at
this
early
time
of
his
love
a
necessary
ingredient
of
the
sweet
mixture
called
bathsheba
everdene
.
he
had
made
a
toilet
of
a
nicely
-
adjusted
kind
of
a
nature
between
the
carefully
neat
and
the
carelessly
ornate
of
a
degree
between
fine
-
market
-
day
and
wet
-
sunday
selection
.
he
thoroughly
cleaned
his
silver
watch
-
chain
with
whiting
,
put
new
lacing
straps
to
his
boots
,
looked
to
the
brass
eyelet
-
holes
,
went
to
the
inmost
heart
of
the
plantation
for
a
new
walking
-
stick
,
and
trimmed
it
vigorously
on
his
way
back
;
took
a
new
handkerchief
from
the
bottom
of
his
clothes
-
box
,
put
on
the
light
waistcoat
patterned
all
over
with
sprigs
of
an
elegant
flower
uniting
the
beauties
of
both
rose
and
lily
without
the
defects
of
either
,
and
used
all
the
hair
-
oil
he
possessed
upon
his
usually
dry
,
sandy
,
and
inextricably
curly
hair
,
till
he
had
deepened
it
to
a
splendidly
novel
colour
,
between
that
of
guano
and
roman
cement
,
making
it
stick
to
his
head
like
mace
round
a
nutmeg
,
or
wet
seaweed
round
a
boulder
after
the
ebb
.
nothing
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
cottage
save
the
chatter
of
a
knot
of
sparrows
on
the
eaves
;
one
might
fancy
scandal
and
rumour
to
be
no
less
the
staple
topic
of
these
little
coteries
on
roofs
than
of
those
under
them
.
it
seemed
that
the
omen
was
an
unpropitious
one
,
for
,
as
the
rather
untoward
commencement
of
oak
'
s
overtures
,
just
as
he
arrived
by
the
garden
gate
,
he
saw
a
cat
inside
,
going
into
various
arched
shapes
and
fiendish
convulsions
at
the
sight
of
his
dog
george
.
the
dog
took
no
notice
,
for
he
had
arrived
at
an
age
at
which
all
superfluous
barking
was
cynically
avoided
as
a
waste
of
breath
in
fact
he
never
barked
even
at
the
sheep
except
to
order
,
when
it
was
done
with
an
absolutely
neutral
countenance
,
as
a
sort
of
com
-
mination
-
service
,
which
,
though
offensive
,
had
to
be
gone
through
once
now
and
then
to
frighten
the
flock
for
their
own
good
.
a
voice
came
from
behind
some
laurel
-
bushes
into
which
the
cat
had
run
:
poor
dear
!
did
a
nasty
brute
of
a
dog
want
to
kill
it
;
did
he
poor
dear
!
i
beg
your
pardon
.
said
oak
to
the
voice
,
but
george
was
walking
on
behind
me
with
a
temper
as
mild
as
milk
.
almost
before
he
had
ceased
speaking
,
oak
was
seized
with
a
misgiving
as
to
whose
ear
was
the
recipient
of
his
answer
.
nobody
appeared
,
and
he
heard
the
person
retreat
among
the
bushes
.
gabriel
meditated
,
and
so
deeply
that
he
brought
small
furrows
into
his
forehead
by
sheer
force
of
reverie
.
where
the
issue
of
an
interview
is
as
likely
to
be
a
vast
change
for
the
worse
as
for
the
better
,
any
initial
difference
from
expectation
causes
nipping
sensations
of
failure
.
oak
went
up
to
the
door
a
little
abashed
:
his
mental
rehearsal
and
the
reality
had
had
no
common
grounds
of
opening
.
bathsheba
'
s
aunt
was
indoors
.
will
you
tell
miss
everdene
that
somebody
would
be
glad
to
speak
to
her
?
said
mr
oak
.
(
calling
one
'
s
self
merely
somebody
,
without
giving
a
name
,
is
not
to
be
taken
as
an
example
of
the
ill
-
breeding
of
the
rural
world
:
it
springs
from
a
refined
modesty
,
of
which
townspeople
,
with
their
cards
and
announcements
,
have
no
notion
whatever
.
)
bathsheba
was
out
.
the
voice
had
evidently
been
hers
.
will
you
come
in
,
mr
oak
?
oh
,
thank
'
ee
,
said
gabriel
,
following
her
to
the
fireplace
.
i
'
ve
brought
a
lamb
for
miss
everdene
.
i
thought
she
might
like
one
to
rear
;
girls
do
.
she
might
.
said
mrs
hurst
,
musingly
;
though
she
is
only
a
visitor
here
.
if
you
will
wait
a
minute
,
bathsheba
will
be
in
.
yes
,
i
will
wait
.
said
gabriel
,
sitting
down
.
the
lamb
is
not
really
the
business
i
came
about
,
mrs
hurst
.
in
short
,
i
was
going
to
ask
her
if
she
'
d
like
to
be
married
.
and
were
you
indeed
?
yes
.
because
if
she
would
,
i
should
be
very
glad
to
marry
her
.
d
'
ye
know
if
she
is
got
any
other
young
man
hanging
about
her
at
all
?
let
me
think
,
said
mrs
hurst
,
poking
the
fire
superfluously
.
.
.
.
yes
bless
you
,
ever
so
many
young
men
.
you
see
,
farmer
oak
,
she
is
so
good
-
looking
,
and
an
excellent
scholar
besides
she
was
going
to
be
a
governess
once
,
you
know
,
only
she
was
too
wild
.
not
that
her
young
men
ever
come
here
but
,
lord
,
in
the
nature
of
women
,
she
must
have
a
dozen
!
that
'
s
unfortunate
.
said
farmer
oak
,
contemplating
a
crack
in
the
stone
floor
with
sorrow
.
i
am
only
an
every
-
day
sort
of
man
,
and
my
only
chance
was
in
being
the
first
comer
.
.
.
,
well
,
there
'
s
no
use
in
my
waiting
,
for
that
was
all
i
came
about
:
so
i
will
take
myself
off
home
-
along
,
mrs
hurst
.
when
gabriel
had
gone
about
two
hundred
yards
along
the
down
,
he
heard
a
hoi
-
hoi
!
uttered
behind
him
,
in
a
piping
note
of
more
treble
quality
than
that
in
which
the
exclamation
usually
embodies
itself
when
shouted
across
a
field
.
he
looked
round
,
and
saw
a
girl
racing
after
him
,
waving
a
white
handkerchief
.
oak
stood
still
and
the
runner
drew
nearer
.
it
was
bathsheba
everdene
.
gabriel
'
s
colour
deepened
:
hers
was
already
deep
,
not
,
as
it
appeared
,
from
emotion
,
but
from
running
.
farmer
oak
i
she
said
,
pausing
for
want
of
breath
pulling
up
in
front
of
him
with
a
slanted
face
and
putting
her
hand
to
her
side
.
i
have
just
called
to
see
you
,
said
gabriel
,
pending
her
further
speech
.
yes
i
know
that
!
she
said
panting
like
a
robin
,
her
face
red
and
moist
from
her
exertions
,
like
a
peony
petal
before
the
sun
dries
off
the
dew
.
i
did
not
know
you
had
come
to
ask
to
have
me
,
or
i
should
have
come
in
from
the
garden
instantly
.
i
ran
after
you
to
say
that
my
aunt
made
a
mistake
in
sending
you
away
from
courting
me
gabriel
expanded
.
i
am
sorry
to
have
made
you
run
so
fast
,
my
dear
.
he
said
,
with
a
grateful
sense
of
favours
to
come
.
wait
a
bit
till
you
'
ve
found
your
breath
.
it
was
quite
a
mistake
aunt
'
s
telling
you
i
had
a
young
man
already
.
bathsheba
went
on
.
i
have
not
a
sweetheart
at
all
and
i
never
had
one
,
and
i
thought
that
,
as
times
go
with
women
,
it
was
such
a
pity
to
send
you
away
thinking
that
i
had
several
.
really
and
truly
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
!
said
farmer
oak
,
smiling
one
of
his
long
special
smiles
,
and
blushing
with
gladness
.
he
held
out
his
hand
to
take
hers
,
which
,
when
she
had
eased
her
side
by
pressing
it
there
,
was
prettily
extended
upon
her
bosom
to
still
her
loud
-
beating
heart
.
directly
he
seized
it
she
put
it
behind
her
,
so
that
it
slipped
through
his
fingers
like
an
eel
.
i
have
a
nice
snug
little
farm
.
said
gabriel
,
with
half
a
degree
less
assurance
than
when
he
had
seized
her
hand
.
yes
;
you
have
.
a
man
has
advanced
me
money
to
begin
with
,
but
still
,
it
will
soon
be
paid
off
and
though
i
am
only
an
every
-
day
sort
of
man
,
i
have
got
on
a
little
since
i
was
a
boy
.
gabriel
uttered
a
little
in
a
tone
to
show
her
that
it
was
the
complacent
form
of
a
great
deal
.
e
continued
:
when
we
be
married
,
i
am
quite
sure
i
can
work
twice
as
hard
as
i
do
now
.
he
went
forward
and
stretched
out
his
arm
again
.
bathsheba
had
overtaken
him
at
a
point
beside
which
stood
a
low
stunted
holly
bush
,
now
laden
with
red
berries
.
seeing
his
advance
take
the
form
of
an
attitude
threatening
a
possible
enclosure
,
if
not
compression
,
of
her
person
,
she
edged
off
round
the
bush
.
why
,
farmer
oak
.
she
said
,
over
the
top
,
looking
at
him
with
rounded
eyes
,
i
never
said
i
was
going
to
marry
you
.
well
that
is
a
tale
!
said
oak
,
with
dismay
.
to
run
after
anybody
like
this
,
and
then
say
you
do
not
want
him
!
what
i
meant
to
tell
you
was
only
this
.
she
said
eagerly
,
and
yet
half
conscious
of
the
absurdity
of
the
position
she
had
made
for
herself
that
nobody
has
got
me
yet
as
a
sweetheart
,
instead
of
my
having
a
dozen
,
as
my
aunt
said
;
i
hate
to
be
thought
men
'
s
property
in
that
way
,
though
possibly
i
shall
be
had
some
day
.
why
,
if
i
'
d
wanted
you
i
should
not
have
run
after
you
like
this
;
'
twould
have
been
the
forwardest
thing
!
but
there
was
no
harm
in
'
hurrying
to
correct
a
piece
of
false
news
that
had
been
told
you
.
oh
,
no
no
harm
at
all
.
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
being
too
generous
in
expressing
a
judgment
impulsively
,
and
oak
added
with
a
more
appreciative
sense
of
all
the
circumstances
well
,
i
am
not
quite
certain
it
was
no
harm
.
indeed
,
i
had
not
time
to
think
before
starting
whether
i
wanted
to
marry
or
not
,
for
you
'
d
have
been
gone
over
the
hill
.
come
.
said
gabriel
,
freshening
again
;
think
a
minute
or
two
.
i
will
wait
a
while
,
miss
everdene
.
will
you
marry
me
?
do
,
bathsheba
.
i
love
you
far
more
than
common
!
i
will
try
to
think
.
she
observed
,
rather
more
timorously
;
if
i
can
think
out
of
doors
;
my
mind
spreads
away
so
.
but
you
can
give
a
guess
.
then
give
me
time
.
bathsheba
looked
thoughtfully
into
the
distance
,
away
from
the
direction
in
which
gabriel
stood
.
i
can
make
you
happy
,
said
he
to
the
back
of
her
head
,
across
the
bush
.
you
shall
have
as
piano
in
a
year
or
two
farmers
'
wives
are
getting
to
have
pianos
now
and
i
will
practise
up
the
flute
right
well
to
play
with
you
in
the
evenings
.
yes
;
i
should
like
that
.
and
have
one
of
those
little
ten
-
pound
gigs
for
market
and
nice
flowers
,
and
birds
cocks
and
hens
i
mean
,
because
they
be
useful
.
continued
gabriel
,
feeling
balanced
between
poetry
and
practicality
.
i
should
like
it
very
much
.
and
a
frame
for
cucumbers
like
a
gentleman
and
lady
.
yes
.
and
when
the
wedding
was
over
,
we
'
d
have
it
put
in
the
newspaper
list
of
marriages
.
dearly
i
should
like
that
!
and
the
babies
in
the
births
every
man
jack
of
em
!
and
at
home
by
the
fire
,
whenever
you
look
up
,
there
i
shall
be
and
whenever
i
look
up
there
will
be
you
.
wait
wait
and
do
not
be
improper
!
her
countenance
fell
,
and
she
was
silent
awhile
.
he
regarded
the
red
berries
between
them
over
and
over
again
,
to
such
an
extent
,
that
holly
seemed
in
his
after
life
to
be
a
cypher
signifying
a
proposal
of
marriage
.
bathsheba
decisively
turned
to
him
.
no
;
'
tis
no
use
.
she
said
.
i
do
not
want
to
marry
you
.
try
.
i
have
tried
hard
all
the
time
i
'
ve
been
thinking
;
for
a
marriage
would
be
very
nice
in
one
sense
.
people
would
talk
about
me
,
and
think
i
had
won
my
battle
,
and
i
should
feel
triumphant
,
and
all
that
,
but
a
husband
well
!
why
,
he
'
d
always
be
there
,
as
you
say
;
whenever
i
looked
up
,
there
he
'
d
be
.
of
course
he
would
i
,
that
is
.
well
,
what
i
mean
is
that
i
should
not
mind
being
a
bride
at
a
wedding
,
if
i
could
be
one
without
having
a
husband
.
but
since
a
woman
ca
not
show
off
in
that
way
by
herself
,
i
sha
not
marry
at
least
yet
.
that
'
s
a
terrible
wooden
story
.
at
this
criticism
of
her
statement
bathsheba
made
an
addition
to
her
dignity
by
a
slight
sweep
away
from
him
.
upon
my
heart
and
soul
,
i
do
not
know
what
a
maid
can
say
stupider
than
that
.
said
oak
.
but
dearest
.
he
continued
in
a
palliative
voice
,
do
not
be
like
it
!
oak
sighed
a
deep
honest
sigh
none
the
less
so
in
that
,
being
like
the
sigh
of
a
pine
plantation
,
it
was
rather
noticeable
as
a
disturbance
of
the
atmosphere
.
why
wo
not
you
have
me
?
he
appealed
,
creeping
round
the
holly
to
reach
her
side
.
i
cannot
.
she
said
,
retreating
.
but
why
?
he
persisted
,
standing
still
at
last
in
despair
of
ever
reaching
her
,
and
facing
over
the
bush
.
because
i
do
not
love
you
.
yes
,
but
she
contracted
a
yawn
to
an
inoffensive
smallness
,
so
that
it
was
hardly
ill
-
mannered
at
all
.
i
do
not
love
you
.
she
said
.
but
i
love
you
and
,
as
for
myself
,
i
am
content
to
be
liked
.
o
mr
oak
that
'
s
very
fine
!
you
'
d
get
to
despise
me
.
never
.
said
mr
oak
,
so
earnestly
that
he
seemed
to
be
coming
,
by
the
force
of
his
words
,
straight
through
the
bush
and
into
her
arms
.
i
shall
do
one
thing
in
this
life
one
thing
certain
that
is
,
love
you
,
and
long
for
you
,
and
keep
wanting
you
till
i
die
.
his
voice
had
a
genuine
pathos
now
,
and
his
large
brown
hands
perceptibly
trembled
.
it
seems
dreadfully
wrong
not
to
have
you
when
you
feel
so
much
!
she
said
with
a
little
distress
,
and
looking
hopelessly
around
for
some
means
of
escape
from
her
moral
dilemma
.
how
i
wish
i
had
not
run
after
you
!
however
she
seemed
to
have
a
short
cut
for
getting
back
to
cheerfulness
,
and
set
her
face
to
signify
archness
.
it
would
not
do
,
mr
oak
.
i
want
somebody
to
tame
me
;
i
am
too
independent
;
and
you
would
never
be
able
to
,
i
know
.
oak
cast
his
eyes
down
the
field
in
a
way
implying
that
it
was
useless
to
attempt
argument
.
mr
oak
.
she
said
,
with
luminous
distinctness
and
common
sense
,
you
are
better
off
than
i
.
i
have
hardly
a
penny
in
the
world
i
am
staying
with
my
aunt
for
my
bare
sustenance
.
i
am
better
educated
than
you
and
i
do
not
love
you
a
bit
:
that
'
s
my
side
of
the
case
.
now
yours
:
you
are
a
farmer
just
beginning
;
and
you
ought
in
common
prudence
,
if
you
marry
at
all
(
which
you
should
certainly
not
think
of
doing
at
present
)
to
marry
a
woman
with
money
,
who
would
admiration
.
that
'
s
the
very
thing
i
had
been
thinking
myself
!
he
naively
said
.
farmer
oak
had
one
-
and
-
a
-
half
christian
characteristics
too
many
to
succeed
with
bathsheba
:
his
humility
,
and
a
superfluous
moiety
of
honesty
.
bathsheba
was
decidedly
disconcerted
,
well
,
then
,
why
did
you
come
and
disturb
me
?
she
said
,
almost
angrily
,
if
not
quite
,
an
enlarging
red
spot
rising
in
each
cheek
.
i
ca
not
do
what
i
think
would
be
would
be
right
?
no
:
wise
.
you
have
made
an
admission
now
,
mr
oak
.
she
exclaimed
,
with
even
more
hauteur
,
and
rocking
her
head
disdainfully
.
after
that
,
do
you
think
i
could
marry
you
?
not
if
i
know
it
.
he
broke
in
passionately
.
but
do
not
mistake
me
like
that
!
because
i
am
open
enough
to
own
what
every
man
in
my
shoes
would
have
thought
of
,
you
make
your
colours
come
up
your
face
,
and
get
crabbed
with
me
.
that
about
your
not
being
good
enough
for
me
is
nonsense
.
you
speak
like
a
lady
all
the
parish
notice
it
,
and
your
uncle
at
weatherbury
is
,
i
have
heerd
,
a
large
farmer
much
larger
than
ever
i
shall
be
.
may
i
call
in
the
evening
,
or
will
you
walk
along
with
me
o
'
sundays
?
i
do
not
want
you
to
make
up
your
mind
at
once
,
if
you
'
d
rather
not
.
no
no
i
cannot
.
do
not
press
me
any
more
don
'
t
.
i
do
not
love
you
so
'
twould
be
ridiculous
,
he
said
,
with
a
laugh
.
no
man
likes
to
see
his
emotions
the
sport
of
a
merry
-
go
-
round
of
skittishness
.
very
well
.
said
oak
,
firmly
,
with
the
bearing
of
one
who
was
going
to
give
his
days
and
nights
to
ecclesiastes
for
ever
.
then
i
will
ask
you
no
more
.
the
news
which
one
day
reached
gabriel
,
that
bathsheba
everdene
had
left
the
neighbourhood
,
had
an
influence
upon
him
which
might
have
surprised
any
who
never
suspected
that
the
more
emphatic
the
renunciation
the
less
absolute
its
character
.
it
may
have
been
observed
that
there
is
no
regula
path
for
getting
out
of
love
as
there
is
for
getting
in
.
some
people
look
upon
marriage
as
a
short
cut
that
way
,
but
it
has
been
known
to
fail
.
separation
,
which
was
the
means
that
chance
offered
to
gabriel
oak
by
bathsheba
'
s
disappearance
though
effectual
with
people
of
certain
humours
is
apt
to
idealise
the
removed
object
with
others
notably
those
whose
affection
,
placid
and
regular
as
it
may
be
flows
deep
and
long
.
oak
belonged
to
the
even
-
tempered
order
of
humanity
,
and
felt
the
secret
fusion
of
himself
in
bathsheba
to
be
burning
with
a
finer
flame
now
that
she
was
gone
that
was
all
.
his
incipient
friendship
with
her
aunt
had
been
nipped
by
the
failure
of
his
suit
,
and
all
that
oak
learnt
of
bathsheba
'
s
movements
was
done
indirectly
.
it
appeared
that
she
had
gone
to
a
place
called
weatherbury
,
more
than
twenty
miles
off
,
but
in
what
capacity
whether
as
a
visitor
,
or
permanently
,
he
could
not
discover
.
gabriel
had
two
dogs
.
george
,
the
elder
,
exhibited
an
ebony
-
tipped
nose
,
surrounded
by
a
narrow
margin
of
pink
flesh
,
and
a
coat
marked
in
random
splotches
approximating
in
colour
to
white
and
slaty
grey
;
but
the
grey
,
after
years
of
sun
and
rain
,
had
been
scorched
and
washed
out
of
the
more
prominent
locks
,
leaving
them
of
a
reddish
-
brown
,
as
if
the
blue
component
of
the
grey
had
faded
,
like
the
indigo
from
the
same
kind
of
colour
in
turner
'
s
pictures
.
in
substance
it
had
originally
been
hair
,
but
long
contact
with
sheep
seemed
to
be
turning
it
by
degrees
into
wool
of
a
poor
quality
and
staple
.
this
dog
had
originally
belonged
to
a
shepherd
of
inferior
morals
and
dreadful
temper
,
and
the
result
was
that
george
knew
the
exact
degrees
of
condemnation
signified
by
cursing
and
swearing
of
all
descriptions
better
than
the
wickedest
old
man
in
the
neighbourhood
.
long
experience
had
so
precisely
taught
the
animal
the
difference
between
such
exclamations
as
come
in
!
and
d
ye
,
come
in
!
that
he
knew
to
a
hair
'
s
breadth
the
rate
of
trotting
back
from
the
ewes
'
tails
that
each
call
involved
,
if
a
staggerer
with
the
sheep
crook
was
to
be
escaped
.
though
old
,
he
was
clever
and
trustworthy
still
.
the
young
dog
,
george
'
s
son
,
might
possibly
have
been
the
image
of
his
mother
,
for
there
was
not
much
resemblance
between
him
and
george
.
he
was
learning
the
sheep
-
keeping
business
,
so
as
to
follow
on
at
the
flock
when
the
other
should
die
,
but
had
got
no
further
than
the
rudiments
as
yet
still
finding
an
insuperable
difficulty
in
distinguishing
between
doing
a
thing
well
enough
and
doing
it
too
well
.
so
earnest
and
yet
so
wrong
-
headed
was
this
young
dog
(
he
had
no
,
name
in
particular
,
and
answered
with
perfect
readiness
to
any
pleasant
interjection
)
,
that
if
sent
behind
the
flock
to
help
them
on
,
he
did
it
so
thoroughly
that
he
would
have
chased
them
across
the
whole
county
with
the
greatest
pleasure
if
not
called
off
or
reminded
when
to
step
by
the
example
of
old
george
.
thus
much
for
the
dogs
.
on
the
further
side
of
norcombe
hill
was
a
chalk
-
pit
,
from
which
chalk
had
been
drawn
for
generations
,
and
spread
over
adjacent
farms
.
two
hedges
converged
upon
it
in
the
form
of
a
v
,
but
without
quite
meeting
.
the
narrow
opening
left
,
which
was
immediately
over
the
brow
of
the
pit
,
was
protected
by
a
rough
railing
.
one
night
,
when
farmer
oak
had
returned
to
,
his
house
,
believing
there
would
be
no
further
necessity
for
his
attendance
on
the
down
,
he
called
as
usual
to
the
dogs
,
previously
to
shutting
them
up
in
the
outhouse
till
next
morning
.
only
one
responded
old
george
;
the
other
could
not
be
found
,
either
in
the
house
,
lane
,
or
garden
.
gabriel
then
remembered
that
he
had
left
the
two
dogs
on
the
hill
eating
a
dead
lamb
(
a
kind
of
meat
he
usually
kept
from
them
,
except
when
other
food
ran
finished
his
meal
,
he
went
indoors
to
the
luxury
of
a
bed
,
which
latterly
he
had
only
enjoyed
on
sundays
.
it
was
a
still
,
moist
night
.
just
before
dawn
he
was
assisted
in
waking
by
the
abnormal
reverberation
of
familiar
music
.
to
the
shepherd
,
the
note
of
the
sheep
chronic
sound
that
only
makes
itself
noticed
by
ceasing
ever
distant
,
that
all
is
well
in
the
fold
.
in
the
solemn
this
exceptional
ringing
may
be
caused
in
two
ways
by
the
rapid
feeding
of
the
sheep
bearing
the
bell
,
as
when
the
flock
breaks
into
new
pasture
,
which
gives
it
an
intermittent
rapidity
,
or
by
the
sheep
starting
off
in
a
run
,
when
the
sound
has
a
regular
palpitation
.
the
experienced
ear
of
oak
knew
the
sound
he
now
heard
to
be
caused
by
the
running
of
the
flock
with
great
velocity
.
he
jumped
out
of
bed
,
dressed
,
tore
down
the
lane
through
a
foggy
dawn
,
and
ascended
the
hill
.
the
forward
ewes
were
kept
apart
from
those
among
which
the
fall
of
lambs
would
be
later
,
there
being
two
hundred
of
the
latter
class
in
gabriel
'
s
flock
.
these
two
hundred
seemed
to
have
absolutely
vanished
from
the
hill
.
there
were
the
fifty
with
their
lambs
,
enclosed
at
the
other
end
as
he
had
left
them
,
but
the
rest
,
forming
the
bulk
of
the
flock
,
were
nowhere
.
gabriel
called
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
shepherd
'
s
call
.
ovey
,
ovey
,
ovey
!
not
a
single
bleat
.
he
went
to
the
hedge
a
gap
had
been
broken
through
it
,
and
in
the
gap
were
the
footprints
of
the
sheep
.
rather
surprised
to
find
them
break
fence
at
this
season
,
yet
putting
it
down
instantly
to
their
great
fondness
for
ivy
in
winter
-
time
,
of
which
a
great
deal
grew
in
the
plantation
,
he
followed
through
the
hedge
.
they
were
not
in
the
plantation
.
he
called
again
:
the
valleys
and
farthest
hills
resounded
as
when
the
sailors
invoked
the
lost
hylas
on
the
mysian
shore
;
but
no
sheep
.
he
passed
through
the
trees
and
along
the
ridge
of
the
hill
.
on
the
extreme
summit
,
where
the
ends
of
the
two
converging
hedges
of
which
we
have
spoken
were
stopped
short
by
meeting
the
brow
of
the
chalk
-
pit
,
he
saw
the
younger
dog
standing
against
the
sky
dark
and
motionless
as
napoleon
at
st
.
helena
.
a
horrible
conviction
darted
through
oak
.
with
a
sensation
of
bodily
faintness
he
advanced
:
at
one
point
the
rails
were
broken
through
,
and
there
he
saw
the
footprints
of
his
ewes
.
the
dog
came
up
,
licked
his
hand
,
and
made
signs
implying
that
he
expected
some
great
reward
for
signal
services
rendered
.
oak
looked
over
the
precipice
.
the
ewes
lay
dead
and
dying
at
its
foot
a
heap
of
two
hundred
mangled
carcasses
,
representing
in
their
condition
just
now
at
least
two
hundred
more
.
oak
was
an
intensely
humane
man
:
indeed
,
his
humanity
often
tore
in
pieces
any
politic
intentions
of
his
which
bordered
on
strategy
,
and
carried
him
on
as
by
gravitation
.
a
shadow
in
his
life
had
always
been
that
his
flock
ended
in
mutton
that
a
day
came
and
found
every
shepherd
an
arrant
traitor
to
his
defenseless
sheep
.
his
first
feeling
now
was
one
of
pity
for
the
untimely
fate
of
these
gentle
ewes
and
their
unborn
lambs
.
it
was
a
second
to
remember
another
phase
of
the
matter
.
the
sheep
were
not
insured
.
all
the
savings
of
a
frugal
life
had
been
dispersed
at
a
blow
;
his
hopes
of
being
an
independent
farmer
were
laid
low
possibly
for
ever
.
gabriel
'
s
energies
,
patience
,
and
industry
had
been
so
severely
taxed
during
the
years
of
his
life
between
eighteen
and
eight
-
and
-
twenty
,
to
reach
his
present
stage
of
progress
that
no
more
seemed
to
be
left
in
him
.
he
hands
.
stupors
,
however
,
do
not
last
for
ever
,
and
farmer
oak
recovered
from
his
.
it
was
as
remarkable
as
it
was
characteristic
that
the
one
sentence
he
uttered
was
in
thankfulness
:
thank
god
i
am
not
married
:
what
would
she
have
done
in
the
poverty
now
coming
upon
me
!
oak
raised
his
head
,
and
wondering
what
he
could
do
listlessly
surveyed
the
scene
.
by
the
outer
margin
of
the
pit
was
an
oval
pond
,
and
over
it
hung
the
attenuated
skeleton
of
a
chrome
-
yellow
moon
which
had
only
a
few
days
to
last
the
morning
star
dogging
her
on
the
left
hand
.
the
pool
glittered
like
a
dead
man
'
s
eye
,
and
as
the
world
awoke
a
breeze
blew
,
shaking
and
elongating
the
reflection
of
the
moon
without
breaking
it
,
and
turning
the
image
of
the
star
to
a
phosphoric
streak
upon
the
water
.
all
this
oak
saw
and
remembered
.
as
far
as
could
be
learnt
it
appeared
that
the
poor
young
dog
,
still
under
the
impression
that
since
he
was
kept
for
running
after
sheep
,
the
more
he
ran
after
them
the
better
,
had
at
the
end
of
his
meal
off
the
dead
lamb
,
which
may
have
given
him
additional
energy
and
spirits
,
collected
all
the
ewes
into
a
corner
,
driven
the
timid
creatures
through
the
hedge
,
across
the
upper
field
,
and
by
main
force
of
worrying
had
given
them
momentum
enough
to
break
down
a
portion
of
the
rotten
railing
,
and
so
hurled
them
over
the
edge
.
george
'
s
son
had
done
his
work
so
thoroughly
that
he
was
considered
too
good
a
workman
to
live
,
and
was
,
in
fact
,
taken
and
tragically
shot
at
twelve
o
'
clock
that
same
day
another
instance
of
the
untoward
fate
which
so
often
attends
dogs
and
other
philosophers
who
follow
out
a
train
of
reasoning
to
its
logical
conclusion
,
and
attempt
perfectly
consistent
conduct
in
a
world
made
up
so
largely
of
compromise
.
gabriel
'
s
farm
had
been
stocked
by
a
dealer
on
the
strength
of
oak
'
s
promising
look
and
character
who
was
receiving
a
percentage
from
the
farmer
till
such
time
as
the
advance
should
be
cleared
off
oak
found
that
the
value
of
stock
,
plant
,
and
implements
which
were
really
his
own
would
be
about
sufficient
to
pay
his
debts
,
leaving
himself
a
free
man
with
the
clothes
he
stood
up
in
,
and
nothing
more
.
two
months
passed
away
.
we
are
brought
on
to
a
day
in
february
,
on
which
was
held
the
yearly
statute
or
hiring
fair
in
the
county
-
town
of
casterbridge
.
at
one
end
of
the
street
stood
from
two
to
three
hundred
blithe
and
hearty
labourers
waiting
upon
chance
all
men
of
the
stamp
to
whom
labour
suggests
nothing
worse
than
a
wrestle
with
gravitation
,
and
pleasure
nothing
better
than
a
renunciation
of
the
same
among
these
,
carters
and
waggoners
were
distinguished
by
having
a
piece
of
whip
-
cord
twisted
round
their
hats
;
thatchers
wore
a
fragment
of
woven
straw
;
shepherds
held
their
sheep
-
crooks
in
their
hands
;
and
thus
the
situation
required
was
known
to
the
hirers
at
a
glance
.
in
the
crowd
was
an
athletic
young
fellow
of
somewhat
superior
appearance
to
the
rest
in
fact
,
his
superiority
was
marked
enough
to
lead
several
ruddy
peasants
standing
by
to
speak
to
him
inquiringly
,
as
to
a
farmer
,
and
to
use
`
sir
'
as
a
finishing
word
.
his
answer
always
was
,
i
am
looking
for
a
place
myself
a
bailiff
'
s
.
do
ye
know
of
anybody
who
wants
one
?
gabriel
was
paler
now
.
his
eyes
were
more
meditative
,
and
his
expression
was
more
sad
.
he
had
passed
through
an
ordeal
of
wretchedness
which
had
given
him
more
than
it
had
taken
away
.
he
had
sunk
from
his
modest
elevation
as
pastoral
king
into
the
very
slime
-
pits
of
siddim
;
but
there
was
left
to
him
a
dignified
calm
he
had
never
before
known
,
and
that
indifference
to
fate
which
,
though
it
often
makes
a
villain
of
a
man
,
is
the
basis
of
his
sublimity
when
it
does
not
.
and
thus
the
abasement
had
been
exaltation
,
and
the
loss
gain
.
in
the
morning
a
regiment
of
cavalry
had
left
the
town
,
and
a
sergeant
and
his
party
had
been
beating
up
for
recruits
through
the
four
streets
.
as
the
end
of
the
day
drew
on
,
and
he
found
himself
not
hired
,
gabriel
almost
wished
that
he
had
joined
them
,
and
gone
off
to
serve
his
country
.
weary
of
standing
in
the
market
-
place
,
and
not
much
minding
the
kind
of
work
he
turned
his
hand
to
,
he
decided
to
offer
himself
in
some
other
capacity
than
that
of
bailiff
.
all
the
farmers
seemed
to
be
wanting
shepherds
.
sheep
-
tending
was
gabriel
'
s
speciality
.
turning
down
an
obscure
street
and
entering
an
obscurer
lane
,
he
went
up
to
a
smith
'
s
shop
.
how
long
would
it
take
you
to
make
a
shepherd
'
s
crook
?
twenty
minutes
.
how
much
?
two
shillings
.
he
sat
on
a
bench
and
the
crook
was
made
,
a
stem
being
given
him
into
the
bargain
.
he
then
went
to
a
ready
-
made
clothes
'
shop
,
the
owner
of
which
had
a
large
rural
connection
.
as
the
crook
had
absorbed
most
of
gabriel
'
s
money
,
he
attempted
,
and
carried
out
,
an
exchange
of
his
overcoat
for
a
shepherd
'
s
regulation
smock
-
frock
.
this
transaction
having
been
completed
,
he
again
hurried
off
to
the
centre
of
the
town
,
and
stood
on
the
kerb
of
the
pavement
,
as
a
shepherd
,
crook
in
hand
.
now
that
oak
had
turned
himself
into
a
shepherd
,
it
seemed
that
bailifs
were
most
in
demand
.
however
,
two
or
three
farmers
noticed
him
and
drew
near
.
dialogues
followed
,
more
or
lessin
the
subjoined
for
:
where
do
you
come
from
?
norcombe
.
that
'
s
a
long
way
.
fifteen
miles
.
who
'
s
farm
were
you
upon
last
?
my
own
.
this
reply
invariably
operated
like
a
rumour
of
cholera
.
the
inquiring
farmer
would
edge
away
and
shake
his
head
dubiously
.
gabriel
,
like
his
dog
,
was
too
good
to
be
trustworthy
,
.
and
he
never
made
advance
beyond
this
point
.
it
is
safer
to
accept
any
chance
that
offers
itself
,
and
extemporize
a
procedure
to
fit
it
,
than
to
get
a
good
shepherd
,
but
had
laid
himself
out
for
anything
in
the
whole
cycle
of
labour
that
was
required
in
the
fair
.
it
grew
dusk
.
some
merry
men
were
whistling
and
singing
by
the
corn
-
exchange
.
gabriel
'
s
hand
,
which
had
lain
for
some
time
idle
in
his
smock
-
frock
pocket
,
touched
his
flute
which
he
carried
there
.
here
was
an
opportunity
for
putting
his
dearly
bought
wisdom
into
practice
.
he
drew
out
his
flute
and
began
to
play
jockey
to
the
fair
in
the
style
of
a
man
who
had
never
known
moment
'
s
sorrow
.
oak
could
pipe
with
arcadian
sweetness
and
the
sound
of
the
well
-
known
notes
cheered
his
own
heart
as
well
as
those
of
the
loungers
.
he
played
on
with
spirit
,
and
in
half
an
hour
had
earned
in
pence
what
was
a
small
fortune
to
a
destitute
man
.
by
making
inquiries
he
learnt
that
there
was
another
fair
at
shottsford
the
next
day
.
how
far
is
shottsford
?
ten
miles
t
'
other
side
of
weatherbury
.
weatherbury
!
it
was
where
bathsheba
had
gone
two
months
before
.
this
information
was
like
coming
from
night
into
noon
.
how
far
is
it
to
weatherbury
?
five
or
six
miles
.
bathsheba
had
probably
left
weatherbury
long
before
this
time
,
but
the
place
had
enough
interest
attaching
to
it
to
lead
oak
to
choose
shottsford
fair
as
his
next
field
of
inquiry
,
because
it
lay
in
the
weatherbury
quarter
.
moreover
,
the
weatherbury
folk
were
by
no
means
uninteresting
intrinsically
.
if
report
spoke
truly
they
were
as
hardy
,
merry
,
thriving
,
wicked
a
set
as
any
in
the
whole
county
.
oak
resolved
to
sleep
at
weatherbury
that
night
on
his
way
to
shottsford
,
and
struck
out
at
once
into
the
high
road
which
had
been
recommended
as
the
direct
route
to
the
village
in
question
.
the
road
stretched
through
water
-
meadows
traversed
by
little
brooks
,
whose
quivering
surfaces
were
braided
along
their
centres
,
and
folded
into
creases
at
the
sides
;
or
,
where
the
flow
was
more
rapid
,
the
stream
was
pied
with
spots
of
white
froth
,
which
rode
on
in
undisturbed
serenity
.
on
the
higher
levels
the
dead
and
dry
carcasses
of
leaves
tapped
the
ground
as
they
bowled
along
helter
-
skelter
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
wind
,
and
little
birds
in
the
hedges
were
rustling
their
feathers
and
tucking
themselves
in
comfortably
for
the
night
,
retaining
their
places
if
oak
kept
moving
,
but
flying
away
if
he
stopped
to
look
at
them
.
he
passed
by
yalbury
wood
where
the
game
-
birds
were
rising
to
their
roosts
,
and
heard
the
crack
-
voiced
cock
-
pheasants
cu
-
uck
,
cuck
,
and
the
wheezy
whistle
of
the
hens
.
by
the
time
he
had
walked
three
or
four
miles
every
shape
in
the
landscape
had
assumed
a
uniform
hue
of
blackness
.
he
descended
yalbury
hill
and
could
just
discern
ahead
of
him
a
waggon
,
drawn
up
under
a
great
over
-
hanging
tree
by
the
roadside
.
on
coming
close
,
he
found
there
were
no
horses
attached
to
it
,
the
spot
being
apparently
quite
deserted
.
the
waggon
,
from
its
position
,
seemed
to
have
been
left
there
for
the
night
,
for
beyond
about
half
a
truss
of
hay
which
was
heaped
in
the
bottom
,
it
was
quite
empty
.
gabriel
sat
down
on
the
shafts
of
the
vehicle
and

sidered
his
position
.
he
calculated
that
he
had
walked
a
very
fair
proportion
of
the
journey
;
and
having
been
on
foot
since
daybreak
,
he
felt
tempted
to
lie
down
upon
the
hay
in
the
waggon
instead
of
pushing
on
to
the
village
of
weatherbury
,
and
having
to
pay
for
a
lodging
.
eating
his
las
slices
of
bread
and
ham
,
and
drinking
from
the
bottle
of
cider
he
had
taken
the
precaution
to
bring
with
him
,
he
got
into
the
lonely
waggon
.
here
he
spread
half
of
the
hay
as
a
bed
,
and
,
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
darkness
,
pulled
the
other
half
over
him
by
way
of
bed
-
clothes
,
covering
himself
entirely
,
and
feeling
,
physically
,
as
comfortable
as
ever
he
had
been
in
his
life
.
inward
melancholy
it
was
impossible
for
a
man
like
oak
,
introspective
far
beyond
his
neighbours
,
to
banish
quite
,
whilst
conning
the
present
.
untoward
page
of
his
history
.
so
,
thinking
of
his
misfortunes
,
amorous
and
pastoral
he
fell
asleep
,
shepherds
enjoying
,
in
common
with
sailors
,
the
privilege
of
being
able
to
summon
the
god
instead
of
having
to
wait
for
him
.
on
somewhat
suddenly
awaking
after
a
sleep
of
whose
length
he
had
no
idea
,
oak
found
that
the
waggon
was
in
motion
.
he
was
being
carried
along
the
road
at
a
rate
rather
considerable
for
a
vehicle
without
springs
,
and
under
circumstances
of
physical
uneasiness
,
his
head
being
dandled
up
and
down
on
the
bed
of
the
waggon
like
a
kettledrum
-
stick
.
he
then
distinguished
voices
in
conversation
,
coming
from
the
forpart
of
the
waggon
.
his
concern
at
this
dilemma
(
which
would
have
been
alarm
,
had
he
been
a
thriving
man
;
but
misfortune
is
a
fine
opiate
to
personal
terror
)
led
him
to
peer
cautiously
from
the
hay
,
and
the
first
sight
he
beheld
was
the
stars
above
him
.
charles
'
s
wain
was
getting
towards
a
right
angle
with
the
pole
star
,
and
gabriel
concluded
that
it
must
be
about
nine
o
'
clock
in
other
words
,
that
he
had
slept
two
hours
.
this
small
astronomical
calculation
was
made
without
any
positive
effort
,
and
whilst
he
was
stealthily
turning
to
discover
,
if
possible
,
into
whose
hands
he
had
fallen
.
two
figures
were
dimly
visible
in
front
,
sitting
with
their
legs
outside
the
waggon
,
one
of
whom
was
driving
.
gabriel
soon
found
that
this
was
the
waggoner
,
and
it
appeared
they
had
come
from
casterbridge
fair
,
like
himself
.
a
conversation
was
in
progress
,
which
continued
thus
:
be
as
'
twill
,
she
is
a
fine
handsome
body
as
far
'
s
looks
be
concerned
.
but
that
'
s
only
the
skin
of
the
woman
,
and
these
dandy
cattle
be
as
proud
as
a
lucifer
in
their
insides
.
ay
so
'
a
do
seem
,
billy
smallbury
so
'
a
do
seem
.
this
utterance
was
very
shaky
by
nature
,
and
more
so
by
circumstance
,
the
jolting
of
the
waggon
not
being
without
its
effect
upon
the
speaker
'
s
larynx
.
it
came
from
the
man
who
held
the
reins
.
she
is
a
very
vain
feymell
so
'
tis
said
here
and
there
.
ah
,
now
.
if
so
be
'
tis
like
that
,
i
ca
not
look
her
in
the
face
.
lord
,
no
:
not
i
heh
-
heh
-
heh
!
such
a
shy
man
as
i
be
!
yes
she
is
very
vain
.
'
tis
said
that
every
night
at
going
to
bed
she
looks
in
the
glass
to
put
on
her
night
-
cap
properly
.
and
not
a
married
woman
.
oh
,
the
world
!
and
'
a
can
play
the
peanner
,
so
'
tis
said
.
can
play
so
clever
that
'
a
can
make
a
psalm
tune
sound
as
well
as
the
merriest
loose
song
a
man
can
wish
for
.
d
'
ye
tell
o
'
t
!
a
happy
time
for
us
,
and
i
feel
quite
a
new
man
!
and
how
do
she
play
?
that
i
do
not
know
,
master
poorgrass
.
on
hearing
these
and
other
similar
remarks
,
a
wild
thought
flashed
into
gabriel
'
s
mind
that
they
might
be
speaking
of
bathsheba
.
there
were
,
however
,
no
ground
for
retaining
such
a
supposition
,
for
the
waggon
,
though
going
in
the
direction
of
weatherbury
,
might
be
going
beyond
it
,
and
the
woman
alluded
to
seemed
to
be
the
mistress
of
some
estate
.
they
were
now
apparently
close
upon
weatherbury
and
not
to
alarm
the
speakers
unnecessarily
,
gabriel
slipped
out
of
the
waggon
unseen
.
he
turned
to
an
opening
in
the
hedge
,
which
he
found
to
be
a
gate
,
and
mounting
thereon
,
he
sat
meditating
whether
to
seek
a
cheap
lodging
in
the
village
,
or
to
ensure
a
cheaper
one
by
lying
under
some
hay
or
corn
-
stack
.
the
crunching
jangle
of
the
waggon
died
upon
his
ear
.
he
was
about
to
walk
on
,
when
he
noticed
on
his
left
hand
an
unusual
light
appearing
about
half
a
mile
distant
.
oak
watched
it
,
and
the
glow
increased
.
something
was
on
fire
.
gabriel
again
mounted
the
gate
,
and
,
leaping
down
on
the
other
side
upon
what
he
found
to
be
ploughed
soil
,
made
across
the
field
in
the
exact
direction
of
the
fire
.
the
blaze
,
enlarging
in
a
double
ratio
by
his
approach
and
its
own
increase
,
showed
him
as
he
drew
nearer
the
outlines
of
ricks
beside
it
,
lighted
up
to
great
distinctness
.
a
rick
-
yard
was
the
source
of
the
fire
.
his
weary
face
now
began
to
be
painted
over
with
a
rich
orange
glow
,
and
the
whole
front
of
his
smock
-
frock
and
gaiters
was
covered
with
a
dancing
shadow
pattern
of
thorn
-
twigs
the
light
reaching
him
through
a
leafless
intervening
hedge
and
the
metallic
curve
of
his
sheep
-
crook
shone
silver
-
bright
in
the
same
abounding
rays
.
he
came
up
to
the
boundary
fence
,
and
stood
to
regain
breath
.
it
seemed
as
if
the
spot
was
unoccupied
by
a
living
soul
.
the
fire
was
issuing
from
a
long
straw
-
stack
,
which
was
so
far
gone
as
to
preclude
a
possibility
of
saving
it
.
a
rick
burns
differently
from
a
house
.
as
the
wind
blows
the
fire
inwards
,
the
portion
in
flames
completely
disappears
like
melting
sugar
,
and
the
outline
is
lost
to
the
eye
.
however
,
a
hay
or
a
wheat
-
rick
,
well
put
together
,
will
resist
combustion
for
a
length
of
time
,
if
it
begins
on
the
outside
.
this
before
gabriel
'
s
eyes
was
a
rick
of
straw
,
loosely
put
together
,
and
the
flames
darted
into
it
with
lightning
swiftness
.
it
glowed
on
the
windward
side
,
rising
and
falling
in
intensity
,
like
the
coal
of
a
cigar
.
then
a
superincumbent
bundle
rolled
down
,
with
a
whisking
noise
;
flames
elongated
,
and
bent
themselves
about
with
a
quiet
roar
,
but
no
crackle
.
banks
of
smoke
went
off
horizontally
at
the
back
like
passing
clouds
,
and
behind
these
burned
hidden
pyres
,
illuminating
the
semi
-
transparent
sheet
of
smoke
to
a
lustrous
yellow
uniformity
.
individual
straws
in
the
foreground
were
consumed
in
a
creeping
movement
of
ruddy
heat
,
as
if
they
were
knots
of
red
worms
,
and
above
shone
imaginary
fiery
faces
,
tongues
hanging
from
lips
,
glaring
eyes
,
and
other
impish
forms
,
from
which
at
intervals
sparks
flew
in
clusters
like
birds
from
a
nest
,
oak
suddenly
ceased
from
being
a
mere
spectator
by
discovering
the
case
to
be
more
serious
than
he
had
at
first
imagined
.
