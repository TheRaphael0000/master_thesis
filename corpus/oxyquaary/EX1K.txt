it
was
about
half
-
past
three
when
i
came
forth
on
the
lang
dykes
.
dean
was
where
i
wanted
to
go
.
since
catriona
dwelled
there
,
and
her
kinsfolk
the
glengyle
macgregors
appeared
almost
certainly
to
be
employed
against
me
,
it
was
just
one
of
the
few
places
i
should
have
kept
away
from
;
and
being
a
very
young
man
,
and
beginning
to
be
very
much
in
love
,
i
turned
my
face
in
that
direction
without
pause
.
as
a
slave
to
my
conscience
and
common
sense
,
however
,
i
took
a
measure
of
precaution
.
coming
over
the
crown
of
a
bit
of
a
rise
in
the
road
,
i
clapped
down
suddenly
among
the
barley
and
lay
waiting
.
after
a
while
,
a
man
went
by
that
looked
to
be
a
highlandman
,
but
i
had
never
seen
him
till
that
hour
.
presently
after
came
neil
of
the
red
head
.
the
next
to
go
past
was
a
miller
'
s
cart
,
and
after
that
nothing
but
manifest
country
people
.
here
was
enough
to
have
turned
the
most
foolhardy
from
his
purpose
,
but
my
inclination
ran
too
strong
the
other
way
.
i
argued
it
out
that
if
neil
was
on
that
road
,
it
was
the
right
road
to
find
him
in
,
leading
direct
to
his
chief
'
s
daughter
;
as
for
the
other
highlandman
,
if
i
was
to
be
startled
off
by
every
highlandman
i
saw
,
i
would
scarce
reach
anywhere
.
and
having
quite
satisfied
myself
with
this
disingenuous
debate
,
i
made
the
better
speed
of
it
,
and
came
a
little
after
four
to
mrs
drumond
-
ogilvy
'
s
.
both
ladies
were
within
the
house
;
and
upon
my
perceiving
them
together
by
the
open
door
,
i
plucked
off
my
hat
and
said
,
"
here
was
a
lad
come
seeking
saxpence
,
"
which
i
thought
might
please
the
dowager
.
catriona
ran
out
to
greet
me
heartily
,
and
,
to
my
surprise
,
the
old
lady
seemed
scarce
less
forward
than
herself
.
i
learned
long
afterwards
that
she
had
despatched
a
horseman
by
daylight
to
rankeillor
at
the
queensferry
,
whom
she
knew
to
be
the
doer
for
shaws
,
and
had
then
in
her
pocket
a
letter
from
that
good
friend
of
mine
,
presenting
,
in
the
most
favourable
view
,
my
character
and
prospects
.
but
had
i
read
it
i
could
scarce
have
seen
more
clear
in
her
designs
.
maybe
i
was
countryfeed
;
at
least
,
i
was
not
so
much
so
as
she
thought
;
and
it
was
even
to
my
homespun
wits
,
that
she
was
bent
to
hammer
up
a
match
between
her
cousin
and
a
beardless
boy
that
was
something
of
a
laird
in
lothian
.
"
saxpence
had
better
take
his
broth
with
us
,
catrine
,
"
says
she
.
"
run
and
tell
the
lasses
.
"
and
for
the
little
while
we
were
alone
was
at
a
good
deal
of
pains
to
flatter
me
;
always
cleverly
,
always
with
the
appearance
of
a
banter
,
still
calling
me
saxpence
,
but
with
such
a
turn
that
should
rather
uplift
me
in
my
own
opinion
.
when
catriona
returned
,
the
design
became
if
possible
more
obvious
;
and
she
showed
off
the
girl
'
s
advantages
like
a
horse
-
couper
with
a
horse
.
my
face
flamed
that
she
should
think
me
so
obtuse
.
now
i
would
fancy
the
girl
was
being
innocently
made
a
show
of
,
and
then
i
could
have
beaten
the
old
carline
wife
with
a
cudgel
;
and
now
,
that
perhaps
these
two
had
set
their
heads
together
to
entrap
me
,
and
at
that
i
sat
and
gloomed
betwixt
them
like
the
very
image
of
ill
-
will
.
at
last
the
matchmaker
had
a
better
device
,
which
was
to
leave
the
pair
of
us
alone
.
when
my
suspicions
are
anyway
roused
it
is
sometimes
a
little
the
wrong
side
of
easy
to
allay
them
.
but
though
i
knew
what
breed
she
was
of
,
and
that
was
a
breed
of
thieves
,
i
could
never
look
in
catriona
'
s
face
and
disbelieve
her
.
"
i
must
not
ask
?
"
says
she
,
eagerly
,
the
same
moment
we
were
left
alone
.
"
ah
,
but
to
-
day
i
can
talk
with
a
free
conscience
,
"
i
replied
.
"
i
am
lightened
of
my
pledge
,
and
indeed
(
after
what
has
come
and
gone
since
morning
)
i
would
not
have
renewed
it
were
it
asked
.
"
"
tell
me
,
"
she
said
.
"
my
cousin
will
not
be
so
long
.
"
so
i
told
her
the
tale
of
the
lieutenant
from
the
first
step
to
the
last
of
it
,
making
it
as
mirthful
as
i
could
,
and
,
indeed
,
there
was
matter
of
mirth
in
that
absurdity
.
"
and
i
think
you
will
be
as
little
fitted
for
the
rudas
men
as
for
the
pretty
ladies
,
after
all
!
"
says
she
,
when
i
had
done
.
"
but
what
was
your
father
that
he
could
not
learn
you
to
draw
the
sword
!
it
is
most
ungentle
;
i
have
not
heard
the
match
of
that
in
anyone
.
"
"
it
is
most
misconvenient
at
least
,
"
said
i
;
"
and
i
think
my
father
(
honest
man
!
)
must
have
been
wool
-
gathering
to
learn
me
latin
in
the
place
of
it
.
but
you
see
i
do
the
best
i
can
,
and
just
stand
up
like
lot
'
s
wife
and
let
them
hammer
at
me
.
"
"
do
you
know
what
makes
me
smile
?
"
said
she
.
"
well
,
it
is
this
.
i
am
made
this
way
,
that
i
should
have
been
a
man
child
.
in
my
own
thoughts
it
is
so
i
am
always
;
and
i
go
on
telling
myself
about
this
thing
that
is
to
befall
and
that
.
then
it
comes
to
the
place
of
the
fighting
,
and
it
comes
over
me
that
i
am
only
a
girl
at
all
events
,
and
cannot
hold
a
sword
or
give
one
good
blow
;
and
then
i
have
to
twist
my
story
round
about
,
so
that
the
fighting
is
to
stop
,
and
yet
me
have
the
best
of
it
,
just
like
you
and
the
lieutenant
;
and
i
am
the
boy
that
makes
the
fine
speeches
all
through
,
like
mr
david
balfour
.
"
"
you
are
a
bloodthirsty
maid
,
"
said
i
.
"
well
,
i
know
it
is
good
to
sew
and
spin
,
and
to
make
samplers
,
"
she
said
,
"
but
if
you
were
to
do
nothing
else
in
the
great
world
,
i
think
you
will
say
yourself
it
is
a
driech
business
;
and
it
is
not
that
i
want
to
kill
,
i
think
.
did
ever
you
kill
anyone
?
"
"
that
i
have
,
as
it
chances
.
two
,
no
less
,
and
me
still
a
lad
that
should
be
at
the
college
,
"
said
i
.
"
but
yet
,
in
the
look
-
back
,
i
take
no
shame
for
it
.
"
"
but
how
did
you
feel
,
then
after
it
?
"
she
asked
.
'
"
deed
,
i
sat
down
and
grat
like
a
bairn
,
"
said
i
.
"
i
know
that
,
too
,
"
she
cried
.
"
i
feel
where
these
tears
should
come
from
.
and
at
any
rate
,
i
would
not
wish
to
kill
,
only
to
be
catherine
douglas
that
put
her
arm
through
the
staples
of
the
bolt
,
where
it
was
broken
.
that
is
my
chief
hero
.
would
you
not
love
to
die
so
.
for
your
king
?
"
she
asked
.
"
troth
,
"
said
i
,
"
my
affection
for
my
king
,
god
bless
the
puggy
face
of
him
,
is
under
more
control
;
and
i
thought
i
saw
death
so
near
to
me
this
day
already
,
that
i
am
rather
taken
up
with
the
notion
of
living
.
"
"
right
,
"
she
said
,
"
the
right
mind
of
a
man
!
only
you
must
learn
arms
;
i
would
not
like
to
have
a
friend
that
cannot
strike
.
but
it
will
not
have
been
with
the
sword
that
you
killed
these
two
?
"
"
indeed
,
no
,
"
said
i
,
"
but
with
a
pair
of
pistols
.
and
a
fortunate
thing
it
was
the
men
were
so
near
-
hand
to
me
,
for
i
am
about
as
clever
with
the
pistols
as
i
am
with
the
sword
.
"
so
then
she
drew
from
me
the
story
of
our
battle
in
the
brig
,
which
i
had
omitted
in
my
first
account
of
my
affairs

she
,

the
thought
of
him
,

that
it
was
within
my
choice
to
speak
with
him
that
night
,

almost
overcome
me
.
"
and
where
will
my
head
be
gone

"
she
cried
,
and
spoke
of
a
letter
from
her
father
,
bearing
that
she
might
visit
him
to

morrow
in
the
castle
whither
he
was
now
transferred
,
and
that
his
affairs
were
mending
.
"

not

she
.

you

an
ill

it
still
.
ah
,
if
you
could
talk
that
language
you
would
find
me
another
girl
.
the
heart
speaks
in
that
tongue
.
"
i
had
a
meal
with
the
two
ladies
,
all
very
good
,
served
in
fine
old
plate
,
and
the
wine
excellent
,
for
it
seems
that
mrs
ogilvy
was
rich
.
our
talk
,
too
,
was
pleasant
enough
;
but
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
sun
decline
sharply
and
the
shadows
to
run
out
long
,
i
rose
to
take
my
leave
.
for
my
mind
was
now
made
up
to
say
farewell
to
alan
;
and
it
was
needful
i
should
see
the
trysting
wood
,
and
reconnoitre
it
,
by
daylight
.
catriona
came
with
me
as
far
as
to
the
garden
gate
.
"
it
is
long
till
i
see
you
now
?
"
she
asked
.
"
it
is
beyond
my
judging
,
"
i
replied
.
"
it
will
be
long
,
it
may
be
never
.
"
"
it
may
be
so
,
"
said
she
.
"
and
you
are
sorry
?
"
i
bowed
my
head
,
looking
upon
her
.
"
so
am
i
,
at
all
events
,
"
said
she
.
"
i
have
seen
you
but
a
small
time
,
but
i
put
you
very
high
.
you
are
true
,
you
are
brave
;
in
time
i
think
you
will
be
more
of
a
man
yet
.
i
will
be
proud
to
hear
of
that
.
if
you
should
speed
worse
,
if
it
will
come
to
fall
as
we
are
afraid
-
o
well
!
think
you
have
the
one
friend
.
long
after
you
are
dead
and
me
an
old
wife
,
i
will
be
telling
the
bairns
about
david
balfour
,
and
my
tears
running
.
i
will
be
telling
how
we
parted
,
and
what
i
said
to
you
,
and
did
to
you
.
god
go
with
you
and
guide
you
,
prays
your
little
friend
:
so
i
said
.
i
will
be
telling
them
.
and
here
is
what
i
did
.
"
she
took
up
my
hand
and
kissed
it
.
this
so
surprised
my
spirits
that
i
cried
out
like
one
hurt
.
the
colour
came
strong
in
her
face
,
and
she
looked
at
me
and
nodded
.
"
o
yes
,
mr
david
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
is
what
i
think
of
you
.
the
head
goes
with
the
lips
.
"
i
could
read
in
her
face
high
spirit
,
and
a
chivalry
like
a
brave
child
'
s
;
not
anything
besides
.
she
kissed
my
hand
,
as
she
had
kissed
prince
charlie
'
s
,
with
a
higher
passion
than
the
common
kind
of
clay
has
any
sense
of
.
nothing
before
had
taught
me
how
deep
i
was
her
lover
,
nor
how
far
i
had
yet
to
climb
to
make
her
think
of
me
in
such
a
character
.
yet
i
could
tell
myself
i
had
advanced
some
way
,
and
that
her
heart
had
beat
and
her
blood
flowed
at
thoughts
of
me
.
after
that
honour
she
had
done
me
i
could
offer
no
more
trivial
civility
.
it
was
even
hard
for
me
to
speak
;
a
certain
lifting
in
her
voice
had
knocked
directly
at
the
door
of
my
own
tears
.
"
i
praise
god
for
your
kindness
,
dear
,
"
said
i
.
"
farewell
,
my
little
friend
!
"
giving
her
that
name
which
she
had
given
to
herself
;
with
which
i
bowed
and
left
her
.
my
way
was
down
the
glen
of
the
leith
river
,
towards
stockbridge
and
silvermills
.
a
path
led
in
the
foot
of
it
,
the
water
bickered
and
sang
in
the
midst
;
the
sunbeams
overhead
struck
out
of
the
west
among
long
shadows
and
(
as
the
valley
turned
)
made
like
a
new
scene
and
a
new
world
of
it
at
every
corner
.
with
catriona
behind
and
alan
before
me
,
i
was
like
one
lifted
up
.
the
place
besides
,
and
the
hour
,
and
the
talking
of
the
water
,
infinitely
pleased
me
;
and
i
lingered
in
my
steps
and
looked
before
and
behind
me
as
i
went
.
this
was
the
cause
,
under
providence
,
that
i
spied
a
little
in
my
rear
a
red
head
among
some
bushes
.
anger
sprang
in
my
heart
,
and
i
turned
straight
about
and
walked
at
a
stiff
pace
to
where
i
came
from
.
the
path
lay
close
by
the
bushes
where
i
had
remarked
the
head
.
the
cover
came
to
the
wayside
,
and
as
i
passed
i
was
all
strung
up
to
meet
and
to
resist
an
onfall
.
no
such
thing
befell
,
i
went
by
unmeddled
with
;
and
at
that
fear
increased
upon
me
.
it
was
still
day
indeed
,
but
the
place
exceeding
solitary
.
if
my
haunters
had
let
slip
that
fair
occasion
i
could
but
judge
they
aimed
at
something
more
than
david
balfour
.
the
lives
of
alan
and
james
weighed
upon
my
spirit
with
the
weight
of
two
grown
bullocks
.
catriona
was
yet
in
the
garden
walking
by
herself
.
"
catriona
,
"
said
i
,
"
you
see
me
back
again
.
"
"
with
a
changed
face
,
"
said
she
.
"
i
carry
two
men
'
s
lives
besides
my
own
,
"
said
i
.
"
it
would
be
a
sin
and
shame
not
to
walk
carefully
.
i
was
doubtful
whether
i
did
right
to
come
here
.
i
would
like
it
ill
,
if
it
was
by
that
means
we
were
brought
to
harm
.
"
"
i
could
tell
you
one
that
would
be
liking
it
less
,
and
will
like
little
enough
to
hear
you
talking
at
this
very
same
time
,
"
she
cried
.
"
what
have
i
done
,
at
all
events
?
"
"
o
,
you
i
you
are
not
alone
,
"
i
replied
.
"
but
since
i
went
off
i
have
been
dogged
again
,
and
i
can
give
you
the
name
of
him
that
follows
me
.

she
said
,
with
a
white
face
.
"

edinburgh

errands
from
my

fear

said
i
,
"
the
last
of
it
.
but
for
his
being
in
edinburgh
i
think
i
can
show
you
another
of
that
.
for
sure
you
have
some
signal
,
a
signal
of
need
,
such
as
would
bring
him
to
your
help
,

he
was
anywhere
within
the
reach
of
ears

legs

"
"
why
,
how
will
you
know
that
?
"
says
she
.
"
by
means
of
a
magical
talisman
god
gave
to
me
when
i
was
born
,

the
name
they
call
it
by
is
common

said
i
.
"
oblige
me
so
far
as
make
your
signal

and
i
will
show
you
the
red
head
of
neil
.
"
no
doubt
but
i
spoke
bitter
and
sharp
.
my
heart
was
bitter
.
i
blamed
myself
and
the
girl
and
hated
both
of
us
:
her
for
the
vile
crew
that
she
was
come
of
,
myself
for
my
wanton
folly
to
have
stuck
my
head
in
such
a
byke
of
wasps
.
catriona
set
her
fingers
to
her
lips
and
whistled
once
,
with
an
exceeding
clear
,
strong
,
mounting
note
,
as
full
as
a
ploughman
'
s
.
a
while
we
stood
silent
;
and
i
was
about
to
ask
her
to
repeat
the
same
,
when
i
heard
the
sound
of
some
one
bursting
through
the
bushes
below
on
the
braeside
.
i
pointed
in
that
direction
with
a
smile
,
and
presently
neil
leaped
into
the
garden
.
his
eyes
burned
,
and
he
had
a
black
knife
(
as
they
call
it
on
the
highland
side
)
naked
in
his
hand
;
but
,
seeing
me
beside
his
mistress
,
stood
like
a
man
struck
.
"
he
has
come
to
your
call
,
"
said
i
;
"
judge
how
near
he
was
to
edinburgh
,
or
what
was
the
nature
of
your
father
'
s
errands
.
ask
himself
.
if
i
am
to
lose
my
life
,

the
lives
of
those
that
hang
by
me

the

me
go
where
i

to
go
with
my

open

"
she
addressed
him
tremulously
in
the
gaelic
.
remembering
alan
'
s
anxious
civility
in
that
particular
,
i
could
have
laughed
out
loud
for
bitterness
;
here
,
sure
,
in
the
midst
of
these
suspicions
,
was
the
hour
she
should
have
stuck
by
english
.
twice
or
thrice
they
spoke
together
,
and
i
could
make
out
that
neil
(
for
all
his
obsequiousness
)
was
an
angry
man
.
then
she
turned
to
me
.

she

cried

once
more

gaelic

never
anything

gazing
at

with
the

white
face

burst
out
weeping

smote

hard

brae
,
with
the
mill
-
lade
flowing
swift
and
deep
along
the
foot
of
it
;
and
here
i
began
to
walk
slower
and
to
reflect
more
reasonably
on
my
employment
.
i
saw
i
had
made
but
a
fool
'
s
bargain
with
catriona
.
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
neil
was
sent
alone
upon
his
errand
,
but
perhaps
he
was
the
only
man
belonging
to
james
more
;
in
which
case
i
should
have
done
all
i
could
to
hang
catriona
'
s
father
,
and
nothing
the
least
material
to
help
myself
.
to
tell
the
truth
,
i
fancied
neither
one
of
these
ideas
.
suppose
by
holding
back
neil
,
the
girl
should
have
helped
to
hang
her
father
,
i
thought
she
would
never
forgive
herself
this
side
of
time
.
and
suppose
there
were
others
pursuing
me
that
moment
,
what
kind
of
a
gift
was
i
come
bringing
to
alan
?
and
how
would
i
like
that
?
i
was
up
with
the
west
end
of
that
wood
when
these
two
considerations
struck
me
like
a
cudgel
.
my
feet
stopped
of
themselves
and
my
heart
along
with
them
.
"
what
wild
game
is
this
that
i
have
been
playing
?
"
thought
i
;
and
turned
instantly
upon
my
heels
to
go
elsewhere
.
this
brought
my
face
to
silvermills
;
the
path
came
past
the
village
with
a
crook
,
but
all
plainly
visible
;
and
,
highland
or
lowland
,
there
was
nobody
stirring
.
here
was
my
advantage
,
here
was
just
such
a
conjuncture
as
stewart
had
counselled
me
to
profit
by
,
and
i
ran
by
the
side
of
the
mill
-
lade
,
fetched
about
beyond
the
east
corner
of
the
wood
,
threaded
through
the
midst
of
it
,
and
returned
to
the
west
selvage
,
whence
i
could
again
command
the
path
,
and
yet
be
myself
unseen
.
again
it
was
all
empty
,
and
my
heart
began
to
rise
.
for
more
than
an
hour
i
sat
close
in
the
border
of
the
trees
,
and
no
hare
or
eagle
could
have
kept
a
more
particular
watch
.
when
that
hour
began
the
sun
was
already
set
,
but
the
sky
still
all
golden
and
the
daylight
clear
;
before
the
hour
was
done
it
had
fallen
to
be
half
mirk
,
the
images
and
distances
of
things
were
mingled
,
and
observation
began
to
be
difficult
.
all
that
time
not
a
foot
of
man
had
come
east
from
silvermills
,
and
the
few
that
had
gone
west
were
honest
countryfolk
and
their
wives
upon
the
road
to
bed
.
if
i
were
tracked
by
the
most
cunning
spies
in
europe
,
i
judged
it
was
beyond
the
course
of
nature
they
could
have
any
jealousy
of
where
i
was
:
and
going
a
little
further
home
into
the
wood
i
lay
down
to
wait
for
alan
.
the
strain
of
my
attention
had
been
great
,
for
i
had
watched
not
the
path
only
,
but
every
bush
and
field
within
my
vision
.
that
was
now
at
an
end
.
the
moon
,
which
was
in
her
first
quarter
,
glinted
a
little
in
the
wood
;
all
round
there
was
a
stillness
of
the
country
;
and
as
i
lay
there
on
my
back
,
the
next
three
or
four
hours
,
i
had
a
fine
occasion
to
review
my
conduct
.
two
things
became
plain
to
me
first
:
that
i
had
no
right
to
go
that
day
to
dean
,
and
(
having
gone
there
)
had
now
no
right
to
be
lying
where
i
was
.
this
(
where
alan
was
to
come
)
was
just
the
one
wood
in
all
broad
scotland
that
was
,
by
every
proper
feeling
,
closed
against
me
;
i
admitted
that
,
and
yet
stayed
on
,
wondering
at
myself
.
i
thought
of
the
measure
with
which
i
had
meted
to
catriona
that
same
night
;
how
i
had
prated
of
the
two
lives
i
carried
,
and
had
thus
forced
her
to
enjeopardy
her
father
'
s
;
and
how
i
was
here
exposing
them
again
,
it
seemed
in
wantonness
.
a
good
conscience
is
eight
parts
of
courage
.
no
sooner
had
i
lost
conceit
of
my
behaviour
,
than
i
seemed
to
stand
disarmed
amidst
a
throng
of
terrors
.
of
a
sudden
i
sat
up
.
how
if
i
went
now
to
prestongrange
,
caught
him
(
as
i
still
easily
might
)
before
he
slept
,
and
made
a
full
submission
?
who
could
blame
me
?
not
stewart
the
writer
;
i
had
but
to
say
that
i
was
followed
,
despaired
of
getting
clear
,
and
so
gave
in
.
not
catriona
:
here
,
too
,
i
had
my
answer
ready
;
that
i
could
not
bear
she
should
expose
her
father
.
so
,
in
a
moment
,
i
could
lay
all
these
troubles
by
,
which
were
after
all
and
truly
none
of
mine
;
swim
clear
of
the
appin
murder
;
get
forth
out
of
hand
-
stroke
of
all
the
stewarts
and
campbells
,
all
the
whigs
and
tories
,
in
the
land
;
and
live
henceforth
to
my
own
mind
,
and
be
able
to
enjoy
and
to
improve
my
fortunes
,
and
devote
some
hours
of
my
youth
to
courting
catriona
,
which
would
be
surely
a
more
suitable
occupation
than
to
hide
and
run
and
be
followed
like
a
hunted
thief
,
and
begin
over
again
the
dreadful
miseries
of
my
escape
with
alan
.
at
first
i
thought
no
shame
of
this
capitulation
;
i
was
only
amazed
i
had
not
thought
upon
the
thing
and
done
it
earlier
;
and
began
to
inquire
into
the
causes
of
the
change
.
these
i
traced
to
my
lowness
of
spirits
,
that
back
to
my
late
recklessness
,
and
that
again
to
the
common
,
old
,
public
,
disconsidered
sin
of
self
-
indulgence
.
instantly
the
text
came
in
my
head
,
"
how
can
satan
cast
out
satan
?
"
what
?
(
i
thought
)
i
had
,
by
self
-
indulgence
;
and
the
following
of
pleasant
paths
,
and
the
lure
of
a
young
maid
,
cast
myself
wholly
out
of
conceit
with
my
own
character
,
and
jeopardised
the
lives
of
james
and
alan
?
and
i
was
to
seek
the
way
out
by
the
same
road
as
i
had
entered
in
?
no
;
the
hurt
that
had
been
caused
by
self
-
indulgence
must
be
cured
by
self
-
denial
;
the
flesh
i
had
pampered
must
be
crucified
.
i
looked
about
me
for
that
course
which
i
least
liked
to
follow
:
this
was
to
leave
the
wood
without
waiting
to
see
alan
,
and
go
forth
again
alone
,
in
the
dark
and
in
the
midst
of
my
perplexed
and
dangerous
fortunes
.
i
have
been
the
more
careful
to
narrate
this
passage
of
my
reflections
,
because
i
think
it
is
of
some
utility
,
and
may
serve
as
an
example
to
young
men
.
but
there
is
reason
(
they
say
)
in
planting
kale
,
and
even
in
ethic
and
religion
,
room
for
common
sense
.
it
was
already
close
on
alan
'
s
hour
,
and
the
moon
was
down
.
if
i
left
(
as
i
could
not
very
decently
whistle
to
my
spies
to
follow
me
)
they
might
miss
me
in
the
dark
and
tack
themselves
to
alan
by
mistake
.
if
i
stayed
,
i
could
at
the
least
of
it
set
my
friend
upon
his
guard
which
might
prove
his
mere
salvation
.
i
had
adventured
other
peoples
'
safety
in
a
course
of
self
-
indulgence
;
to
have
endangered
them
again
,
and
now
on
a
mere
design
of
penance
,
would
have
been
scarce
rational
.
accordingly
,
i
had
scarce
risen
from
my
place
ere
i
sat
down
again
,
but
already
in
a
different
frame
of
spirits
,
and
equally
marvelling
at
my
past
weakness
and
rejoicing
in
my
present
composure
.
presently
after
came
a
crackling
in
the
thicket
.
putting
my
mouth
near
down
to
the
ground
,
i
whistled
a
note
or
two
,
of
alan
'
s
air
;
an
answer
came
in
the
like
guarded
tone
,
and
soon
we
had
knocked
together
in
the
dark
.
"
is
this
you
at
last
,
davie
?
"
he
whispered
.
"
just
myself
,
"
said
i
.
"
god
,
man
,
but
i
'
ve
been
wearying
to
see
ye
!
"
says
he
.
"
i
'
ve
had
the
longest
kind
of
a
time
.
a
'
day
,
i
'
ve
had
my
dwelling
into
the
inside
of
a
stack
of
hay
,
where
i
couldnae
see
the
nebs
of
my
ten
fingers
;
and
then
two
hours
of
it
waiting
here
for
you
,
and
you
never
coming
!
dod
,
and
ye
are
none
too
soon
the
way
it
is
,
with
me
to
sail
the
morn

the
morn

what
am
i
saying
?
-
the
day

mean
.
"
"
ay

enough

said
i
.
"
it
is
past
twelve
now
,
surely
,
and
ye
sail
the
day
.
this
will
be
a
long
road
you
have
before
you
.
"
"
we
will
have
a
long
crack
of
it

said
he
.
"

i
have
a
good
deal
it
will
be
telling
you

"
said
i
.
and
i
told
him
what
behooved
,
making
rather
a
jumble
of
it
,
but
clear
enough
when
done
.
he
heard
me
out
with
very
few
questions
,
laughing
here
and
there
like
a
man
delighted
:
and
the
sound
of
his
laughing
(
above
all
there
,
in
the
dark
,
where
neither
one
of
us
could
see
the
other
)
was
extraordinary
friendly
to
my
heart
.
"
ay
,
davie
,
ye
are
a
queer
character
,
"
says
he
,
when
i
had
done
:
"
a
queer
bitch

'
,

i
have
no

it
was
no
use

i
gave
a
little
crack
of
laughter

"

i

your

drive

the

it

your

i

the

this

ye

,
david
man

they
will
be
hieland
folk
.
there
will
be
some
frasers
,
i
am
thinking
,
and
some
of
the
gregara
;
and
i
would
never
deny
but
what
the
both
of
them
,
and
the
gregara
in
especial
,
were
clever
experienced
persons
.
a
man
kens
little
till
he
is
driven
a
spreagh
of
neat
cattle
(
say
)
ten
miles
through
a
throng
lowland
country
and
the
black
soldiers
maybe
at
his
tail
.
it
is
there
that
i
learned
a
great
part
of
my
penetration
.
and
ye
need
nae
tell
me
:
it
is
better
than
war
;
which
is
the
next
best
,
however
,
though
generally
rather
a
bauchle
of
a
business
.
now
the
gregara
have
had
grand
practice
.
"
"
no
doubt
that
'
s
a
branch
of
education
that
was
left
out
with
me
,
"
said
i
.
"
and
i
can
see
the
marks
of
it
upon
ye
constantly
,
"
said
alan
.
"
but
that
'
s
the
strange
thing
about
you
folk
of
the
college
learning
:
ye
are
ignorat
,

ye
cannae

there
'

the
differ
of

now

here
'

you

ye
lie
on
your
wame
a
bittie
in
the
bield
of
this
wood
,
and
ye
tell
me
that
ye
'
ve
cuist
off
these
frasers
and
macgregors
.
why
?
because
i
couldnae
see
them
,
says
you
.
ye
blockhead
,
that
'
s
their
livelihood
.
"
"
take
the
worst
of
it
,
"
said
i
,
"
and
what
are
we
to
do
?
"
"
i
am
thinking
of
that
same
,
"
said
he
.
"
we
might
twine
.
it
wouldnae
be
greatly
to
my
taste
;
and
forbye
that
,
i
see
reasons
against
it
.
first
,
it
is
now
unco
dark
,
and
it
is
just
humanly
possible
we
might
give
them
the
clean
slip
.
if
we
keep
together
,
we
make
but
the
ae
line
of
it
;
if
we
gang
separate
,
we
make
twae
of
them
:
the
more
likelihood
to
stave
in
upon
some
of
these
gentry
of
yours
.
and
then
,
second
,
if
they
keep
the
track
of
us
,
it
may
come
to
a
fecht
for
it
yet
,
davie
;
and
then
,
i
will
confess
i
would
be
blythe
to
have
you
at
my
oxter
,
and
i
think
you
would
be
none
the
worse
of
having
me
at
yours
.
so
,
by
my
way
of
it
,
we
should
creep
out
of
this
wood
no
further
gone
than
just
the
inside
of
next
minute
,
and
hold
away
east
for
gillane
,
where
i
am
to
find
my
ship
.
it
will
be
like
old
days
while
it
lasts
,
davie
;
and
(
come
the
time
)
we
will
have
to
think
what
you
should
be
doing
.
i
am
wae
to
leave
ye
here
,
wanting
me

"
"
deil
a
fear

"
said
alan
.
"
they
were
good
folks
to
me
,
but
i
think
they
would
be
a
good
deal
disappointed
if
they
saw
my
bonny
face
again
.
for
(
the
way
times
go
)
i
amnae
just
what
ye
could
call
a
walcome
guest
.
which
makes
me
the
keener
for
your
company
,
mr
david
balfour
of
the
shaws
,
and
set
ye
up
!
for
,
leave
aside
twa
cracks
here
in
the
wood
with
charlie
stewart
,
i
have
scarce
said
black
or
white
since
the
day
we
parted
at
corstorphine
.
"
with
which
he
rose
from
his
place
,
and
we
began
to
move
quietly
eastward
through
the
wood
.
it
was
likely
between
one
and
two
;
the
moon
(
as
i
have
said
)
was
down
;
a
strongish
wind
,
carrying
a
heavy
wrack
of
cloud
,
had
set
in
suddenly
from
the
west
;
and
we
began
our
movement
in
as
black
a
night
as
ever
a
fugitive
or
a
murderer
wanted
.
the
whiteness
of
the
path
guided
us
into
the
sleeping
town
of
broughton
,
thence
through
picardy
,
and
beside
my
old
acquaintance
the
gibbet
of
the
two
thieves
.
a
little
beyond
we
made
a
useful
beacon
,
which
was
a
light
in
an
upper
window
of
lochend
.
steering
by
this
,
but
a
good
deal
at
random
,
and
with
some
trampling
of
the
harvest
,
and
stumbling
and
falling
down
upon
the
banks
,
we
made
our
way
across
country
,
and
won
forth
at
last
upon
the
linky
,
boggy
muirland
that
they
call
the
figgate
whins
.
here
,
under
a
bush
of
whin
,
we
lay
down
the
remainder
of
that
night
and
slumbered
.
the
day
called
us
about
five
.
a
beautiful
morning
it
was
,
the
high
westerly
wind
still
blowing
strong
,
but
the
clouds
all
blown
away
to
europe
.
alan
was
already
sitting
up
and
smiling
to
himself
.
it
was
my
first
sight
of
my
friend
since
we
were
parted
,
and
i
looked
upon
him
with
enjoyment
.
he
had
still
the
same
big
great
-
coat
on
his
back
;
but
(
what
was
new
)
he
had
now
a
pair
of
knitted
boot
-
hose
drawn
above
the
knee
.
doubtless
these
were
intended
for
disguise
;
but
,
as
the
day
promised
to
be
warm
,
he
made
a
most
unseasonable
figure
.
"
well
,
davie
,
"
said
he
,
"
is
this
no
a
bonny
morning
?
here
is
a
day
that
looks
the
way
that
a
day
ought
to
.
this
is
a
great
change
of
it
from
the
belly
of
my
haystack
;
and
while
you
were
there
sottering
and
sleeping
i
have
done
a
thing
that
maybe
i
do
very
seldom
.
"
"
and
what
was
that
?
"
said
i
.
"
o
,
just
said
my
prayers
,
"
said
he
.
"
and
where
are
my
gentry
,
as
ye
call
them
?
"
i
asked
.
"
gude
kens
,
"
says
he
;
"
and
the
short
and
the
long
of
it
is
that
we
must
take
our
chance
of
them
.
up
with
your
foot
-
soles
,
davie

forth
,
fortune
,
once
again
of
it
!
and
a
bonny
walk
we
are
like
to
have
.
"
so
we
went
east
by
the
beach
of
the
sea
,
towards
where
the
salt
-
pans
were
smoking
in
by
the
esk
mouth
.
no
doubt
there
was
a
by

ordinary
bonny
blink
of
morning
sun
on
arthur
'

seat

the
green
pentlands

the
pleasantness

nettles

lang

just
about

make

i
had
a

i
played
some

more

extraordinary

the

take
long

it
might
take
short

it

get

"
we
had
a
haddock
to
our
breakfast
in
musselburgh
,
where
it
amused
me
vastly
to
hear
alan
.
his
great
-
coat
and
boot
-
hose
were
extremely
remarkable
this
warm
morning
,
and
perhaps
some
hint
of
an
explanation
had
been
wise
;
but
alan
went
into
that
matter
like
a
business
,
or
i
should
rather
say
,
like
a
diversion
.
he
engaged
the
goodwife
of
the
house
with
some
compliments
upon
the
rizzoring
of
our
haddocks
;
and
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
our
stay
held
her
in
talk
about
a
cold
he
had
taken
on
his
stomach
,
gravely
relating
all
manner
of
symptoms
and
sufferings
,
and
hearing
with
a
vast
show
of
interest
all
the
old
wives
'
remedies
she
could
supply
him
with
in
return
.
we
left
musselburgh
before
the
first
ninepenny
coach
was
due
from
edinburgh
for
(
as
alan
said
)
that
was
a
rencounter
we
might
very
well
avoid
.
the
wind
although
still
high
,
was
very
mild
,
the
sun
shone
strong
,
and
alan
began
to
suffer
in
proportion
.
from
prestonpans
he
had
me
aside
to
the
field
of
gladsmuir
,
where
he
exerted
himself
a
great
deal
more
than
needful
to
describe
the
stages
of
the
battle
.
thence
,
at
his
old
round
pace
,
we
travelled
to
cockenzie
.
though
they
were
building
herring
-
busses
there
at
mrs
cadell
'
s
,
it
seemed
a
desert
-
like
,
back
-
going
town
,
about
half
full
of
ruined
houses
;
but
the
ale
-
house
was
clean
,
and
alan
,
who
was
now
in
a
glowing
heat
,
must
indulge
himself
with
a
bottle
of
ale
,
and
carry
on
to
the
new
luckie
with
the
old
story
of
the
cold
upon
his
stomach
,
only
now
the
symptoms
were
all
different
.
i
sat
listening
;
and
it
came
in
my
mind
that
i
had
scarce
ever
heard
him
address
three
serious
words
to
any
woman
,
but
he
was
always
drolling
and
fleering
and
making
a
private
mock
of
them
,
and
yet
brought
to
that
business
a
remarkable
degree
of
energy
and
interest
.
something
to
this
effect
i
remarked
to
him
,
when
the
good
-
wife
(
as
chanced
)
was
called
away
.
"
what
do
ye
want
?
"
says
he
.
"
a
man
should
aye
put
his
best
foot
forrit
with
the
womankind
;
he
should
aye
give
them
a
bit
of
a
story
to
divert
them
,
the
poor
lambs
!
it
is
what
ye
should
learn
to
attend
to
,
david
;
ye
should
get
the
principles
,
it
is
like
a
trade
.
now
,
if
this
had
been
a
young
lassie
,
or
onyways
bonnie
,
she
would
never
have
heard
tell
of
my
stomach
,
davie
.
but
aince
they
are
too
old
to
be
seeking
joes
,
they
a
'
set
up
to
be
apotecaries
.
why
?
what
do
i
ken
?
they
will
be
just
the
way
god
made
them
,
i
suppose
.
but
i
think
a
man
would
be
a
gomeral
that
didnae
give
his
attention
to
the
same
.
"
and
here
,
the
luckie
coming
back
,
he
turned
from
me
as
if
with
impatience
to
renew
their
former
conversation
.
the
lady
had
branched
some
while
before
from
alan
'
s
stomach
to
the
case
of
a
goodbrother
of
her
own
in
aberlady
,
whose
last
sickness
and
demise
she
was
describing
at
extraordinary
length
.
sometimes
it
was
merely
dull
,
sometimes
both
dull
and
awful
,
for
she
talked
with
unction
.
the
upshot
was
that
i
fell
in
a
deep
muse
,
looking
forth
of
the
window
on
the
road
,
and
scarce
marking
what
i
saw
.
presently
had
any
been
looking
they
might
have
seen
me
to
start
.
"
we
pit
a
fomentation

good

he

done
by
his
marchings
under
general
cope
;
for
i
can
scarce
tell
what
way
we
went
.
it
is
my
excuse
that
we
travelled
exceeding
fast
.
some
part
we
ran
,
some
trotted
,
and
the
rest
walked
at
a
vengeance
of
a
pace
.
twice
,
while
we
were
at
top
speed
,
we
ran
against
country
-
folk
;
but
though
we
plumped
into
the
first
from
round
a
corner
,
alan
was
as
ready
as
a
loaded
musket

he

.
"
na

replied
the
countryman
.
and
alan
spared
the
time
to
explain
to
him
that
we
were
travelling
"
ride
and
tie
"
;
that
our
charger
had
escaped
,
and
it
was
feared
he
had
gone
home
to
linton
.
not
only
that
,
but
he
expended
some
breath
(
of
which
he
had
not
very
much
left
)
to
curse
his
own
misfortune
and
my
stupidity
which
was
said
to
be
its
cause
.
"
them
that
cannae
tell
the
truth
,
"
he
observed
to
myself
as
we
went
on
again
,
"
should
be
aye
mindful
to
leave
an
honest
,
handy
lee
behind

if
folk
dinnae
ken
what
ye
are
doing
,
davie
,
they
are
terrible
taken
up
with
it
;
but
if
they
think
they
ken
,
they
care
nae
mair
for
it
than
what
i
do
for
pease
porridge
.
"
as
we
had
first
made
inland
,
so
our
road
came
in
the
end
to
lie
very
near
due
north
;
the
old
kirk
of
aberlady
for
a
landmark
on
the
left
;
on
the
right
,
the
top
of
the
berwick
law
;
and
it
was
thus
we
struck
the
shore
again
,
not
far
from
dirleton
.
from
north
berwick
west
to
gillane
ness
there
runs
a
string
of
four
small
islets
,
craiglieth
,
the
lamb
,
fidra
,
and
eyebrough
,
notable
by
their
diversity
of
size
and
shape
.
fidra
is
the
most
particular
,
being
a
strange
grey
islet
of
two
humps
,
made
the
more
conspicuous
by
a
piece
of
ruin
;
and
i
mind
that
(
as
we
drew
closer
to
it
)
by
some
door
or
window
of
these
ruins
the
sea
peeped
through
like
a
man
'
s
eye
.
under
the
lee
of
fidra
there
is
a
good
anchorage
in
westerly
winds
,
and
there
,
from
a
far
way
off
,
we
could
see
the
thistle
riding
.
the
shore
in
face
of
these
islets
is
altogether
waste
.
here
is
no
dwelling
of
man
,
and
scarce
any
passage
,
or
at
most
of
vagabond
children
running
at
their
play
.
gillane
is
a
small
place
on
the
far
side
of
the
ness
,
the
folk
of
dirleton
go
to
their
business
in
the
inland
fields
,
and
those
of
north
berwick
straight
to
the
sea
-
fishing
from
their
haven
;
so
that
few
parts
of
the
coast
are
lonelier
.
but
i
mind
,
as
we
crawled
upon
our
bellies
into
that
multiplicity
of
heights
and
hollows
,
keeping
a
bright
eye
upon
all
sides
,
and
our
hearts
hammering
at
our
ribs
,
there
was
such
a
shining
of
the
sun
and
the
sea
,
such
a
stir
of
the
wind
in
the
bent
grass
,
and
such
a
bustle
of
down
-
popping
rabbits
and
up
-
flying
gulls
,
that
the
desert
seemed
to
me
,
like
a
place
alive
.
no
doubt
it
was
in
all
ways
well
chosen
for
a
secret
embarcation
,
if
the
secret
had
been
kept
;
and
even
now
that
it
was
out
,
and
the
place
watched
,
we
were
able
to
creep
unperceived
to
the
front
of
the
sandhills
,
where
they
look
down
immediately
on
the
beach
and
sea
.
but
here
alan
came
to
a
full
stop
.
"

said
he
,
"

passage

i

nearer

.

as
soon
as
we
stand
up
and

the
brig

it
is
another
matter

will
be
all
arranged

'

"
and
then
of
a
sudden
he
stood
straight
up
where
he
was
,
and
with
a
handkerchief
flying
in
his
right
hand
,
marched
down
upon
the
beach
.
i
stood
up
myself
,
but
lingered
behind
him
,
scanning
the
sand
-
hills
to
the
east
.
his
appearance
was
at
first
unremarked
:
scougal
not
expecting
him
so
early
,
and
my
gentry
watching
on
the
other
side
.
then
they
awoke
on
board
the
thistle
,
and
it
seemed
they
had
all
in
readiness
,
for
there
was
scarce
a
second
'
s
bustle
on
the
deck
before
we
saw
a
skiff
put
round
her
stern
and
begin
to
pull
lively
for
the
coast
.
almost
at
the
same
moment
of
time
,
and
perhaps
half
a
mile
away
towards
gillane
ness
,
the
figure
of
a
man
appeared
for
a
blink
upon
a
sandhill
,
waving
with
his
arms
;
and
though
he
was
gone
again
in
the
same
flash
,
the
gulls
in
that
part
continued
a
little
longer
to
fly
wild
.
alan
had
not
seen
this
,
looking
straight
to
seaward
at
the
ship
and
skiff
.
"
it
maun
be
as
it
will

"
said
he
,
when
i
had
told
him
,
"

"
that
part
of
the
beach
was
long
and
flat
,
and
excellent
walking
when
the
tide
was
down
;
a
little
cressy
burn
flowed
over
it
in
one
place
to
the
sea
;
and
the
sandhills
ran
along
the
head
of
it
like
the
rampart
of
a
town
.
no
eye
of
ours
could
spy
what
was
passing
behind
there
in
the
bents
,
no
hurry
of
ours
could
mend
the
speed
of
the
boat
'
s
coming

time
stood
still
with
us
through
that
uncanny
period
of
waiting

sandy
bank

and
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
whistled
to
it
like
a
dog
.
it
was
now
perhaps
a
third
of
the
way
in
,
and
we
ourselves
already
hard
on
the
margin
of
the
sea
,
so
that
the
soft
sand
rose
over
my
shoes

no
more

do
whatever
