we
now
turned
into
a
pleasant
lane
where
the
branches
of
great
plane
-
trees
nearly
met
overhead
,
but
behind
them
lay
low
houses
standing
rather
close
together
.
"
this
is
long
acre
,
"
quoth
dick
;
"
so
there
must
once
have
been
a
cornfield
here
.
how
curious
it
is
that
places
change
so
,
and
yet
keep
their
old
names
!
just
look
how
thick
the
houses
stand
!
and
they
are
still
going
on
building
,
look
you
!
"
"
yes
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
but
i
think
the
cornfields
must
have
been
built
over
before
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
.
i
have
heard
that
about
here
was
one
of
the
thickest
parts
of
the
town
.
but
i
must
get
down
here
,
neighbours
;
i
have
got
to
call
on
a
friend
who
lives
in
the
gardens
behind
this
long
acre
.
good
-
bye
and
good
luck
,
guest
!
"
and
he
jumped
down
and
strode
away
vigorously
,
like
a
young
man
.
"
how
old
should
you
say
that
neighbour
will
be
?
"
said
i
to
dick
as
we
lost
sight
of
him
;
for
i
saw
that
he
was
old
,
and
yet
he
looked
dry
and
sturdy
like
a
piece
of
old
oak
;
a
type
of
old
man
i
was
not
used
to
seeing
.
"
o
,
about
ninety
,
i
should
say
,
"
said
dick
.
"
how
long
-
lived
your
people
must
be
!
"
said
i
.
"
yes
,
"
said
dick
,
"
certainly
we
have
beaten
the
threescore
-
and
-
ten
of
the
old
jewish
proverb
-
book
.
but
then
you
see
that
was
written
of
syria
,
a
hot
dry
country
,
where
people
live
faster
than
in
our
temperate
climate
.
however
,
i
do
not
think
it
matters
much
,
so
long
as
a
man
is
healthy
and
happy
while
he
is
alive
.
but
now
,
guest
,
we
are
so
near
to
my
old
kinsman
'
s
dwelling
-
place
that
i
think
you
had
better
keep
all
future
questions
for
him
.
"
i
nodded
a
yes
;
and
therewith
we
turned
to
the
left
,
and
went
down
a
gentle
slope
through
some
beautiful
rose
-
gardens
,
laid
out
on
what
i
took
to
be
the
site
of
endell
street
.
we
passed
on
,
and
dick
drew
rein
an
instant
as
we
came
across
a
long
straightish
road
with
houses
scantily
scattered
up
and
down
it
.
he
waved
his
hand
right
and
left
,
and
said
,
"
holborn
that
side
,
oxford
road
that
.
this
was
once
a
very
important
part
of
the
crowded
city
outside
the
ancient
walls
of
the
roman
and
mediaeval
burg
:
many
of
the
feudal
nobles
of
the
middle
ages
,
we
are
told
,
had
big
houses
on
either
side
of
holborn
.
i
daresay
you
remember
that
the
bishop
of
ely
'
s
house
is
mentioned
in
shakespeare
'
s
play
of
king
richard
iii
.
;
and
there
are
some
remains
of
that
still
left
.
however
,
this
road
is
not
of
the
same
importance
,
now
that
the
ancient
city
is
gone
,
walls
and
all
.
"
he
drove
on
again
,
while
i
smiled
faintly
to
think
how
the
nineteenth
century
,
of
which
such
big
words
have
been
said
,
counted
for
nothing
in
the
memory
of
this
man
,
who
read
shakespeare
and
had
not
forgotten
the
middle
ages
.
we
crossed
the
road
into
a
short
narrow
lane
between
the
gardens
,
and
came
out
again
into
a
wide
road
,
on
one
side
of
which
was
a
great
and
long
building
,
turning
its
gables
away
from
the
highway
,
which
i
saw
at
once
was
another
public
group
.
opposite
to
it
was
a
wide
space
of
greenery
,
without
any
wall
or
fence
of
any
kind
.
i
looked
through
the
trees
and
saw
beyond
them
a
pillared
portico
quite
familiar
to
me
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
no
less
old
a
friend
,
in
fact
,
than
the
british
museum
.
it
rather
took
my
breath
away
,
amidst
all
the
strange
things
i
had
seen
;
but
i
held
my
tongue
and
let
dick
speak
.
said
he
:
"
yonder
is
the
british
museum
,
where
my
great
-
grandfather
mostly
lives
;
so
i
wo
not
say
much
about
it
.
the
building
on
the
left
is
the
museum
market
,
and
i
think
we
had
better
turn
in
there
for
a
minute
or
two
;
for
greylocks
will
be
wanting
his
rest
and
his
oats
;
and
i
suppose
you
will
stay
with
my
kinsman
the
greater
part
of
the
day
;
and
to
say
the
truth
,
there
may
be
some
one
there
whom
i
particularly
want
to
see
,
and
perhaps
have
a
long
talk
with
.
"
he
blushed
and
sighed
,
not
altogether
with
pleasure
,
i
thought
;
so
of
course
i
said
nothing
,
and
he
turned
the
horse
under
an
archway
which
brought
us
into
a
very
large
paved
quadrangle
,
with
a
big
sycamore
tree
in
each
corner
and
a
plashing
fountain
in
the
midst
.
near
the
fountain
were
a
few
market
stalls
,
with
awnings
over
them
of
gay
striped
linen
cloth
,
about
which
some
people
,
mostly
women
and
children
,
were
moving
quietly
,
looking
at
the
goods
exposed
there
.
the
ground
floor
of
the
building
round
the
quadrangle
was
occupied
by
a
wide
arcade
or
cloister
,
whose
fanciful
but
strong
architecture
i
could
not
enough
admire
.
here
also
a
few
people
were
sauntering
or
sitting
reading
on
the
benches
.
dick
said
to
me
apologetically
:
"
here
as
elsewhere
there
is
little
doing
to
-
day
;
on
a
friday
you
would
see
it
thronged
,
and
gay
with
people
,
and
in
the
afternoon
there
is
generally
music
about
the
fountain
.
however
,
i
daresay
we
shall
have
a
pretty
good
gathering
at
our
mid
-
day
meal
.
"
we
drove
through
the
quadrangle
and
by
an
archway
,
into
a
large
handsome
stable
on
the
other
side
,
where
we
speedily
stalled
the
old
nag
and
made
him
happy
with
horse
-
meat
,
and
then
turned
and
walked
back
again
through
the
market
,
dick
looking
rather
thoughtful
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
.
i
noticed
that
people
could
not
help
looking
at
me
rather
hard
,
and
considering
my
clothes
and
theirs
,
i
did
not
wonder
;
but
whenever
they
caught
my
eye
they
made
me
a
very
friendly
sign
of
greeting
.
we
walked
straight
into
the
forecourt
of
the
museum
,
where
,
except
that
the
railings
were
gone
,
and
the
whispering
boughs
of
the
trees
were
all
about
,
nothing
seemed
changed
;
the
very
pigeons
were
wheeling
about
the
building
and
clinging
to
the
ornaments
of
the
pediment
as
i
had
seen
them
of
old
.
dick
seemed
grown
a
little
absent
,
but
he
could
not
forbear
giving
me
an
architectural
note
,
and
said
:
"
it
is
rather
an
ugly
old
building
,
is
not
it
?
many
people
have
wanted
to
pull
it
down
and
rebuild
it
:
and
perhaps
if
work
does
really
get
scarce
we
may
yet
do
so
.
but
,
as
my
great
grandfather
will
tell
you
,
it
would
not
be
quite
a
straightforward
job
;
for
there
are
wonderful
collections
in
there
of
all
kinds
of
antiquities
,
besides
an
enormous
library
with
many
exceedingly
beautiful
books
in
it
,
and
many
most
useful
ones
as
genuine
records
,
texts
of
ancient
works
and
the
like
;
and
the
worry
and
anxiety
,
and
even
risk
,
there
would
be
in
moving
all
this
has
saved
the
buildings
themselves
.
besides
,
as
we
said
before
,
it
is
not
a
bad
thing
to
have
some
record
of
what
our
forefathers
thought
a
handsome
building
.
for
there
is
plenty
of
labour
and
material
in
it
.
"
"
i
see
there
is
,
"
said
i
,
"
and
i
quite
agree
with
you
.
but
now
had
not
we
better
make
haste
to
see
your
great
-
grandfather
?
"
in
fact
,
i
could
not
help
seeing
that
he
was
rather
dallying
with
the
time
.
he
said
,
"
yes
,
we
will
go
into
the
house
in
a
minute
.
my
kinsman
is
too
old
to
do
much
work
in
the
museum
,
where
he
was
a
custodian
of
the
books
for
many
years
;
but
he
still
lives
here
a
good
deal
;
indeed
i
think
,
"
said
he
,
smiling
,
"
that
he
looks
upon
himself
as
a
part
of
the
books
,
or
the
books
a
part
of
him
,
i
do
not
know
which
.
"
he
hesitated
a
little
longer
,
then
flushing
up
,
took
my
hand
,
and
saying
,
"
come
along
,
then
!
"
led
me
toward
the
door
of
one
of
the
old
official
dwellings
.
"
your
kinsman
does
not
much
care
for
beautiful
building
,
then
,
"
said
i
,
as
we
entered
the
rather
dreary
classical
house
;
which
indeed
was
as
bare
as
need
be
,
except
for
some
big
pots
of
the
june
flowers
which
stood
about
here
and
there
;
though
it
was
very
clean
and
nicely
whitewashed
.
"
o
i
do
not
know
,
"
said
dick
,
rather
absently
.
"
he
is
getting
old
,
certainly
,
for
he
is
over
a
hundred
and
five
,
and
no
doubt
he
does
not
care
about
moving
.
but
of
course
he
could
live
in
a
prettier
house
if
he
liked
:
he
is
not
obliged
to
live
in
one
place
any
more
than
any
one
else
.
this
way
,
guest
.
"
and
he
led
the
way
upstairs
,
and
opening
a
door
we
went
into
a
fair
-
sized
room
of
the
old
type
,
as
plain
as
the
rest
of
the
house
,
with
a
few
necessary
pieces
of
furniture
,
and
those
very
simple
and
even
rude
,
but
solid
and
with
a
good
deal
of
carving
about
them
,
well
designed
but
rather
crudely
executed
.
at
the
furthest
corner
of
the
room
,
at
a
desk
near
the
window
,
sat
a
little
old
man
in
a
roomy
oak
chair
,
well
becushioned
.
he
was
dressed
in
a
sort
of
norfolk
jacket
of
blue
serge
worn
threadbare
,
with
breeches
of
the
same
,
and
grey
worsted
stockings
.
he
jumped
up
from
his
chair
,
and
cried
out
in
a
voice
of
considerable
volume
for
such
an
old
man
,
"
welcome
,
dick
,
my
lad
;
clara
is
here
,

will
be
more
than

up

"
he
was
stuttering
and
confused
,
clearly
because
he
was
anxious
to
say
nothing
to
make
me
feel
one
too
many
.
but
the
old
man
,
who
had
not
seen
me
at
first
,
helped
him
out
by
coming
forward
and
saying
to
me
in
a
kind
tone
:
"
pray
pardon
me
,
for
i
did
not
notice
that
dick
,
who
is
big
enough
to
hide
anybody

know

brought
a
friend
with
him
.
a
most
hearty
welcome
to
you

all
the
more
,
as
i
almost
hope
that
you
are
going
to
amuse
an
old
man
by
giving
him
news
from
over
sea
,
for
i
can
see
that

from
over
the
water

far
off
countries

"
he
looked
at
me
thoughtfully
,
almost
anxiously
,
as
he
said
in
a
changed
voice
,
"
might
i
ask
you
where
you
come
from

as
you
are
so
clearly
a
stranger
?
"
i
said
in
an
absent
way
:
"
i
used
to
live
in
england
,
and
now
i
am
come
back
again
;

i
slept
last
night
at
the
hammersmith
guest
house
.
"
he
bowed
gravely
,
but
seemed
,
i
thought
,
a
little
disappointed
with
my
answer
.
as
for
me
,
i
was
now
looking
at
him
harder
than
good
manners
allowed
of
;
perhaps
;
for
in
truth
his
face
,
dried
-
apple
-
like
as
it
was
,
seemed
strangely
familiar
to
me
;
as
if
i
had
seen
it
before
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
a
looking
-
glass
it
might
be
,
said
i
to
myself
.
"
well
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
wherever
you
come
from
,
you
are
come
among
friends
.
and
i
see
my
kinsman
richard
hammond
has
an
air
about
him
as
if
he
had
brought
you
here
for
me
to
do
something
for
you
.
is
that
so
,
dick
?
"
dick
,
who
was
getting
still
more
absent
-
minded
and
kept
looking
uneasily
at
the
door
,
managed
to
say
,
"
well
,
yes
,
kinsman
:
our
guest
finds
things
much
altered
,
and
cannot
understand
it
;
nor
can
i
;
so
i
thought
i
would
bring
him
to
you
,
since
you
know
more
of
all
that
has
happened
within
the
last
two
hundred
years
than
any
body
else
does
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
what
'
s
that
?
"
and
he
turned
toward
the
door
again
.
we
heard
footsteps
outside
;
the
door
opened
,
and
in
came
a
very
beautiful
young
woman
,
who
stopped
short
on
seeing
dick
,
and
flushed
as
red
as
a
rose
,
but
faced
him
nevertheless
.
dick
looked
at
her
hard
,
and
half
reached
out
his
hand
toward
her
,
and
his
whole
face
quivered
with
emotion
.
the
old
man
did
not
leave
them
long
in
this
shy
discomfort
,
but
said
,
smiling
with
an
old
man
'
s
mirth
:
"
dick
,
my
lad
,
and
you
,
my
dear
clara
,
i
rather
think
that
we
two
oldsters
are
in
your
way
;
for
i
think
you
will
have
plenty
to
say
to
each
other
.
you
had
better
go
into
nelson
'
s
room
up
above
;
i
know
he
has
gone
out
;
and
he
has
just
been
covering
the
walls
all
over
with
mediaeval
books
,
so
it
will
be
pretty
enough
even
for
you
two
and
your
renewed
pleasure
.
"
the
girl
reached
out
her
hand
to
dick
,
and
taking
his
led
him
out
of
the
room
,
looking
straight
before
her
;
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
her
blushes
came
from
happiness
,
not
anger
;
as
,
indeed
,
love
is
far
more
self
-
conscious
than
wrath
.
when
the
door
had
shut
on
them
the
old
man
turned
to
me
,
still
smiling
,
and
said
:
"
frankly
,
my
dear
guest
,
you
will
do
me
a
great
service
if
you
are
come
to
set
my
old
tongue
wagging
.
my
love
of
talk
still
abides
with
me
,
or
rather
grows
on
me
;
and
though
it
is
pleasant
enough
to
see
these
youngsters
moving
about
and
playing
together
so
seriously
,
as
if
the
whole
world
depended
on
their
kisses
(
as
indeed
it
does
somewhat
)
,
yet
i
do
not
think
my
tales
of
the
past
interest
them
much
.
the
last
harvest
,
the
last
baby
,
the
last
knot
of
carving
in
the
market
-
place
,
is
history
enough
for
them
.
it
was
different
,
i
think
,
when
i
was
a
lad
,
when
we
were
not
so
assured
of
peace
and
continuous
plenty
as
we
are
now
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
well
,
well
!
without
putting
you
to
the
question
,
let
me
ask
you
this
:
am
i
to
consider
you
as
an
enquirer
who
knows
a
little
of
our
modern
ways
of
life
,
or
as
one
who
comes
from
some
place
where
the
very
foundations
of
life
are
different
from
ours
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
do
you
know
anything
or
nothing
about
us
?
"
he
looked
at
me
keenly
and
with
growing
wonder
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
;
and
i
answered
in
a
low
voice
:
"
i
know
only
so
much
of
your
modern
life
as
i
could
gather
from
using
my
eyes
on
the
way
here
from
hammersmith
,
and
from
asking
some
questions
of
richard
hammond
,
most
of
which
he
could
hardly
understand
.
"
the
old
man
smiled
at
this
.
"
then
,
"
said
he
,
"
i
am
to
speak
to
you
as
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
"
as
if
i
were
a
being
from
another
planet
,
"
said
i
.
the
old
man
,
whose
name
,
by
the
bye
,
like
his
kinsman
'
s
,
was
hammond
,
smiled
and
nodded
,
and
wheeling
his
seat
round
to
me
,
bade
me
sit
in
a
heavy
oak
chair
,
and
said
,
as
he
saw
my
eyes
fix
on
its
curious
carving
:
"
yes
,
i
am
much
tied
to
the
past
,
my
past
,
you
understand
.
these
very
pieces
of
furniture
belong
to
a
time
before
my
early
days
;
it
was
my
father
who
got
them
made
;
if
they
had
been
done
within
the
last
fifty
years
they
would
have
been
much
cleverer
in
execution
;
but
i
do
not
think
i
should
have
liked
them
the
better
.
we
were
almost
beginning
again
in
those
days
:
and
they
were
brisk
,
hot
-
headed
times
.
but
you
hear
how
garrulous
i
am
:
ask
me
questions
,
ask
me
questions
about
anything
,
dear
guest
;
since
i
must
talk
,
make
my
talk
profitable
to
you
.
"
i
was
silent
for
a
minute
,
and
then
i
said
,
somewhat
nervously
:
"
excuse
me
if
i
am
rude
;
but
i
am
so
much
interested
in
richard
,
since
he
has
been
so
kind
to
me
,
a
perfect
stranger
,
that
i
should
like
to
ask
a
question
about
him
.
"
"
well
,
"
said
old
hammond
,
"
if
he
were
not
'
kind
'
,
as
you
call
it
,
to
a
perfect
stranger
he
would
be
thought
a
strange
person
,
and
people
would
be
apt
to
shun
him
.
but
ask
on
,
ask
on
!
do
not
be
shy
of
asking
.
"
said
i
:
"
that
beautiful
girl
,
is
he
going
to
be
married
to
her
?
"
"
well
,
"
said
he
,
"
yes
,
he
is
.
he
has
been
married
to
her
once
already
,
and
now
i
should
say
it
is
pretty
clear
that
he
will
be
married
to
her
again
.
"
"
indeed
,
"
quoth
i
,
wondering
what
that
meant
.
"
here
is
the
whole
tale
,
"
said
old
hammond
;
"
a
short
one
enough
;
and
now
i
hope
a
happy
one
:
they
lived
together
two
years
the
first
time
;
were
both
very
young
;
and
then
she
got
it
into
her
head
that
she
was
in
love
with
somebody
else
.
so
she
left
poor
dick
;
i
say
poor
dick
,
because
he
had
not
found
any
one
else
.
but
it
did
not
last
long
,
only
about
a
year
.
then
she
came
to
me
,
as
she
was
in
the
habit
of
bringing
her
troubles
to
the
old
carle
,
and
asked
me
how
dick
was
,
and
whether
he
was
happy
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
so
i
saw
how
the
land
lay
,
and
said
that
he
was
very
unhappy
,
and
not
at
all
well
;
which
last
at
any
rate
was
a
lie
.
there
,
you
can
guess
the
rest
.
clara
came
to
have
a
long
talk
with
me
to
-
day
,
but
dick
will
serve
her
turn
much
better
.
indeed
,
if
he
had
not
chanced
in
upon
me
to
-
day
i
should
have
had
to
have
sent
for
him
to
-
morrow
.
"
"
dear
me
,
"
said
i
.
"
have
they
any
children
?
"
"
yes
,
"
said
he
,
"
two
;
they
are
staying
with
one
of
my
daughters
at
present
,
where
,
indeed
,
clara
has
mostly
been
.
i
would
not
lose
sight
of
her
,
as
i
felt
sure
they
would
come
together
again
:
and
dick
,
who
is
the
best
of
good
fellows
,
really
took
the
matter
to
heart
.
you
see
,
he
had
no
other
love
to
run
to
,
as
she
had
.
so
i
managed
it
all
;
as
i
have
done
with
such
-
like
matters
before
.
"
"
ah
,
"
said
i
,
"
no
doubt
you
wanted
to
keep
them
out
of
the
divorce
court
:
but
i
suppose
it
often
has
to
settle
such
matters
.
"
"
then
you
suppose
nonsense
,
"
said
he
.
"
i
know
that
there
used
to
be
such
lunatic
affairs
as
divorce
-
courts
:
but
just
consider
;
all
the
cases
that
came
into
them
were
matters
of
property
quarrels
:
and
i
think
,
dear
guest
,
"
said
he
,
smiling
,
"
that
though
you
do
come
from
another
planet
,
you
can
see
from
the
mere
outside
look
of
our
world
that
quarrels
about
private
property
could
not
go
on
amongst
us
in
our
days
.
"
indeed
,
my
drive
from
hammersmith
to
bloomsbury
,
and
all
the
quiet
happy
life
i
had
seen
so
many
hints
of
;
even
apart
from
my
shopping
,
would
have
been
enough
to
tell
me
that
"
the
sacred
rights
of
property
,
"
as
we
used
to
think
of
them
,
were
now
no
more
.
so
i
sat
silent
while
the
old
man
took
up
the
thread
of
the
discourse
again
,
and
said
:
"
well
,
then
,
property
quarrels
being
no
longer
possible
,
what
remains
in
these
matters
that
a
court
of
law
could
deal
with
?
fancy
a
court
for
enforcing
a
contract
of
passion
or
sentiment
!
if
such
a
thing
were
needed
as
a
reductio
ad
absurdum
of
the
enforcement
of
contract
,
such
a
folly
would
do
that
for
us
.
"
he
was
silent
again
a
little
,
and
then
said
:
"
you
must
understand
once
for
all
that
we
have
changed
these
matters
;
or
rather
,
that
our
way
of
looking
at
them
has
changed
,
as
we
have
changed
within
the
last
two
hundred
years
.
we
do
not
deceive
ourselves
,
indeed
,
or
believe
that
we
can
get
rid
of
all
the
trouble
that
besets
the
dealings
between
the
sexes
.
we
know
that
we
must
face
the
unhappiness
that
comes
of
man
and
woman
confusing
the
relations
between
natural
passion
,
and
sentiment
,
and
the
friendship
which
,
when
things
go
well
,
softens
the
awakening
from
passing
illusions
:
but
we
are
not
so
mad
as
to
pile
up
degradation
on
that
unhappiness
by
engaging
in
sordid
squabbles
about
livelihood
and
position
,
and
the
power
of
tyrannising
over
the
children
who
have
been
the
results
of
love
or
lust
.
"
again
he
paused
awhile
,
and
again
went
on
:
"
calf
love
,
mistaken
for
a
heroism
that
shall
be
lifelong
,
yet
early
waning
into
disappointment
;
the
inexplicable
desire
that
comes
on
a
man
of
riper
years
to
be
the
all
-
in
-
all
to
some
one
woman
,
whose
ordinary
human
kindness
and
human
beauty
he
has
idealised
into
superhuman
perfection
,
and
made
the
one
object
of
his
desire
;
or
lastly
the
reasonable
longing
of
a
strong
and
thoughtful
man
to
become
the
most
intimate
friend
of
some
beautiful
and
wise
woman
,
the
very
type
of
the
beauty
and
glory
of
the
world
which
we
love
so
well
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
we
exult
in
all
the
pleasure
and
exaltation
of
spirit
which
goes
with
these
things
,
so
we
set
ourselves
to
bear
the
sorrow
which
not
unseldom
goes
with
them
also
;
remembering
those
lines
of
the
ancient
poet
(
i
quote
roughly
from
memory
one
of
the
many
translations
of

nineteenth
century
)
:
'
for
this
the
gods
have
fashioned
man
'
s
grief
and
evil
day
that
still
for
man
hereafter
might
be
the
tale
and
the
lay
.
'
well
,
well
,
'
tis
little
likely
anyhow
that
all
tales
shall
be
lacking
,
or
all
sorrow
cured
.
"
he
was
silent
for
some
time
,
and
i
would
not
interrupt
him
.
at
last
he
began
again
:
"
but
you
must
know
that
we
of
these
generations
are
strong
and
healthy
of
body
,
and
live
easily
;
we
pass
our
lives
in
reasonable
strife
with
nature
,
exercising
not
one
side
of
ourselves
only
,
but
all
sides
,
taking
the
keenest
pleasure
in
all
the
life
of
the
world
.
so
it
is
a
point
of
honour
with
us
not
to
be
self
-
centred
;
not
to
suppose
that
the
world
must
cease
because
one
man
is
sorry
;
therefore
we
should
think
it
foolish
,
or
if
you
will
,
criminal
,
to
exaggerate
these
matters
of
sentiment
and
sensibility
:
we
are
no
more
inclined
to
eke
out
our
sentimental
sorrows
than
to
cherish
our
bodily
pains
;
and
we
recognise
that
there
are
other
pleasures
besides
love
-
making
.
you
must
remember
,
also
,
that
we
are
long
-
lived
,
and
that
therefore
beauty
both
in
man
and
woman
is
not
so
fleeting
as
it
was
in
the
days
when
we
were
burdened
so
heavily
by
self
-
inflicted
diseases
.
so
we
shake
off
these
griefs
in
a
way
which
perhaps
the
sentimentalists
of
other
times
would
think
contemptible
and
unheroic
,
but
which
we
think
necessary
and
manlike
.
as
on
the
other
hand
,
therefore
,
we
have
ceased
to
be
commercial
in
our
love
-
matters
,
so
also
we
have
ceased
to
be
artificially
foolish
.
the
folly
which
comes
by
nature
,
the
unwisdom
of
the
immature
man
,
or
the
older
man
caught
in
a
trap
,
we
must
put
up
with
that
,
nor
are
we
much
ashamed
of
it
;
but
to
be
conventionally
sensitive
or
sentimental
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
my
friend
,
i
am
old
and
perhaps
disappointed
,
but
at
least
i
think
we
have
cast
off
some
of
the
follies
of
the
older
world
.
"
he
paused
,
as
if
for
some
words
of
mine
;
but
i
held
my
peace
:
then
he
went
on
:
"
at
least
,
if
we
suffer
from
the
tyranny
and
fickleness
of
nature
or
our
own
want
of
experience
,
we
neither
grimace
about
it
,
nor
lie
.
if
there
must
be
sundering
betwixt
those
who
meant
never
to
sunder
,
so
it
must
be
:
but
there
need
be
no
pretext
of
unity
when
the
reality
of
it
is
gone
:
nor
do
we
drive
those
who
well
know
that
they
are
incapable
of
it
to
profess
an
undying
sentiment
which
they
cannot
really
feel
:
thus
it
is
that
as
that
monstrosity
of
venal
lust
is
no
longer
possible
,
so
also
it
is
no
longer
needed
.
do
not
misunderstand
me
.
you
did
not
seemed
shocked
when
i
told
you
that
there
were
no
law
-
courts
to
enforce
contracts
of
sentiment
or
passion
;
but
so
curiously
are
men
made
,
that
perhaps
you
will
be
shocked
when
i
tell
you
that
there
is
no
code
of
public
opinion
which
takes
the
place
of
such
courts
,
and
which
might
be
as
tyrannical
and
unreasonable
as
they
were
.
i
do
not
say
that
people
do
not
judge
their
neighbours
'
conduct
,
sometimes
,
doubtless
,
unfairly
.
but
i
do
say
that
there
is
no
unvarying
conventional
set
of
rules
by
which
people
are
judged
;
no
bed
of
procrustes
to
stretch
or
cramp
their
minds
and
lives
;
no
hypocritical
excommunication
which
people
are
forced
to
pronounce
,
either
by
unconsidered
habit
,
or
by
the
unexpressed
threat
of
the
lesser
interdict
if
they
are
lax
in
their
hypocrisy
.
are
you
shocked
now
?

said
i
,
with
some
hesitation
.
"
it
is
all
so
different

"
"
at
any
rate
,
"
said
he
,
"
one
thing
i

i
can
answer
for

whatever
sentiment
there
is
,
it
is
real
.

.
.
.
.
.
and
general
;
it
is
not
confined
to
people
very
specially
refined
.
i
am
also
pretty
sure
,
as
i
hinted
to
you
just
now
,
that
there
is
not
by
a
great
way
as
much
suffering
involved
in
these
matters
either
to
men
or
to
women
as
there
used
to
be
.
but
excuse
me
for
being
so
prolix
on
this
question
!
you
know
you
asked
to
be
treated
like
a
being
from
another
planet
.
"
"
indeed
i
thank
you
very
much

said
i
.
"
now
may
i
ask
you
about
the
position
of
women
in
your
society
?
"
he
laughed
very
heartily
for
a
man
of
his
years
,
and
said
:
"
it
is
not
without
reason
that
i
have
got
a
reputation
as
a
careful
student
of
history
.
i
believe
i
really
do
understand
'
the
emancipation
of
women
movement
'
of
the
nineteenth
century

i
doubt

i
,
a
little
bit
nettled
by
his
merriment
.
"

"
said
he
,
"
of
course
you
will
see
that
all
that
is
a
dead
controversy
now
.
the
men
have
no
longer
any
opportunity
of
tyrannising
over
the
women
,
or
the
women
over
the
men
;
both
of
which
things
took
place
in
those
old
times
.
the
women
do
what
they
can
do
best
,
and
what
they
like
best
,
and
the
men
are
neither
jealous
of
it
or
injured
by
it
.
this
is
such
a
commonplace
that
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
state
it
.
"
i
said
,
"
o

do
they
take
any
part
in
that

"
hammond
smiled
and
said
:
"
i
think
you
may
wait
for
an
answer
to
that
question
till
we
get
on
to
the
subject

may
be
novelties

you

"
"

i
said
;
"

about
this
woman
question
?
i
saw
at
the
guest
house
that
the
women
were
waiting
on
the
men
:
that
seems
a
little
like
reaction
does
not
it
?
"
"
does
it
?
"
said
the
old
man
;
"
perhaps
you
think
housekeeping
an
unimportant
occupation
,
not
deserving
of
respect
.
i
believe
that
was
the
opinion
of
the
'
advanced
'
women
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
and
their
male
backers
.
if
it
is
yours
,
i
recommend
to
your
notice
an
old
norwegian
folk
-
lore
tale
called
how
the
man
minded
the
house
,
or
some
such
title
;
the
result
of
which
minding
was
that
,
after
various
tribulations
,
the
man
and
the
family
cow
balanced
each
other
at
the
end
of
a
rope
,
the
man
hanging
halfway
up
the
chimney
,
the
cow
dangling
from
the
roof
,
which
,
after
the
fashion
of
the
country
,
was
of
turf
and
sloping
down
low
to
the
ground
.
hard
on
the
cow
,
_
i
_
think
.
of
course
no
such
mishap
could
happen
to
such
a
superior
person
as
yourself
,
"
he
added
,
chuckling
.
i
sat
somewhat
uneasy
under
this
dry
gibe
.
indeed
,
his
manner
of
treating
this
latter
part
of
the
question
seemed
to
me
a
little
disrespectful
.
"
come
,
now
,
my
friend
,
"
quoth
he
,
"
do
not
you
know
that
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
a
clever
woman
to
manage
a
house
skilfully
,
and
to
do
it
so
that
all
the
house

mates
about
her
look
pleased
,

are
grateful
to
her

then
,

be
ordered
about

a
pretty

one
of
the

the
old
fellow
chuckled
again
,

at
last
fairly
burst
out
laughing
.
"

me

said
he
,
after
a
while
;
"
i

not
laughing

at
that
silly
nineteenth

current
amongst

cultivated
people

ignoring
all
the
steps
by
which
their

low

"
said
i
:
"
perhaps
that
is
so
;
but
people
putting
in
practice
commonly
this
sense
of
interest
in
the
ordinary
occupations
of
life
rather
startles
me
.
i
will
ask
you
a
question
or
two
presently
about
that
.
but
i
want
to
return
to
the
position
of
women
amongst
you
.
you
have
studied
the
'
emancipation
of
women
'
business
of
the
nineteenth
century
:
do
not
you
remember
that
some
of
the
'
superior
'
women
wanted
to
emancipate
the
more
intelligent
part
of
their
sex
from
the
bearing
of
children
?
"
the
old
man
grew
quite
serious
again
.
said
he
:
"
i
do
remember
about
that
strange
piece
of
baseless
folly
,
the
result
,
like
all
other
follies
of
the
period
,
of
the
hideous
class
tyranny
which
then
obtained
.
what
do
we
think
of
it
now
?
you
would
say
.
my
friend
,
that
is
a
question
easy
to
answer
.
how
could
it
possibly
be
but
that
maternity
should
be
highly
honoured
amongst
us
?
surely
it
is
a
matter
of
course
that
the
natural
and
necessary
pains
which
the
mother
must
go
through
form
a
bond
of
union
between
man
and
woman
,
an
extra
stimulus
to
love
and
affection
between
them
,
and
that
this
is
universally
recognised
.
for
the
rest
,
remember
that
all
the
artificial
burdens
of
motherhood
are
now
done
away
with
.
a
mother
has
no
longer
any
mere
sordid
anxieties
for
the
future
of
her
children
.
they
may
indeed
turn
out
better
or
worse
;
they
may
disappoint
her
highest
hopes
;
such
anxieties
as
these
are
a
part
of
the
mingled
pleasure
and
pain
which
goes
to
make
up
the
life
of
mankind
.
but
at
least
she
is
spared
the
fear
(
it
was
most
commonly
the
certainty
)
that
artificial
disabilities
would
make
her
children
something
less
than
men
and
women
:
she
knows
that
they
will
live
and
act
according
to
the
measure
of
their
own
faculties
.
in
times
past
,
it
is
clear
that
the
'
society
'
of
the
day
helped
its
judaic
god
,
and
the
'
man
of
science
'
of
the
time
,
in
visiting
the
sins
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
.
how
to
reverse
this
process
,
how
to
take
the
sting
out
of
heredity
,
has
for
long
been
one
of
the
most
constant
cares
of
the
thoughtful
men
amongst
us
.
so
that
,
you
see
,
the
ordinarily
healthy
woman
(
and
almost
all
our
women
are
both
healthy
and
at
least
comely
)
,
respected
as
a
child
-
bearer
and
rearer
of
children
,
desired
as
a
woman
,
loved
as
a
companion
,
unanxious
for
the
future
of
her
children
,
has
far
more
instinct
for
maternity
than
the
poor
drudge
and
mother
of
drudges
of
past
days
could
ever
have
had
;
or
than
her
sister
of
the
upper
classes
,
brought
up

i

point
out
to
you
a
token
of
all
the
benefits
which
we
have
gained
by
our
freedom

you
have

said
i
:
"
i
could
hardly
have

there
could
be
so
many
good

looking
people

crowed
a

the

he
was

"
what
!
are
we
still
civilised
?
"
said
he
.
"
well
,
as
to
our
looks
,
the
english
and
jutish
blood
,
which
on
the
whole
is
predominant
here
,
used
not
to
produce
much
beauty
.
but
i
think
we
have
improved
it
.
i
know
a
man
who
has
a
large
collection
of
portraits
printed
from
photographs
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
and
going
over
those
and
comparing
them
with
the
everyday
faces
in
these
times
,
puts
the
improvement
in
our
good
looks
beyond
a
doubt
.
now
,
there
are
some
people
who
think
it
not
too
fantastic
to
connect
this
increase
of
beauty
directly
with
our
freedom
and
good
sense
in
the
matters
we
have
been
speaking
of
:
they
believe
that
a
child
born
from
the
natural
and
healthy
love
between
a
man
and
a
woman
,
even
if
that
be
transient
,
is
likely
to
turn
out
better
in
all
ways
,
and
especially
in
bodily
beauty
,
than
the
birth
of
the
respectable
commercial
marriage
bed
,
or
of
the
dull
despair
of
the
drudge
of
that
system
.
they
say
,
pleasure
begets
pleasure
.
what
do
you
think
?
"
"
i
am
much
of
that
mind
,
"
said
i
.
"

said
the
old
man
,
shifting
in
his
chair
,
"

some

"
said
i
:
"
i
want
an
extra
word
or
two
about
your
ideas
of

although
i
gathered
from
dick
that
you
let
your
children
run
wild
and
did
not
teach
them
anything
;
and
in
short
,
that
you
have
so
refined
your

none

quoth
he
.
"
but
of
course
i
understand
your
point
of
view
about
education
,
which
is
that
of
times
past
,
when

the
struggle
for
life
,

as
men
used
to
phrase
it
(

the

for
a

'

on
one
side
,

for
a
bouncing
share
of
the
slave
-
holders
'
privilege
on
the
other
)
,
pinched
'
education
'
for
most
people
into
a
niggardly
dole
of
not
very
accurate
information
;
something
to
be
swallowed
by
the
beginner
in
the
art
of
living
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
,
and
was
hungry
for
it
or
not
:
and
which
had
been
chewed
and
digested
over
and
over
again
by
people
who
did
not
care
about
it
in
order
to
serve
it
out
to
other
people
who
did
not
care
about
it
.
"
i
stopped
the
old
man
'
s
rising
wrath
by
a
laugh
,
and
said
:
"
well
,
you
were
not
taught
that
way
,
at
any
rate
,
so
you
may
let
your
anger
run
off
you
a
little
.
"
"
true
,
true
,
"
said
he
,
smiling
.
"
i
thank
you
for
correcting
my
ill
-
temper
:
i
always
fancy
myself
as
living
in
any
period
of
which
we
may
be
speaking
.
but
,
however
,
to
put
it
in
a
cooler
way
:
you
expected
to
see
children
thrust
into
schools
when
they
had
reached
an
age
conventionally
supposed
to
be
the
due
age
,
whatever
their
varying
faculties
and
dispositions
might
be
,
and
when
there
,
with
like
disregard
to
facts
to
be
subjected
to
a
certain
conventional
course
of
'
learning
.
'
my
friend
,
ca
not
you
see
that
such
a
proceeding
means
ignoring
the
fact
of
growth
,
bodily
and
mental
?
no
one
could
come
out
of
such
a
mill
uninjured
;
and
those
only
would
avoid
being
crushed
by
it
who
would
have
the
spirit
of
rebellion
strong
in
them
.
fortunately
most
children
have
had
that
at
all
times
,
or
i
do
not
know
that
we
should
ever
have
reached
our
present
position
.
now
you
see
what
it
all
comes
to
.
in
the
old
times
all
this
was
the
result
of
poverty
.
in
the
nineteenth
century
,
society
was
so
miserably
poor
,
owing
to
the
systematised
robbery
on
which
it
was
founded
,
that
real
education
was
impossible
for
anybody
.
the
whole
theory
of
their
so
-
called
education
was
that
it
was
necessary
to
shove
a
little
information
into
a
child
,
even
if
it
were
by
means
of
torture
,
and
accompanied
by
twaddle
which
it
was
well
known
was
of
no
use
,
or
else
he
would
lack
information
lifelong
:
the
hurry
of
poverty
forbade
anything
else
.
all
that
is
past
;
we
are
no
longer
hurried
,
and
the
information
lies
ready
to
each
one
'
s
hand
when
his
own
inclinations
impel
him
to
seek
it
.
in
this
as
in
other
matters
we
have
become
wealthy
:
we
can
afford
to
give
ourselves
time
to
grow
.
"
"
yes
,
"
said
i
,
"
but
suppose
the
child
,
youth
,
man
,
never
wants
the
information
,
never
grows
in
the
direction
you
might
hope
him
to
do
:
suppose
,
for
instance
,
he
objects
to
learning
arithmetic
or
mathematics
;
you
ca
not
force
him
when
he
is
grown
;
ca
not
you
force
him
while
he
is
growing
,
and
ought
not
you
to
do
so
?
"
"
well
,
"
said
he
,
"
were
you
forced
to
learn
arithmetic
and
mathematics
?
"
"
a
little
,

said
i
.
"
and
how
old
are
you
now

"
"

six

said
i
.
"
and
how
much
arithmetic
and
mathematics
do
you
know
now
?
"
quoth
the
old
man
,
smiling
rather
mockingly
.
said
i
:
"
none
whatever
,
i
am
sorry
to
say
.
"
hammond
laughed
quietly
,
but
made
no
other
comment
on
my
admission
,
and
i
dropped
the
subject
of
education
,
perceiving
him
to
be
hopeless
on
that
side
.
i
thought
a
little
,
and
said
:
"
you
were
speaking
just
now
of
households
:
that
sounded
to
me
a
little
like
the
customs
of
past
times
;
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
lived
more
in
public
.
"
"
phalangsteries
,
eh
?
"
said
he
.
"
well
,
we
live
as
we
like
,
and
we
like
to
live
as
a
rule
with
certain
house
-
mates
that
we
have
got
used
to
.
remember
,
again
,
that
poverty
is
extinct
,
and
that
the
fourierist
phalangsteries
and
all
their
kind
,
as
was
but
natural
at
the
time
,
implied
nothing
but
a
refuge
from
mere
destitution
.
such
a
way
of
life
as
that
,
could
only
have
been
conceived
of
by
people
surrounded
by
the
worst
form
of
poverty
.
but
you
must
understand
therewith
,
that
though
separate
households
are
the
rule
amongst
us
,
and
though
they
differ
in
their
habits
more
or
less
,
yet
no
door
is
shut
to
any
good
-
tempered
person
who
is
content
to
live
as
the
other
house
-
mates
do
:
only
of
course
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
one
man
to
drop
into
a
household
and
bid
the
folk
of
it
to
alter
their
habits
to
please
him
,
since
he
can
go
elsewhere
and
live
as
he
pleases
.
however
,
i
need
not
say
much
about
all
this
,
as
you
are
going
up
the
river
with
dick
,
and
will
find
out
for
yourself
by
experience
how
these
matters
are
managed
.
"
after
a
pause
,
i
said
:

"
"

perhaps

it

of
the
nineteenth
century
was
.
but
let
that
pass

after
all

is
a
good
deal

at
a

hour

"
but
some
memory
of
it

with

i
am
glad
of
it
.
once
a
year
,
on
may
-
day
,
we
hold
a
solemn
feast
in
those
easterly
communes
of
london
to
commemorate
the
clearing
of
misery
,
as
it
is
called
.
on
that
day
we
have
music
and
dancing
,
and
merry
games
and
happy
feasting
on
the
site
of
some
of
the
worst
of
the
old
slums
,
the
traditional
memory
of
which
we
have
kept
.
on
that
occasion
the
custom
is
for
the
prettiest
girls
to
sing
some
of
the
old
revolutionary
songs
,
and
those
which
were
the
groans
of
the
discontent
,
once
so
hopeless
,
on
the
very
spots
where
those
terrible
crimes
of
class
-
murder
were
committed
day
by
day
for
so
many
years
.
to
a
man
like
me
,
who
have
studied
the
past
so
diligently
,
it
is
a
curious
and
touching
sight
to
see
some
beautiful
girl
,
daintily
clad
,
and
crowned
with
flowers
from
the
neighbouring
meadows
,
standing
amongst
the
happy
people
,
on
some
mound
where
of
old
time
stood
the
wretched
apology
for
a
house
,
a
den
in
which
men
and
women
lived
packed
amongst
the
filth
like
pilchards
in
a
cask
;
lived
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
only
have
endured
it
,
as
i
said
just
now
,
by
being
degraded
out
of
humanity
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
hear
the
terrible
words
of
threatening
and
lamentation
coming
from
her
sweet
and
beautiful
lips
,
and
she
unconscious
of
their
real
meaning
:
to
hear
her
,
for
instance
,
singing
hood
'

song
of
the
shirt
,

to
think

all
the
time

does
not
understand
what
it
is
all
about

.
.
.
.
.

a
tragedy
grown
inconceivable
to
her

eyes
glittered
,

how
the
fresh
life
seemed
to
glow
in
his
face
,

i
wondered
how
at
his
age
he
should
think
of
the
happiness
of
the
world
,

indeed
anything

dinner

tell
me
in
detail
,
"
said
i
,
"
what
lies
east
of
bloomsbury
now
?
"
said
he
:
"
there
are
but
few
houses
between
this
and
the
outer
part
of
the
old
city
;
but
in
the
city
we
have
a
thickly
-
dwelling
population
.
our
forefathers
,
in
the
first
clearing
of
the
slums
,
were
not
in
a
hurry
to
pull
down
the
houses
in
what
was
called
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
business
quarter
of
the
town
,
and
what
later
got
to
be
known
as
the
swindling
kens
.
you
see
,
these
houses
,
though
they
stood
hideously
thick
on
the
ground
,
were
roomy
and
fairly
solid
in
building
,
and
clean
,
because
they
were
not
used
for
living
in
,
but
as
mere
gambling
booths
;
so
the
poor
people
from
the
cleared
slums
took
them
for
lodgings
and
dwelt
there
,
till
the
folk
of
those
days
had
time
to
think
of
something
better
for
them
;
so
the
buildings
were
pulled
down
so
gradually
that
people
got
used
to
living
thicker
on
the
ground
there
than
in
most
places
;
therefore
it
remains
the
most
populous
part
of
london
,
or
perhaps
of
all
these
islands
.
but
it
is
very
pleasant
there
,
partly
because
of
the
splendour
of
the
architecture
,
which
goes
further
than
what
you
will
see
elsewhere
.
however
,
this
crowding
,
if
it
may
be
called
so
,
does
not
go
further
than
a
street
called
aldgate
,
a
name
which
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
of
.
beyond
that
the
houses
are
scattered
wide
about
the
meadows
there
,
which
are
very
beautiful
,
especially
when
you
get
on
to
the
lovely
river
lea
(
where
old
isaak
walton
used
to
fish
,
you
know
)
about
the
places
called
stratford
and
old
ford
,
names
which
of
course
you
will
not
have
heard
of
,
though
the
romans
were
busy
there
once
upon
a
time
.
"
not
heard
of
them
!
thought
i
to
myself
.
how
strange
!
that
i
who
had
seen
the
very
last
remnant
of
the
pleasantness
of
the
meadows
by
the
lea
destroyed
,
should
have
heard
them
spoken
of
with
pleasantness
come
back
to
them
in
full
measure
.
hammond
went
on
:
"
when
you
get
down
to
the
thames
side
you
come
on
the
docks
,
which
are
works
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
and
are
still
in
use
,
although
not
so
thronged
as
they
once
were
,
since
we
discourage
centralisation
all
we
can
,
and
we
have
long
ago
dropped
the
pretension
to
be
the
market
of
the
world
.
about
these
docks
are
a
good
few
houses
,
which
,
however
,
are
not
inhabited
by
many
people
permanently
;
i
mean
,
those
who
use
them
come
and
go
a
good
deal
,
the
place
being
too
low
and
marshy
for
pleasant
dwelling
.
past
the
docks
eastward
and
landward
it
is
all
flat
pasture
,
once
marsh
,
except
for
a
few
gardens
,
and
there
are
very
few
permanent
dwellings
there
:
scarcely
anything
but
a
few
sheds
,
and
cots
for
the
men
who
come
to
look
after
the
great
herds
of
cattle
pasturing
there
.
but
however
,
what
with
the
beasts
and
the
men
,
and
the
scattered
red
-
tiled
roofs
and
the
big
hayricks
,
it
does
not
make
a
bad
holiday
to
get
a
quiet
pony
and
ride
about
there
on
a
sunny
afternoon
of
autumn
,
and
look
over
the
river
and
the
craft
passing
up
and
down
,
and
on
to
shooters
'
hill
and
the
kentish
uplands
,
and
then
turn
round
to
the
wide
green
sea
of
the
essex
marsh
-
land
,
with
the
great
domed
line
of
the
sky
,
and
the
sun
shining
down
in
one
flood
of
peaceful
light
over
the
long
distance
.
there
is
a
place
called
canning
'
s
town
,
and
further
out
,
silvertown
,
where
the
pleasant
meadows
are
at
their
pleasantest
:
doubtless
they
were
once
slums
,
and
wretched
enough
.
"
the
names
grated
on
my
ear
,
but
i
could
not
explain
why
to
him
.
so
i
said
:
"
and
south
of
the
river
,
what
is
it
like
?
"
he
said
:
"
you
would
find
it
much
the
same
as
the
land
about
hammersmith
.
north
,
again
,
the
land
runs
up
high
,
and
there
is
an
agreeable
and
well
-
built
town
called
hampstead
,
which
fitly
ends
london
on
that
side
.
it
looks
down
on
the
north
-
western
end
of
the
forest
you
passed
through
.
"
i
smiled
.
"
so
much
for
what
was
once
london
,
"
said
i
.
"
now
tell
me
about
the
other
towns
of
the
country
.
"
he
said
:
"
as
to
the
big
murky
places
which
were
once
,
as
we
know
,
the
centres
of
manufacture
,
they
have
,
like
the
brick
and
mortar
desert
of
london
,
disappeared
;
only
,
since
they
were
centres
of
nothing
but
'
manufacture
,
'
and
served
no
purpose
but
that
of
the
gambling
market
,
they
have
left
less
signs
of
their
existence
than
london
.
of
course
,
the
great
change
in
the
use
of
mechanical
force
made
this
an
easy
matter
,
and
some
approach
to
their
break
-
up
as
centres
would
probably
have
taken
place
,
even
if
we
had
not
changed
our
habits
so
much
:
but
they
being
such
as
they
were
,
no
sacrifice
would
have
seemed
too
great
a
price
to
pay
for
getting
rid
of
the
'
manufacturing
districts
,
'
as
they
used
to
be
called
.
for
the
rest
,
whatever
coal
or
mineral
we
need
is
brought
to
grass
and
sent
whither
it
is
needed
with
as
little
as
possible
of
dirt
,
confusion
,
and
the
distressing
of
quiet
people
'
s
lives
.
one
is
tempted
to
believe
from
what
one
has
read
of
the
condition
of
those
districts
in
the
nineteenth
century
,
that
those
who
had
them
under
their
power
worried
,
befouled
,
and
degraded
men
out
of
malice
prepense
:
but
it
was
not
so
;
like
the
mis
-
education
of
which
we
were
talking
just
now
,
it
came
of
their
dreadful
poverty
.
they
were
obliged
to
put
up
with
everything
,
and
even
pretend
that
they
liked
it
;
whereas
we
can
now
deal
with
things
reasonably
,
and
refuse
to
be
saddled
with
what
we
do
not
want
.
"
i
confess
i
was
not
sorry
to
cut
short
with
a
question
his
glorifications
of
the
age
he
lived
in
.
said
i
:
"
how
about
the
smaller
towns
?
i
suppose
you
have
swept
those
away
entirely
?
"
"
no
,
no
,
"
said
he
,
"
it
has
not
gone
that
way
.
on
the
contrary
,
there
has
been
but
little
clearance
,
though
much
rebuilding
,
in
the
smaller
towns
.
their
suburbs
,
indeed
,
when
they
had
any
,
have
melted
away
into
the
general
country
,
and
space
and
elbow
-
room
has
been
got
in
their
centres
:
but
there
are
the
towns
still
with
their
streets
and
squares
and
market
-
places
;
so
that
it
is
by
means
of
these
smaller
towns
that
we
of
to

day
can
get
some
kind
of
idea
of
what
the
towns
of
the
older
world
were
like

oxford

instance

said
i

said

,

i
suppose
oxford
was
beautiful
even
in

the
great
interest

"
well
,
it
has
reverted
to
some
of
its
best
traditions
;
so
you
may
imagine
how
far
it
is
from
its
nineteenth
-
century
position
.
it
is
real
learning

the
art

.
.
.
.
.
which
is
followed
there
,
not
the
commercial
learning
of
the
past

though
perhaps
you
do
not
know
that
in
the
nineteenth
century
oxford
and
its
less
interesting
sister
cambridge
became
definitely
commercial
.
they
(
and
especially
oxford
)
were
the
breeding
places
of
a
peculiar
class
of
parasites
,
who
called
themselves
cultivated
people
;
they
were
indeed
cynical
enough
,
as
the
so
-
called
educated
classes
of
the
day
generally
were
;
but
they
affected
an
exaggeration
of
cynicism
in
order
that
they
might
be
thought
knowing
and
worldly
-
wise
.
the
rich
middle
classes
(
they
had
no
relation
with
the
working
classes
)
treated
them
with
the
kind
of
contemptuous
toleration
with
which
a
mediaeval
baron
treated
his
jester
;
though
it
must
be
said
that
they
were
by
no
means
so
pleasant
as
the
old
jesters
were
,
being
,
in
fact
,
the
bores
of
society
.
they
were
laughed
at
,
despised
.
.

which
last
was
what
they
aimed
at
.
"

is
to
reverse
contemporary
judgments

you

toward

nineteenth

the

were
almost
destroyed
,

where
they
became
mere
adjuncts
to
the
manufacturing
districts
,

formed
a
sort
of
minor
manufacturing
districts
themselves
.
houses
were
allowed
to
fall
into
decay

ruin

cut
down
for
the
sake
of
the
few
shillings
which
the
poor
sticks
would
fetch
;
the
building
became
inexpressibly
mean
and
hideous
.
labour
was
scarce
;
but
wages
fell
nevertheless

all
the
small
country
arts
of
life

once
added
to

little
pleasures

lost

the

which
passed
through
the
hands
of
the
husbandmen
never
got
so
far
as
their
mouths
.
incredible
shabbiness
and
niggardly
pinching
reigned
over
the
fields
and
acres
which
,
in
spite
of
the
rude
and
careless
husbandry
of
the
times

in
these
matters
took
place
very

flung
themselves
upon

prey

in
a
very

the

of
course
,
this
invasion
of
the
country
was
awkward
to
deal
with
,
and
would
have
created
much
misery
,
if
the
folk
had
still
been
under
the
bondage
of
class
monopoly
.
but
as
it
was
,
things
soon
righted
themselves
.
people
found
out
what
they
were
fit
for
,
and
gave
up
attempting
to
push
themselves
into
occupations
in
which
they
must
needs
fail
.
the
town
invaded
the
country
;
but
the
invaders
,
like
the
warlike
invaders
of
early
days
,
yielded
to
the
influence
of
their
surroundings
,
and
became
country
people
;
and
in
their
turn
,
as
they
became
more
numerous
than
the
townsmen
,
influenced
them
also
;
so
that
the
difference
between
town
and
country
grew
less
and
less
;
and
it
was
indeed
this
world
of
the
country
vivified
by
the
thought
and
briskness
of
town
-
bred
folk
which
has
produced
that
happy
and
leisurely
but
eager
life
of
which
you
have
had
a
first
taste
.
again
i
say
,
many
blunders
were
made
,
but
we
have
had
time
to
set
them
right
.
much
was
left
for
the
men
of
my
earlier
life
to
deal
with
.
the
crude
ideas
of
the
first
half
of
the
twentieth
century
,
when
men
were
still
oppressed
by
the
fear
of
poverty
,
and
did
not
look
enough
to
the
present
pleasure
of
ordinary
daily
life
,
spoilt
a
great
deal
of
what
the
commercial
age
had
left
us
of
external
beauty
:
and
i
admit
that
it
was
but
slowly
that
men
recovered
from
the
injuries
that
they
inflicted
on
themselves
even
after
they
became
free
.
but
slowly
as
the
recovery
came
,
it
did
come
;
and
the
more
you
see
of
us
,
the
clearer
it
will
be
to
you
that
we
are
happy
.
that
we
live
amidst
beauty
without
any
fear
of
becoming
effeminate
;
that
we
have
plenty
to
do
,
and
on
the
whole
enjoy
doing
it
.
what
more
can
we
ask
of
life
?

england
was
once
a
country
of
clearings
amongst
the
woods
and
wastes
,
with
a
few
towns
interspersed
,

were
fortresses
for
the
feudal
army
,
markets
for
the
folk
,
gathering
places
for
the
craftsmen

it
then
became
a
country

huge
and
foul
workshops
and
fouler
gambling

dens

surrounded
by
an
ill

kept
,
poverty
-
stricken
farm
,
pillaged
by
the
masters
of
the

is
now
a

nothing
is

nothing
is

the

up

down
the

trim

neat

pretty

should
be

large
scale

to
carry
with
it
the
