in
the
middle
of
a
shadowless
square
of
moonlight
shining
on
a
smooth
and
level
expanse
of
young
rice
-
shoots
a
little
shelter
-
hut
perched
on
high
posts
the
pile
of
brushwood
near
by
and
the
glowing
embers
of
a
fire
with
a
man
stretched
before
it
seemed
very
small
and
as
if
lost
in
the
pale
green
iridescence
reflected
from
the
ground
on
three
sides
of
the
clearing
appearing
very
far
away
in
the
deceptive
light
the
big
trees
of
the
forest
lashed
together
with
manifold
bonds
by
a
mass
of
tangled
creepers
looked
down
at
the
growing
young
life
at
their
feet
with
the
sombre
resignation
of
giants
that
had
lost
faith
in
their
strength
and
in
the
midst
of
them
the
merciless
creepers
clung
to
the
big
trunks
in
cable
-
like
coils
leaped
from
tree
to
tree
hung
in
thorny
festoons
from
the
lower
boughs
and
sending
slender
tendrils
on
high
to
seek
out
the
smallest
branches
carried
death
to
their
victims
in
an
exulting
riot
of
silent
destruction
on
the
fourth
side
following
the
curve
of
the
bank
of
that
branch
of
the
pantai
that
formed
the
only
access
to
the
clearing
ran
a
black
line
of
young
trees
bushes
and
thick
second
growth
unbroken
save
for
a
small
gap
chopped
out
in
one
place
at
that
gap
began
the
narrow
footpath
leading
from
the
water
'
s
edge
to
the
grass
-
built
shelter
used
by
the
night
watchers
when
the
ripening
crop
had
to
be
protected
from
the
wild
pigs
the
pathway
ended
at
the
foot
of
the
piles
on
which
the
hut
was
built
in
a
circular
space
covered
with
ashes
and
bits
of
burnt
wood
in
the
middle
of
that
space
by
the
dim
fire
lay
dain
he
turned
over
on
his
side
with
an
impatient
sigh
and
pillowing
his
head
on
his
bent
arm
lay
quietly
with
his
face
to
the
dying
fire
the
glowing
embers
shone
redly
in
a
small
circle
throwing
a
gleam
into
his
wide
-
open
eyes
and
at
every
deep
breath
the
fine
white
ash
of
bygone
fires
rose
in
a
light
cloud
before
his
parted
lips
and
danced
away
from
the
warm
glow
into
the
moonbeams
pouring
down
upon
bulangi
'
s
clearing
his
body
was
weary
with
the
exertion
of
the
past
few
days
his
mind
more
weary
still
with
the
strain
of
solitary
waiting
for
his
fate
never
before
had
he
felt
so
helpless
he
had
heard
the
report
of
the
gun
fired
on
board
the
launch
and
he
knew
that
his
life
was
in
untrustworthy
hands
and
that
his
enemies
were
very
near
during
the
slow
hours
of
the
afternoon
he
roamed
about
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
or
hiding
in
the
bushes
watched
the
creek
with
unquiet
eyes
for
some
sign
of
danger
he
feared
not
death
yet
he
desired
ardently
to
live
for
life
to
him
was
nina
she
had
promised
to
come
to
follow
him
to
share
his
danger
and
his
splendour
but
with
her
by
his
side
he
cared
not
for
danger
and
without
her
there
could
be
no
splendour
and
no
joy
in
existence
crouching
in
his
shady
hiding
-
place
he
closed
his
eyes
trying
to
evoke
the
gracious
and
charming
image
of
the
white
figure
that
for
him
was
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
life
with
eyes
shut
tight
his
teeth
hard
set
he
tried
in
a
great
effort
of
passionate
will
to
keep
his
hold
on
that
vision
of
supreme
delight
in
vain
his
heart
grew
heavy
as
the
figure
of
nina
faded
away
to
be
replaced
by
another
vision
this
time
a
vision
of
armed
men
of
angry
faces
of
glittering
arms
and
he
seemed
to
hear
the
hum
of
excited
and
triumphant
voices
as
they
discovered
him
in
his
hiding
-
place
startled
by
the
vividness
of
his
fancy
he
would
open
his
eyes
and
leaping
out
into
the
sunlight
resume
his
aimless
wanderings
around
the
clearing
as
he
skirted
in
his
weary
march
the
edge
of
the
forest
he
glanced
now
and
then
into
its
dark
shade
so
enticing
in
its
deceptive
appearance
of
coolness
so
repellent
with
its
unrelieved
gloom
where
lay
entombed
and
rotting
countless
generations
of
trees
and
where
their
successors
stood
as
if
mourning
in
dark
green
foliage
immense
and
helpless
awaiting
their
turn
only
the
parasites
seemed
to
live
there
in
a
sinuous
rush
upwards
into
the
air
and
sunshine
feeding
on
the
dead
and
the
dying
alike
and
crowning
their
victims
with
pink
and
blue
flowers
that
gleamed
amongst
the
boughs
incongruous
and
cruel
like
a
strident
and
mocking
note
in
the
solemn
harmony
of
the
doomed
trees
a
man
could
hide
there
thought
dain
as
he
approached
a
place
where
the
creepers
had
been
torn
and
hacked
into
an
archway
that
might
have
been
the
beginning
of
a
path
as
he
bent
down
to
look
through
he
heard
angry
grunting
and
a
sounder
of
wild
pig
crashed
away
in
the
undergrowth
an
acrid
smell
of
damp
earth
and
of
decaying
leaves
took
him
by
the
throat
and
he
drew
back
with
a
scared
face
as
if
he
had
been
touched
by
the
breath
of
death
itself
the
very
air
seemed
dead
in
there
heavy
and
stagnating
poisoned
with
the
corruption
of
countless
ages
he
went
on
staggering
on
his
way
urged
by
the
nervous
restlessness
that
made
him
feel
tired
yet
caused
him
to
loathe
the
very
idea
of
immobility
and
repose
was
he
a
wild
man
to
hide
in
the
woods
and
perhaps
be
killed
there
in
the
darkness
where
there
was
no
room
to
breathe
he
would
wait
for
his
enemies
in
the
sunlight
where
he
could
see
the
sky
and
feel
the
breeze
he
knew
how
a
malay
chief
should
die
the
sombre
and
desperate
fury
that
peculiar
inheritance
of
his
race
took
possession
of
him
and
he
glared
savagely
across
the
clearing
towards
the
gap
in
the
bushes
by
the
riverside
they
would
come
from
there
in
imagination
he
saw
them
now
he
saw
the
bearded
faces
and
the
white
jackets
of
the
officers
the
light
on
the
levelled
barrels
of
the
rifles
what
is
the
bravery
of
the
greatest
warrior
before
the
firearms
in
the
hand
of
a
slave
he
would
walk
toward
them
with
a
smiling
face
with
his
hands
held
out
in
a
sign
of
submission
till
he
was
very
near
them
he
would
speak
friendly
words
come
nearer
yet
yet
nearer
so
near
that
they
could
touch
him
with
their
hands
and
stretch
them
out
to
make
him
a
captive
that
would
be
the
time
with
a
shout
and
a
leap
he
would
be
in
the
midst
of
them
kriss
in
hand
killing
killing
killing
and
would
die
with
the
shouts
of
his
enemies
in
his
ears
their
warm
blood
spurting
before
his
eyes
carried
away
by
his
excitement
he
snatched
the
kriss
hidden
in
his
sarong
and
drawing
a
long
breath
rushed
forward
struck
at
the
empty
air
and
fell
on
his
face
he
lay
as
if
stunned
in
the
sudden
reaction
from
his
exaltation
thinking
that
even
if
he
died
thus
gloriously
it
would
have
to
be
before
he
saw
nina
better
so
if
he
saw
her
again
he
felt
that
death
would
be
too
terrible
with
horror
he
the
descendant
of
rajahs
and
of
conquerors
had
to
face
the
doubt
of
his
own
bravery
his
desire
of
life
tormented
him
in
a
paroxysm
of
agonising
remorse
he
had
not
the
courage
to
stir
a
limb
he
had
lost
faith
in
himself
and
there
was
nothing
else
in
him
of
what
makes
a
man
the
suffering
remained
for
it
is
ordered
that
it
should
abide
in
the
human
body
even
to
the
last
breath
and
fear
remained
dimly
he
could
look
into
the
depths
of
his
passionate
love
see
its
strength
and
its
weakness
and
felt
afraid
the
sun
went
down
slowly
the
shadow
of
the
western
forest
marched
over
the
clearing
covered
the
man
'
s
scorched
shoulders
with
its
cool
mantle
and
went
on
hurriedly
to
mingle
with
the
shadows
of
other
forests
on
the
eastern
side
the
sun
lingered
for
a
while
amongst
the
light
tracery
of
the
higher
branches
as
if
in
friendly
reluctance
to
abandon
the
body
stretched
in
the
green
paddy
-
field
then
dain
revived
by
the
cool
of
the
evening
breeze
sat
up
and
stared
round
him
as
he
did
so
the
sun
dipped
sharply
as
if
ashamed
of
being
detected
in
a
sympathising
attitude
and
the
clearing
which
during
the
day
was
all
light
became
suddenly
all
darkness
where
the
fire
gleamed
like
an
eye
dain
walked
slowly
towards
the
creek
and
divesting
himself
of
his
torn
sarong
his
only
garment
entered
the
water
cautiously
he
had
had
nothing
to
eat
that
day
and
had
not
dared
show
himself
in
daylight
by
the
water
-
side
to
drink
now
as
he
swam
silently
he
swallowed
a
few
mouthfuls
of
water
that
lapped
about
his
lips
this
did
him
good
and
he
walked
with
greater
confidence
in
himself
and
others
as
he
returned
towards
the
fire
had
he
been
betrayed
by
lakamba
all
would
have
been
over
by
this
he
made
up
a
big
blaze
and
while
it
lasted
dried
himself
and
then
lay
down
by
the
embers
he
could
not
sleep
but
he
felt
a
great
numbness
in
all
his
limbs
his
restlessness
was
gone
and
he
was
content
to
lay
still
measuring
the
time
by
watching
the
stars
that
rose
in
endless
succession
above
the
forests
while
the
slight
puffs
of
wind
under
the
cloudless
sky
seemed
to
fan
their
twinkle
into
a
greater
brightness
dreamily
he
assured
himself
over
and
over
again
that
she
would
come
till
the
certitude
crept
into
his
heart
and
filled
him
with
a
great
peace
yes
when
the
next
day
broke
they
would
be
together
on
the
great
blue
sea
that
was
like
life
away
from
the
forests
that
were
like
death
he
murmured
the
name
of
nina
into
the
silent
space
with
a
tender
smile
this
seemed
to
break
the
spell
of
stillness
and
far
away
by
the
creek
a
frog
croaked
loudly
as
if
in
answer
a
chorus
of
loud
roars
and
plaintive
calls
rose
from
the
mud
along
the
line
of
bushes
he
laughed
heartily
doubtless
it
was
their
love
-
song
he
felt
affectionate
towards
the
frogs
and
listened
pleased
with
the
noisy
life
near
him
when
the
moon
peeped
above
the
trees
he
felt
the
old
impatience
and
the
old
restlessness
steal
over
him
why
was
she
so
late
true
it
was
a
long
way
to
come
with
a
single
paddle
with
what
skill
and
what
endurance
could
those
small
hands
manage
a
heavy
paddle
it
was
very
wonderful
such
small
hands
such
soft
little
palms
that
knew
how
to
touch
his
cheek
with
a
feel
lighter
than
the
fanning
of
a
butterfly
'
s
wing
wonderful
he
lost
himself
lovingly
in
the
contemplation
of
this
tremendous
mystery
and
when
he
looked
at
the
moon
again
it
had
risen
a
hand
'
s
breadth
above
the
trees
would
she
come
he
forced
himself
to
lay
still
overcoming
the
impulse
to
rise
and
rush
round
the
clearing
again
he
turned
this
way
and
that
at
last
quivering
with
the
effort
he
lay
on
his
back
and
saw
her
face
among
the
stars
looking
down
on
him
the
croaking
of
frogs
suddenly
ceased
with
the
watchfulness
of
a
hunted
man
dain
sat
up
listening
anxiously
and
heard
several
splashes
in
the
water
as
the
frogs
took
rapid
headers
into
the
creek
he
knew
that
they
had
been
alarmed
by
something
and
stood
up
suspicious
and
attentive
a
slight
grating
noise
then
the
dry
sound
as
of
two
pieces
of
wood
struck
against
each
other
somebody
was
about
to
land
he
took
up
an
armful
of
brushwood
and
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
path
held
it
over
the
embers
of
his
fire
he
waited
undecided
and
saw
something
gleam
amongst
the
bushes
then
a
white
figure
came
out
of
the
shadows
and
seemed
to
float
towards
him
in
the
pale
light
his
heart
gave
a
great
leap
and
stood
still
then
went
on
shaking
his
frame
in
furious
beats
he
dropped
the
brushwood
upon
the
glowing
coals
and
had
an
impression
of
shouting
her
name
of
rushing
to
meet
her
yet
he
emitted
no
sound
he
stirred
not
an
inch
but
he
stood
silent
and
motionless
like
chiselled
bronze
under
the
moonlight
that
streamed
over
his
naked
shoulders
as
he
stood
still
fighting
with
his
breath
as
if
bereft
of
his
senses
by
the
intensity
of
his
delight
she
walked
up
to
him
with
quick
resolute
steps
and
with
the
appearance
of
one
about
to
leap
from
a
dangerous
height
threw
both
her
arms
round
his
neck
with
a
sudden
gesture
a
small
blue
gleam
crept
amongst
the
dry
branches
and
the
crackling
of
reviving
fire
was
the
only
sound
as
they
faced
each
other
in
the
speechless
emotion
of
that
meeting
then
the
dry
fuel
caught
at
once
and
a
bright
hot
flame
shot
upwards
in
a
blaze
as
high
as
their
heads
and
in
its
light
they
saw
each
other
'
s
eyes
neither
of
them
spoke
he
was
regaining
his
senses
in
a
slight
tremor
that
ran
upwards
along
his
rigid
body
and
hung
about
his
trembling
lips
she
drew
back
her
head
and
fastened
her
eyes
on
his
in
one
of
those
long
looks
that
are
a
woman
'
s
most
terrible
weapon
a
look
that
is
more
stirring
than
the
closest
touch
and
more
dangerous
than
the
thrust
of
a
dagger
because
it
also
whips
the
soul
out
of
the
body
but
leaves
the
body
alive
and
helpless
to
be
swayed
here
and
there
by
the
capricious
tempests
of
passion
and
desire
a
look
that
enwraps
the
whole
body
and
that
penetrates
into
the
innermost
recesses
of
the
being
bringing
terrible
defeat
in
the
delirious
uplifting
of
accomplished
conquest
it
has
the
same
meaning
for
the
man
of
the
forests
and
the
sea
as
for
the
man
threading
the
paths
of
the
more
dangerous
wilderness
of
houses
and
streets
men
that
had
felt
in
their
breasts
the
awful
exultation
such
a
look
awakens
become
mere
things
of
to
-
day
which
is
paradise
forget
yesterday
which
was
suffering
care
not
for
to
-
morrow
which
may
be
perdition
they
wish
to
live
under
that
look
for
ever
it
is
the
look
of
woman
'
s
surrender
he
understood
and
as
if
suddenly
released
from
his
invisible
bonds
fell
at
her
feet
with
a
shout
of
joy
and
embracing
her
knees
hid
his
head
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
murmuring
disjointed
words
of
gratitude
and
love
never
before
had
he
felt
so
proud
as
now
when
at
the
feet
of
that
woman
that
half
belonged
to
his
enemies
her
fingers
played
with
his
hair
in
an
absent
-
minded
caress
as
she
stood
absorbed
in
thought
the
thing
was
done
her
mother
was
right
the
man
was
her
slave
as
she
glanced
down
at
his
kneeling
form
she
felt
a
great
pitying
tenderness
for
that
man
she
was
used
to
call
even
in
her
thoughts
the
master
of
life
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
looked
sadly
at
the
southern
heavens
under
which
lay
the
path
of
their
lives
her
own
and
that
man
'
s
at
her
feet
did
he
not
say
himself
is
that
she
was
the
light
of
his
life
she
would
be
his
light
and
his
wisdom
she
would
be
his
greatness
and
his
strength
yet
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
all
men
she
would
be
above
all
his
only
and
lasting
weakness
a
very
woman
in
the
sublime
vanity
of
her
kind
she
was
thinking
already
of
moulding
a
god
from
the
clay
at
her
feet
a
god
for
others
to
worship
she
was
content
to
see
him
as
he
was
now
and
to
feel
him
quiver
at
the
slightest
touch
of
her
light
fingers
and
while
her
eyes
looked
sadly
at
the
southern
stars
a
faint
smile
seemed
to
be
playing
about
her
firm
lips
who
can
tell
in
the
fitful
light
of
a
camp
fire
it
might
have
been
a
smile
of
triumph
or
of
conscious
power
or
of
tender
pity
or
perhaps
of
love
she
spoke
softly
to
him
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
putting
his
arm
round
her
in
quiet
consciousness
of
his
ownership
she
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
with
a
sense
of
defiance
to
all
the
world
in
the
encircling
protection
of
that
arm
he
was
hers
with
all
his
qualities
and
all
his
faults
his
strength
and
his
courage
his
recklessness
and
his
daring
his
simple
wisdom
and
his
savage
cunning
all
were
hers
as
they
passed
together
out
of
the
red
light
of
the
fire
into
the
silver
shower
of
rays
that
fell
upon
the
clearing
he
bent
his
head
over
her
face
and
she
saw
in
his
eyes
the
dreamy
intoxication
of
boundless
felicity
from
the
close
touch
of
her
slight
figure
clasped
to
his
side
with
a
rhythmical
swing
of
their
bodies
they
walked
through
the
light
towards
the
outlying
shadows
of
the
forests
that
seemed
to
guard
their
happiness
in
solemn
immobility
their
forms
melted
in
the
play
of
light
and
shadow
at
the
foot
of
the
big
trees
but
the
murmur
of
tender
words
lingered
over
the
empty
clearing
grew
faint
and
died
out
a
sigh
as
of
immense
sorrow
passed
over
the
land
in
the
last
effort
of
the
dying
breeze
and
in
the
deep
silence
which
succeeded
the
earth
and
the
heavens
were
suddenly
hushed
up
in
the
mournful
contemplation
of
human
love
and
human
blindness
they
walked
slowly
back
to
the
fire
he
made
for
her
a
seat
out
of
the
dry
branches
and
throwing
himself
down
at
her
feet
lay
his
head
in
her
lap
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
dreamy
delight
of
the
passing
hour
their
voices
rose
and
fell
tender
or
animated
as
they
spoke
of
their
love
and
of
their
future
she
with
a
few
skilful
words
spoken
from
time
to
time
guided
his
thoughts
and
he
let
his
happiness
flow
in
a
stream
of
talk
passionate
and
tender
grave
or
menacing
according
to
the
mood
which
she
evoked
he
spoke
to
her
of
his
own
island
where
the
gloomy
forests
and
the
muddy
rivers
were
unknown
he
spoke
of
its
terraced
fields
of
the
murmuring
clear
rills
of
sparkling
water
that
flowed
down
the
sides
of
great
mountains
bringing
life
to
the
land
and
joy
to
its
tillers
and
he
spoke
also
of
the
mountain
peak
that
rising
lonely
above
the
belt
of
trees
knew
the
secrets
of
the
passing
clouds
and
was
the
dwelling
-
place
of
the
mysterious
spirit
of
his
race
of
the
guardian
genius
of
his
house
he
spoke
of
vast
horizons
swept
by
fierce
winds
that
whistled
high
above
the
summits
of
burning
mountains
he
spoke
of
his
forefathers
that
conquered
ages
ago
the
island
of
which
he
was
to
be
the
future
ruler
and
then
as
in
her
interest
she
brought
her
face
nearer
to
his
he
touching
lightly
the
thick
tresses
of
her
long
hair
felt
a
sudden
impulse
to
speak
to
her
of
the
sea
he
loved
so
well
and
he
told
her
of
its
never
-
ceasing
voice
to
which
he
had
listened
as
a
child
wondering
at
its
hidden
meaning
that
no
living
man
has
penetrated
yet
of
its
enchanting
glitter
of
its
senseless
and
capricious
fury
how
its
surface
was
for
ever
changing
and
yet
always
enticing
while
its
depths
were
for
ever
the
same
cold
and
cruel
and
full
of
the
wisdom
of
destroyed
life
he
told
her
how
it
held
men
slaves
of
its
charm
for
a
lifetime
and
then
regardless
of
their
devotion
swallowed
them
up
angry
at
their
fear
of
its
mystery
which
it
would
never
disclose
not
even
to
those
that
loved
it
most
while
he
talked
nina
'
s
head
had
been
gradually
sinking
lower
and
her
face
almost
touched
his
now
her
hair
was
over
his
eyes
her
breath
was
on
his
forehead
her
arms
were
about
his
body
no
two
beings
could
be
closer
to
each
other
yet
she
guessed
rather
than
understood
the
meaning
of
his
last
words
that
came
out
after
a
slight
hesitation
in
a
faint
murmur
dying
out
imperceptibly
into
a
profound
and
significant
silence
the
sea
o
nina
is
like
a
woman
'
s
heart
she
closed
his
lips
with
a
sudden
kiss
and
answered
in
a
steady
voice
but
to
the
men
that
have
no
fear
o
master
of
my
life
the
sea
is
ever
true
over
their
heads
a
film
of
dark
thread
-
like
clouds
looking
like
immense
cobwebs
drifting
under
the
stars
darkened
the
sky
with
the
presage
of
the
coming
thunderstorm
from
the
invisible
hills
the
first
distant
rumble
of
thunder
came
in
a
prolonged
roll
which
after
tossing
about
from
hill
to
hill
lost
itself
in
the
forests
of
the
pantai
dain
and
nina
stood
up
and
the
former
looked
at
the
sky
uneasily
it
is
time
for
babalatchi
to
be
here
he
said
the
night
is
more
than
half
gone
our
road
is
long
and
a
bullet
travels
quicker
than
the
best
canoe
he
will
be
here
before
the
moon
is
hidden
behind
the
clouds
said
nina
i
heard
a
splash
in
the
water
she
added
did
you
hear
it
too
alligator
answered
dain
shortly
with
a
careless
glance
towards
the
creek
the
darker
the
night
he
continued
the
shorter
will
be
our
road
for
then
we
could
keep
in
the
current
of
the
main
stream
but
if
it
is
light
even
no
more
than
now
we
must
follow
the
small
channels
of
sleeping
water
with
nothing
to
help
our
paddles
dain
interposed
nina
earnestly
it
was
no
alligator
i
heard
the
bushes
rustling
near
the
landing
-
place
yes
said
dain
after
listening
awhile
it
cannot
be
babalatchi
who
would
come
in
a
big
war
canoe
and
openly
those
that
are
coming
whoever
they
are
do
not
wish
to
make
much
noise
but
you
have
heard
and
now
i
can
see
he
went
on
quickly
it
is
but
one
man
stand
behind
me
nina
if
he
is
a
friend
he
is
welcome
if
he
is
an
enemy
you
shall
see
him
die
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
kriss
and
awaited
the
approach
of
his
unexpected
visitor
the
fire
was
burning
very
low
and
small
clouds
precursors
of
the
storm
crossed
the
face
of
the
moon
in
rapid
succession
and
their
flying
shadows
darkened
the
clearing
he
could
not
make
out
who
the
man
might
be
but
he
felt
uneasy
at
the
steady
advance
of
the
tall
figure
walking
on
the
path
with
a
heavy
tread
and
hailed
it
with
a
command
to
stop
the
man
stopped
at
some
little
distance
and
dain
expected
him
to
speak
but
all
he
could
hear
was
his
deep
breathing
through
a
break
in
the
flying
clouds
a
sudden
and
fleeting
brightness
descended
upon
the
clearing
before
the
darkness
closed
in
again
dain
saw
a
hand
holding
some
glittering
object
extended
towards
him
heard
nina
'
s
cry
of
father
and
in
an
instant
the
girl
was
between
him
and
almayer
'
s
revolver
nina
'
s
loud
cry
woke
up
the
echoes
of
the
sleeping
woods
and
the
three
stood
still
as
if
waiting
for
the
return
of
silence
before
they
would
give
expression
to
their
various
feelings
at
the
appearance
of
nina
almayer
'
s
arm
fell
by
his
side
and
he
made
a
step
forward
dain
pushed
the
girl
gently
aside
am
i
a
wild
beast

try
to

the

some
brushwood
on

went
on
speaking
to

i
watch
my
white
friend
lest
harm
should
come
to
you
or
to
me
o
delight
of
my
heart

ground
his
teeth
and
raised
his
arm
again
with
a
quick
bound
dain

at
his
side
there
was
a
short
scuffle
during
which
one
chamber
of
the
revolver
went
off
harmlessly
then
the
weapon
wrenched
out
of
almayer
'
s
hand
whirled
through
the
air
and
fell
in
the
bushes
the
two
men
stood
close
together
breathing
hard
the
replenished
fire
threw
out
an
unsteady
circle
of
light
and
shone
on
the
terrified
face
of
nina
who
looked
at
them
with
outstretched
hands
dain
she
cried
out
warningly
dain
he
waved
his
hand
towards
her
in
a
reassuring
gesture
and
turning
to
almayer
said
with
great
courtesy
now
we
may
talk
tuan
it
is
easy
to
send
out
death
but
can
your
wisdom
recall
the
life
she
might
have
been
harmed
he
continued
indicating
nina
your
hand
shook
much
for
myself
i
was
not
afraid
nina
exclaimed
almayer
come
to
me
at
once
what
is
this
sudden
madness
what
bewitched
you
come
to
your
father
and
together
we
shall
try
to
forget
this
horrible
nightmare
he
opened
his
arms
with
the
certitude
of
clasping
her
to
his
breast
in
another
second
she
did
not
move
as
it
dawned
upon
him
that
she
did
not
mean
to
obey
he
felt
a
deadly
cold
creep
into
his
heart
and
pressing
the
palms
of
his
hands
to
his
temples
he
looked
down
on
the
ground
in
mute
despair
dain
took
nina
by
the
arm
and
led
her
towards
her
father
speak
to
him
in
the
language
of
his
people
he
said
he
is
grieving
as
who
would
not
grieve
at
losing
thee
my
pearl
speak
to
him
the
last
words
he
shall
hear
spoken
by
that
voice
which
must
be
very
sweet
to
him
but
is
all
my
life
to
me
he
released
her
and
stepping
back
a
few
paces
out
of
the
circle
of
light
stood
in
the
darkness
looking
at
them
with
calm
interest
the
reflection
of
a
distant
flash
of
lightning
lit
up
the
clouds
over
their
heads
and
was
followed
after
a
short
interval
by
the
faint
rumble
of
thunder
which
mingled
with
almayer
'
s
voice
as
he
began
to
speak
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing
do
you
know
what
is
waiting
for
you
if
you
follow
that
man
have
you
no
pity
for
yourself
do
you
know
that
you
shall
be
at
first
his
plaything
and
then
a
scorned
slave
a
drudge
and
a
servant
of
some
new
fancy
of
that
man
she
raised
her
hand
to
stop
him
and
turning
her
head
slightly
asked
you
hear
this
dain
is
it
true
by
all
the
gods
came
the
impassioned
answer
from
the
darkness
by
heaven
and
earth
by
my
head
and
thine
i
swear
this
is
a
white
man
'
s
lie
i
have
delivered
my
soul
into
your
hands
for
ever
i
breathe
with
your
breath
i
see
with
your
eyes
i
think
with
your
mind
and
i
take
you
into
my
heart
for
ever
you
thief
shouted
the
exasperated
almayer
a
deep
silence
succeeded
this
outburst
then
the
voice
of
dain
was
heard
again
nay
tuan
he
said
in
a
gentle
tone
that
is
not
true
also
the
girl
came
of
her
own
will
i
have
done
no
more
but
to
show
her
my
love
like
a
man
she
heard
the
cry
of
my
heart
and
she
came
and
the
dowry
i
have
given
to
the
woman
you
call
your
wife
almayer
groaned
in
his
extremity
of
rage
and
shame
nina
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
his
shoulder
and
the
contact
light
as
the
touch
of
a
falling
leaf
seemed
to
calm
him
he
spoke
quickly
and
in
english
this
time
tell
me
he
said
tell
me
what
have
they
done
to
you
your
mother
and
that
man
what
made
you
give
yourself
up
to
that
savage
for
he
is
a
savage
between
him
and
you
there
is
a
barrier
that
nothing
can
remove
i
can
see
in
your
eyes
the
look
of
those
who
commit
suicide
when
they
are
mad
you
are
mad
do
not
smile
it
breaks
my
heart
if
i
were
to
see
you
drowning
before
my
eyes
and
i
without
the
power
to
help
you
i
could
not
suffer
a
greater
torment
have
you
forgotten
the
teaching
of
so
many
years
no
she
interrupted
i
remember
it
well
i
remember
how
it
ended
also
scorn
for
scorn
contempt
for
contempt
hate
for
hate
i
am
not
of
your
race
between
your
people
and
me
there
is
also
a
barrier
that
nothing
can
remove
you
ask
why
i
want
to
go
and
i
ask
you
why
i
should
stay
he
staggered
as
if
struck
in
the
face
but
with
a
quick
unhesitating
grasp
she
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
steadied
him
why
you
should
stay
he
repeated
slowly
in
a
dazed
manner
and
stopped
short
astounded
at
the
completeness
of
his
misfortune
you
told
me
yesterday
she
went
on
again
that
i
could
not
understand
or
see
your
love
for
me
it
is
so
how
can
i
no
two
human
beings
understand
each
other
they
can
understand
but
their
own
voices
you
wanted
me
to
dream
your
dreams
to
see
your
own
visions
the
visions
of
life
amongst
the
white
faces
of
those
who
cast
me
out
from
their
midst
in
angry
contempt
but
while
you
spoke
i
listened
to
the
voice
of
my
own
self
then
this
man
came
and
all
was
still
there
was
only
the
murmur
of
his
love
you
call
him
a
savage
what
do
you
call
my
mother
your
wife
nina
cried
almayer
take
your
eyes
off
my
face
she
looked
down
directly
but
continued
speaking
only
a
little
above
a
whisper
in
time
she
went
on
both
our
voices
that
man
'
s
and
mine
spoke
together
in
a
sweetness
that
was
intelligible
to
our
ears
only
you
were
speaking
of
gold
then
but
our
ears
were
filled
with
the
song
of
our
love
and
we
did
not
hear
you
then
i
found
that
we
could
see
through
each
other
'
s
eyes
that
he
saw
things
that
nobody
but
myself
and
he
could
see
we
entered
a
land
where
no
one
could
follow
us
and
least
of
all
you
then
i
began
to
live
she
paused
almayer
sighed
deeply
with
her
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
ground
she
began
speaking
again
and
i
mean
to
live
i
mean
to
follow
him
i
have
been
rejected
with
scorn
by
the
white
people
and
now
i
am
a
malay
he
took
me
in
his
arms
he
laid
his
life
at
my
feet
he
is
brave
he
will
be
powerful
and
i
hold
his
bravery
and
his
strength
in
my
hand
and
i
shall
make
him
great
his
name
shall
be
remembered
long
after
both
our
bodies
are
laid
in
the
dust
i
love
you
no
less
than
i
did
before
but
i
shall
never
leave
him
for
without
him
i
cannot
live
if
he
understood
what
you
have
said
answered
almayer
scornfully
he
must
be
highly
flattered
you
want
him
as
a
tool
for
some
incomprehensible
ambition
of
yours
enough
nina
if
you
do
not
go
down
at
once
to
the
creek
where
ali
is
waiting
with
my
canoe
i
shall
tell
him
to
return
to
the
settlement
and
bring
the
dutch
officers
here
you
cannot
escape
from
this
clearing
for
i
have
cast
adrift
your
canoe
if
the
dutch
catch
this
hero
of
yours
they
will
hang
him
as
sure
as
i
stand
here
now
go
he
made
a
step
towards
his
daughter
and
laid
hold
of
her
by
the
shoulder
his
other
hand
pointing
down
the
path
to
the
landing
-
place
beware
exclaimed
dain
this
woman
belongs
to
me
nina
wrenched
herself
free
and
looked
straight
at
almayer
'
s
angry
face
no
i
will
not
go
she
said
with
desperate
energy
if
he
dies
i
shall
die
too
you
die
said
almayer
contemptuously
oh
no
you
shall
live
a
life
of
lies
and
deception
till
some
other
vagabond
comes
along
to
sing
how
did
you
say
that
the
song
of
love
to
you
make
up
your
mind
quickly
he
waited
for
a
while
and
then
added
meaningly
shall
i
call
out
to
ali
call
out
she
answered
in
malay
you
that
cannot
be
true
to
your
own
countrymen
only
a
few
days
ago
you
were
selling
the
powder
for
their
destruction
now
you
want
to
give
up
to
them
the
man
that
yesterday
you
called
your
friend
oh
dain
she
said
turning
towards
the
motionless
but
attentive
figure
in
the
darkness
instead
of
bringing
you
life
i
bring
you
death
for
he
will
betray
unless
i
leave
you
for
ever
dain
came
into
the
circle
of
light
and
throwing
his
arm
around
nina
'
s
neck
whispered
in
her
ear
i
can
kill
him
where
he
stands
before
a
sound
can
pass
his
lips
for
you
it
is
to
say
yes
or
no
babalatchi
cannot
be
far
now
he
straightened
himself
up
taking
his
arm
off
her
shoulder
and
confronted
almayer
who
looked
at
them
both
with
an
expression
of
concentrated
fury
no
she
cried
clinging
to
dain
in
wild
alarm
no
kill
me
then
perhaps
he
will
let
you
go
you
do
not
know
the
mind
of
a
white
man
he
would
rather
see
me
dead
than
standing
where
i
am
forgive
me
your
slave
but
you
must
not
she
fell
at
his
feet
sobbing
violently
and
repeating
kill
me
kill
me
i
want
you
alive
said
almayer
speaking
also
in
malay
with
sombre
calmness
you
go
or
he
hangs
will
you
obey
dain
shook
nina
off
and
making
a
sudden
lunge
struck
almayer
full
in
the
chest
with
the
handle
of
his
kriss
keeping
the
point
towards
himself
hai
look
it
was
easy
for
me
to
turn
the
point
the
other
way
he
said
in
his
even
voice
go
tuan
putih
he
added
with
dignity
i
give
you
your
life
my
life
and
her
life
i
am
the
slave
of
this
woman
'
s
desire
and
she
wills
it
so
there
was
not
a
glimmer
of
light
in
the
sky
now
and
the
tops
of
the
trees
were
as
invisible
as
their
trunks
being
lost
in
the
mass
of
clouds
that
hung
low
over
the
woods
the
clearing
and
the
river
every
outline
had
disappeared
in
the
intense
blackness
that
seemed
to
have
destroyed
everything
but
space
only
the
fire
glimmered
like
a
star
forgotten
in
this
annihilation
of
all
visible
things
and
nothing
was
heard
after
dain
ceased
speaking
but
the
sobs
of
nina
whom
he
held
in
his
arms
kneeling
beside
the
fire
almayer
stood
looking
down
at
them
in
gloomy
thoughtfulness
as
he
was
opening
his
lips
to
speak
they
were
startled
by
a
cry
of
warning
by
the
riverside
followed
by
the
splash
of
many
paddles
and
the
sound
of
voices
babalatchi
shouted
dain
lifting
up
nina
as
he
got
upon
his
feet
quickly
ada
ada
came
the
answer
from
the
panting
statesman
who
ran
up
the
path
and
stood
amongst
them
run
to
my
canoe
he
said
to
dain
excitedly
without
taking
any
notice
of
almayer
run
we
must
go
that
woman
has
told
them
all
what
woman
asked
dain
looking
at
nina
just
then
there
was
only
one
woman
in
the
whole
world
for
him
the
she
-
dog
with
white
teeth
the
seven
times
accursed
slave
of
bulangi
she
yelled
at
abdulla
'
s
gate
till
she
woke
up
all
sambir
now
the
white
officers
are
coming
guided
by
her
and
reshid
if
you
want
to
live
do
not
look
at
me
but
go
how

almayer
oh

what

how
i
know
i

only

eye
but
i
saw

and
in
his
campong
as
we
were
paddling
past
i

and
while
we
lay
under
the
bank
i
have
heard
the
messengers
sent
out
to
the
white
men

said
almayer
addressing

while
babalatchi
stamped
with
impatience
muttering
run

steadily
i
will
not
go
to
no

this
woman

kill
me
and

clasped

close
looking
at
her
tenderly
and
whispered

he
picked
up
his
staff
and
turning
to
go
looked
at
dain
as
if
offering
him
his
last
chance
of
escape
but
dain
'
s
face
was
hidden
amongst
nina
'
s
black
tresses
and
he
did
not
see
this
last
appealing
glance
babalatchi
vanished
in
the
darkness
shortly
after
his
disappearance
they
heard
the
war
canoe
leave
the
landing
-
place
in
the
swish
of
the
numerous
paddles
dipped
in
the
water
together
almost
at
the
same
time
ali
came
up
from
the
riverside
two
paddles
on
his
shoulder
our
canoe
is
hidden
up
the
creek
tuan
almayer
he
said
in
the
dense
bush
where
the
forest
comes
down
to
the
water
i
took
it
there
because
i
heard
from
babalatchi
'
s
paddlers
that
the
white
men
are
coming
here
wait
for
me
there
said
almayer
but
keep
the
canoe
hidden
he
remained
silent
listening
to
ali
'
s
footsteps
then
turned
to
nina
nina
he
said
sadly
will
you
have
no
pity
for
me
there
was
no
answer
she
did
not
even
turn
her
head
which
was
pressed
close
to
dain
'
s
breast
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
leave
them
and
stopped
by
the
dim
glow
of
the
burning
-
out
fire
he
saw
their
two
motionless
figures
the
woman
'
s
back
turned
to
him
with
the
long
black
hair
streaming
down
over
the
white
dress
and
dain
'
s
calm
face
looking
at
him
above
her
head
i
cannot
he
muttered
to
himself
after
a
long
pause
he
spoke
again
a
little
lower
but
in
an
unsteady
voice
it
would
be
too
great
a
disgrace
i
am
a
white
man
he
broke
down
completely
there
and
went
on
tearfully
i
am
a
white
man
and
of
good
family
very
good
family
he
repeated
weeping
bitterly
it
would
be
a
disgrace
all
over
the
islands
the
only
white
man
on
the
east
coast
no
it
cannot
be
white
men
finding
my
daughter
with
this
malay
my
daughter
he
cried
aloud
with
a
ring
of
despair
in
his
voice
he
recovered
his
composure
after
a
while
and
said
distinctly
i
will
never
forgive
you
nina
never
if
you
were
to
come
back
to
me
now
the
memory
of
this
night
would
poison
all
my
life
i
shall
try
to
forget
i
have
no
daughter
there
used
to
be
a
half
-
caste
woman
in
my
house

is
going

woman

the
island
at
the
mouth
of
the
river

come
with
me
he
led
the
way
following
the
bank
as
far
as
the
forest
ali
answered
to
his
call
and
pushing
their
way
through
the
dense
bush
they
stepped
into
the
canoe
hidden
under
the
overhanging
branches
dain
laid
nina
in
the
bottom
and
sat
holding
her
head
on
his
knees
almayer
and
ali
each
took
up
a
paddle
as
they
were
going
to
push
out
ali
hissed
warningly
all
listened
in
the
great
stillness
before
the
bursting
out
of
the
thunderstorm
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
oars
working
regularly
in
their
row
-
locks
the
sound
approached
steadily
and
dain
looking
through
the
branches
could
see
the
faint
shape
of
a
big
white
boat
a
woman
'
s
voice
said
in
a
cautious
tone
there
is
the
place
where
you
may
land
white
men
a
little
higher
there
the
boat
was
passing
them
so
close
in
the
narrow
creek
that
the
blades
of
the
long
oars
nearly
touched
the
canoe
way
enough
stand
by
to
jump
on
shore
he
is
alone
and
unarmed
was
the
quiet
order
in
a
man
'
s
voice
and
in
dutch
somebody
else
whispered
i
think
i
can
see
a
glimmer
of
a
fire
through
the
bush
and
then
the
boat
floated
past
them
disappearing
instantly
in
the
darkness
now
whispered
ali
eagerly
let
us
push
out
and
paddle
away
the
little
canoe
swung
into
the
stream
and
as
it
sprung
forward
in
response
to
the
vigorous
dig
of
the
paddles
they
could
hear
an
angry
shout
he
is
not
by
the
fire
spread
out
men
and
search
for
him
blue
lights
blazed
out
in
different
parts
of
the
clearing
and
the
shrill
voice
of
a
woman
cried
in
accents
of
rage
and
pain
too
late
o
senseless
white
men
he
has
escaped
that
is
the
place
said
dain
indicating
with
the
blade
of
his
paddle
a
small
islet
about
a
mile
ahead
of
the
canoe
that
is
the
place
where
babalatchi
promised
that
a
boat
from
the
prau
would
come
for
me
when
the
sun
is
overhead
we
will
wait
for
that
boat
there
almayer
who
was
steering
nodded
without
speaking
and
by
a
slight
sweep
of
his
paddle
laid
the
head
of
the
canoe
in
the
required
direction
they
were
just
leaving
the
southern
outlet
of
the
pantai
which
lay
behind
them
in
a
straight
and
long
vista
of
water
shining
between
two
walls
of
thick
verdure
that
ran
downwards
and
towards
each
other
till
at
last
they
joined
and
sank
together
in
the
far
-
away
distance
the
sun
rising
above
the
calm
waters
of
the
straits
marked
its
own
path
by
a
streak
of
light
that
glided
upon
the
sea
and
darted
up
the
wide
reach
of
the
river
a
hurried
messenger
of
light
and
life
to
the
gloomy
forests
of
the
coast
and
in
this
radiance
of
the
sun
'
s
pathway
floated
the
black
canoe
heading
for
the
islet
which
lay
bathed
in
sunshine
the
yellow
sands
of
its
encircling
beach
shining
like
an
inlaid
golden
disc
on
the
polished
steel
of
the
unwrinkled
sea
to
the
north
and
south
of
it
rose
other
islets
joyous
in
their
brilliant
colouring
of
green
and
yellow
and
on
the
main
coast
the
sombre
line
of
mangrove
bushes
ended
to
the
southward
in
the
reddish
cliffs
of
tanjong
mirrah
advancing
into
the
sea
steep
and
shadowless
under
the
clear
light
of
the
early
morning
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
grated
upon
the
sand
as
the
little
craft
ran
upon
the
beach
ali
leaped
on
shore
and
held
on
while
dain
stepped
out
carrying
nina
in
his
arms
exhausted
by
the
events
and
the
long
travelling
during
the
night
almayer
was
the
last
to
leave
the
boat
and
together
with
ali
ran
it
higher
up
on
the
beach
then
ali
tired
out
by
the
long
paddling
laid
down
in
the
shade
of
the
canoe
and
incontinently
fell
asleep
almayer
sat
sideways
on
the
gunwale
and
with
his
arms
crossed
on
his
breast
looked
to
the
southward
upon
the
sea
after
carefully
laying
nina
down
in
the
shade
of
the
bushes
growing
in
the
middle
of
the
islet
dain
threw
himself
beside
her
and
watched
in
silent
concern
the
tears
that
ran
down
from
under
her
closed
eyelids
and
lost
themselves
in
that
fine
sand
upon
which
they
both
were
lying
face
to
face
these
tears
and
this
sorrow
were
for
him
a
profound
and
disquieting
mystery
now
when
the
danger
was
past
why
should
she
grieve
he
doubted
her
love
no
more
than
he
would
have
doubted
the
fact
of
his
own
existence
but
as
he
lay
looking
ardently
in
her
face
watching
her
tears
her
parted
lips
her
very
breath
he
was
uneasily
conscious
of
something
in
her
he
could
not
understand
doubtless
she
had
the
wisdom
of
perfect
beings
he
sighed
he
felt
something
invisible
that
stood
between
them
something
that
would
let
him
approach
her
so
far
but
no
farther
no
desire
no
longing
no
effort
of
will
or
length
of
life
could
destroy
this
vague
feeling
of
their
difference
with
awe
but
also
with
great
pride
he
concluded
that
it
was
her
own
incomparable
perfection
she
was
his
and
yet
she
was
like
a
woman
from
another
world
his
his
he
exulted
in
the
glorious
thought
nevertheless
her
tears
pained
him
with
a
wisp
of
her
own
hair
which
he
took
in
his
hand
with
timid
reverence
he
tried
in
an
access
of
clumsy
tenderness
to
dry
the
tears
that
trembled
on
her
eyelashes
he
had
his
reward
in
a
fleeting
smile
that
brightened
her
face
for
the
short
fraction
of
a
second
but
soon
the
tears
fell
faster
than
ever
and
he
could
bear
it
no
more
he
rose
and
walked
towards
almayer
who
still
sat
absorbed
in
his
contemplation
of
the
sea
it
was
a
very
very
long
time
since
he
had
seen
the
sea
that
sea
that
leads
everywhere
brings
everything
and
takes
away
so
much
he
had
almost
forgotten
why
he
was
there
and
dreamily
he
could
see
all
his
past
life
on
the
smooth
and
boundless
surface
that
glittered
before
his
eyes
dain
'
s
hand
laid
on
almayer
'
s
shoulder
recalled
him
with
a
start
from
some
country
very
far
away
indeed
he
turned
round
but
his
eyes
seemed
to
look
rather
at
the
place
where
dain
stood
than
at
the
man
himself
dain
felt
uneasy
under
the
unconscious
gaze
what
said
almayer
she
is
crying
murmured
dain
softly
she
is
crying
why
asked
almayer
indifferently
i
came
to
ask
you
my
ranee
smiles
when
looking
at
the
man
she
loves
it
is
the
white
woman
that
is
crying
now
you
would
know
almayer
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
away
again
towards
the
sea
go
tuan
putih
urged
dain
go
to
her
her
tears
are
more
terrible
to
me
than
the
anger
of
gods
are
they
you
will
see
them
more
than
once
she
told
me
she
could
not
live
without
you
answered
almayer
speaking
without
the
faintest
spark
of
expression
in
his
face
so
it
behoves
you
to
go
to
her
quick
for
fear
you
may
find
her
dead
he
burst
into
a
loud
and
unpleasant
laugh
which
made
dain
stare
at
him
with
some
apprehension
but
got
off
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
and
moved
slowly
towards
nina
glancing
up
at
the
sun
as
he
walked
and
you
go
when
the
sun
is
overhead
he
said
yes
tuan
then
we
go
answered
dain
i
have
not
long
to
wait
muttered
almayer
it
is
most
important
for
me
to
see
you
go
both
of
you
most
important
he
repeated
stopping
short
and
looking
at
dain
fixedly
he
went
on
again
towards
nina
and
dain
remained
behind
almayer
approached
his
daughter
and
stood
for
a
time
looking
down
on
her
she
did
not
open
her
eyes
but
hearing
footsteps
near
her
murmured
in
a
low
sob
dain
almayer
hesitated
for
a
minute
and
then
sank
on
the
sand
by
her
side
she
not
hearing
a
responsive
word
not
feeling
a
touch
opened
her
eyes
saw
her
father
and
sat
up
suddenly
with
a
movement
of
terror
oh
father
she
murmured
faintly
and
in
that
word
there
was
expressed
regret
and
fear
and
dawning
hope
i
shall
never
forgive
you
nina
said
almayer
in
a
dispassionate
voice
you
have
torn
my
heart
from
me
while
i
dreamt
of
your
happiness
you
have
deceived
me
your
eyes
that
for
me
were
like
truth
itself
lied
to
me
in
every
glance
for
how
long
you
know
that
best
when
you
were
caressing
my
cheek
you
were
counting
the
minutes
to
the
sunset
that
was
the
signal
for
your
meeting
with
that
man
there
he
ceased
and
they
both
sat
silent
side
by
side
not
looking
at
each
other
but
gazing
at
the
vast
expanse
of
the
sea
almayer
'
s
words
had
dried
nina
'
s
tears
and
her
look
grew
hard
as
she
stared
before
her
into
the
limitless
sheet
of
blue
that
shone
limpid
unwaving
and
steady
like
heaven
itself
he
looked
at
it
also
but
his
features
had
lost
all
expression
and
life
in
his
eyes
seemed
to
have
gone
out
the
face
was
a
blank
without
a
sign
of

feeling
reason
or
even
knowledge
of
itself
all
passion
regret
grief
hope
or
anger
all
were
gone
erased
by
the
hand
of
fate
as
if
after
this
last
stroke
everything
was
over
and
there
was
no
need
for
any
record
those
few
who
saw
almayer
during
the
short
period
of
his
remaining
days
were
always
impressed
by
the
sight
of
that
face
that
seemed
to
know
nothing
of
what
went
on
within
like
the
blank
wall
of
a
prison
enclosing
sin
regrets
and
pain
and
wasted
life
in
the
cold
indifference
of
mortar
and
stones
what
is
there
to
forgive
asked
nina
not
addressing
almayer
directly
but
more
as
if
arguing
with
herself
can
i
not
live
my
own
life
as
you
have
lived
yours
the
path
you
would
have
wished
me
to
follow
has
been
closed
to
me
by
no
fault
of
mine
you
never
told
me
muttered
almayer
you
never
asked
me
she
answered
and
i
thought
you
were
like
the
others
and
did
not
care
i
bore
the
memory
of
my
humiliation
alone
and
why
should
i
tell
you
that
it
came
to
me
because
i
am
your
daughter
i
knew
you
could
not
avenge
me
and
yet
i
was
thinking
of
that
only
interrupted
almayer
and
i
wanted
to
give
you
years
of
happiness
for
the
short
day
of
your
suffering
i
only
knew
of
one
way
ah
but
it
was
not
my
way
she
replied
could
you
give
me
happiness
without
life
life
she
repeated
with
sudden
energy
that
sent
the
word
ringing
over
the
sea
life
that
means
power
and
love
she
added
in
a
low
voice
that
said
almayer
pointing
his
finger
at
dain
standing
close
by
and
looking
at
them
in
curious
wonder
yes
that
she
replied
looking
her
father
full
in
the
face
and
noticing
for
the
first
time
with
a
slight
gasp
of
fear
the
unnatural
rigidity
of
his
features
i
would
have
rather
strangled
you
with
my
own
hands
said
almayer
in
an
expressionless
voice
which
was
such
a
contrast
to
the
desperate
bitterness
of
his
feelings
that
it
surprised
even
himself
he
asked
himself
who
spoke
and
after
looking
slowly
round
as
if
expecting
to
see
somebody
turned
again
his
eyes
towards
the
sea
you
say
that
because
you
do
not
understand
the
meaning
of
my
words
she
said
sadly
between
you
and
my
mother
there
never
was
any
love
when
i
returned
to
sambir
i
found
the
place
which
i
thought
would
be
a
peaceful
refuge
for
my
heart
filled
with
weariness
and
hatred
and
mutual
contempt
i
have
listened
to
your
voice
and
to
her
voice
then
i
saw
that
you
could
not
understand
me
for
was
i
not
part
of
that
woman
of
her
who
was
the
regret
and
shame
of
your
life
i
had
to
choose
i
hesitated
why
were
you
so
blind
did
you
not
see
me
struggling
before
your
eyes
but
when
he
came
all
doubt
disappeared
and
i
saw
only
the
light
of
the
blue
and
cloudless
heaven
i
will
tell
you
the
rest
interrupted
almayer
when
that
man
came
i
also
saw
the
blue
and
the
sunshine
of
the
sky
a
thunderbolt
has
fallen
from
that
sky
and
suddenly
all
is
still
and
dark
around
me
for
ever
i
will
never
forgive
you
nina
and
to
-
morrow
i
shall
forget
you
i
shall
never
forgive
you
he
repeated
with
mechanical
obstinacy
while
she
sat
her
head
bowed
down
as
if
afraid
to
look
at
her
father
to
him
it
seemed
of
the
utmost
importance
that
he
should
assure
her
of
his
intention
of
never
forgiving
he
was
convinced
that
his
faith
in
her
had
been
the
foundation
of
his
hopes
the
motive
of
his
courage
of
his
determination
to
live
and
struggle
and
to
be
victorious
for
her
sake
and
now
his
faith
was
gone
destroyed
by
her
own
hands
destroyed
cruelly
treacherously
in
the
dark
in
the
very
moment
of
success
in
the
utter
wreck
of
his
affections
and
of
all
his
feelings
in
the
chaotic
disorder
of
his
thoughts
above
the
confused
sensation
of
physical
pain
that
wrapped
him
up
in
a
sting
as
of
a
whiplash
curling
round
him
from
his
shoulders
down
to
his
feet
only
one
idea
remained
clear
and
definite
not
to
forgive
her
only
one
vivid
desire
to
forget
her
and
this
must
be
made
clear
to
her
and
to
himself
by
frequent
repetition
that
was
his
idea
of
his
duty
to
himself
to
his
race
to
his
respectable
connections
to
the
whole
universe
unsettled
and
shaken
by
this
frightful
catastrophe
of
his
life
he
saw
it
clearly
and
believed
he
was
a
strong
man
he
had
always
prided
himself
upon
his
unflinching
firmness
and
yet
he
was
afraid
she
had
been
all
in
all
to
him
what
if
he
should
let
the
memory
of
his
love
for
her
weaken
the
sense
of
his
dignity
she
was
a
remarkable
woman
he
could
see
that
all
the
latent
greatness
of
his
nature
in
which
he
honestly
believed
had
been
transfused
into
that
slight
girlish
figure
great
things
could
be
done
what
if
he
should
suddenly
take
her
to
his
heart
forget
his
shame
and
pain
and
anger
and
follow
her
what
if
he
changed
his
heart
if
not
his
skin
and
made
her
life
easier
between
the
two
loves
that
would
guard
her
from
any
mischance
his
heart
yearned
for
her
what
if
he
should
say
that
his
love
for
her
was
greater
than
i
will
never
forgive
you
nina
he
shouted
leaping
up
madly
in
the
sudden
fear
of
his
dream
this
was
the
last
time
in
his
life
that
he
was
heard
to
raise
his
voice
henceforth
he
spoke
always
in
a
monotonous
whisper
like
an
instrument
of
which
all
the
strings
but
one
are
broken
in
a
last
ringing
clamour
under
a
heavy
blow
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
looked
at
him
the
very
violence
of
his
cry
soothed
her
in
an
intuitive
conviction
of
his
love
and
she
hugged
to
her
breast
the
lamentable
remnants
of
that
affection
with
the
unscrupulous
greediness
of
women
who
cling
desperately
to
the
very
scraps
and
rags
of
love
any
kind
of
love
as
a
thing
that
of
right
belongs
to
them
and
is
the
very
breath
of
their
life
she
put
both
her
hands
on
almayer
'
s
shoulders
and
looking
at
him
half
tenderly
half
playfully
she
said
you
speak
so
because
you
love
me
almayer
shook
his
head
yes
you
do
she
insisted
softly
then
after
a
short
pause
she
added
and
you
will
never
forget
me
almayer
shivered
slightly
she
could
not
have
said
a
more
cruel
thing
here
is
the
boat
coming
now
said
dain
his
arm
outstretched
towards
a
black
speck
on
the
water
between
the
coast
and
the
islet
they
all
looked
at
it
and
remained
standing
in
silence
till
the
little
canoe
came
gently
on
the
beach
and
a
man
landed
and
walked
towards
them
he
stopped
some
distance
off
and
hesitated
what
news
asked
dain
we
have
had
orders
secretly
and
in
the
night
to
take
off
from
this
islet
a
man
and
a
woman
i
see
the
woman
which
of
you
is
the
man
come
delight
of
my
eyes
said
dain
to
nina
now
we
go
and
your
voice
shall
be
for
my
ears
only
you
have
spoken
your
last
words
to
the
tuan
putih
your
father
come
she
hesitated
for
a
while
looking
at
almayer
who
kept
his
eyes
steadily
on
the
sea
then
she
touched
his
forehead
in
a
lingering
kiss
and
a
tear
one
of
her
tears
fell
on
his
cheek
and
ran
down
his
immovable
face
goodbye
she
whispered
and
remained
irresolute
till
he
pushed
her
suddenly
into
dain
'
s
arms
if
you
have
any
pity
for
me
murmured
almayer
as
if
repeating
some
sentence
learned
by
heart
take
that
woman
away
he
stood
very
straight
his
shoulders
thrown
back
his
head
held
high
and
looked
at
them
as
they
went
down
the
beach
to
the
canoe
walking
enlaced
in
each
other
'
s
arms
he
looked
at
the
line
of
their
footsteps
marked
in
the
sand
he
followed
their
figures
moving
in
the
crude
blaze
of
the
vertical
sun
in
that
light
violent
and
vibrating
like
a
triumphal
flourish
of
brazen
trumpets
he
looked
at
the
man
'
s
brown
shoulders
at
the
red
sarong
round
his
waist
at
the
tall
slender
dazzling
white
figure
he
supported
he
looked
at
the
white
dress
at
the
falling
masses
of
the
long
black
hair
he
looked
at
them
embarking
and
at
the
canoe
growing
smaller
in
the
distance
with
rage
despair
and
regret
in
his
heart
and
on
his
face
a
peace
as
that
of
a
carved
image
of
oblivion
inwardly
he
felt
himself
torn
to
pieces
but
ali
who
now
aroused
stood
close
to
his
master
saw
on
his
features
the
blank
expression
of
those
who
live
in
that
hopeless
calm
which
sightless
eyes
only
can
give
the
canoe
disappeared
and
almayer
stood
motionless
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
its
wake
ali
from
under
the
shade
of
his
hand
examined
the
coast
curiously
as
the
sun
declined
the
sea
-
breeze
sprang
up
from
the
northward
and
shivered
with
its
breath
the
glassy
surface
of
the
water
dapat
exclaimed
ali
joyously
got

almayer
followed
ali
'
s
forefinger
with
his
eyes
for
a
long
time
in
vain
at
last
he
sighted
a
triangular
patch
of
yellow
light
on
the
red
background
of
the
cliffs
of
tanjong
mirrah
it
was
the
sail
of
the
prau
that
had
caught
the
sunlight
and
stood
out
distinct
with
its
gay
tint
on
the
dark
red
of
the
cape
the
yellow
triangle
crept
slowly
from
cliff
to
cliff
till
it
cleared
the
last
point
of
land
and
shone
brilliantly
for
a
fleeting
minute
on
the
blue
of
the
open
sea
then
the
prau
bore
up
to
the
southward
the
light
went
out
of
the
sail
and
all
at
once
the
vessel
itself
disappeared
vanishing
in
the
shadow
of
the
steep
headland
that
looked
on
patient
and
lonely
watching
over
the
empty
sea
almayer
never
moved
round
the
little
islet
the
air
was
full
of
the
talk
of
the
rippling
water
the
crested
wavelets
ran
up
the
beach
audaciously
joyously
with
the
lightness
of
young
life
and
died
quickly
unresistingly
and
graciously
in
the
wide
curves
of
transparent
foam
on
the
yellow
sand
above
the
white
clouds
sailed
rapidly
southwards
as
if
intent
upon
overtaking
something
ali
seemed
anxious
master
he
said
timidly
time
to
get
house
now
long
way
off
to
pull
all
ready
sir
wait
whispered
almayer
now
she
was
gone
his
business
was
to
forget
and
he
had
a
strange
notion
that
it
should
be
done
systematically
and
in
order
to
ali
'
s
great
dismay
he
fell
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
creeping
along
the
sand
erased
carefully
with
his
hand
all
traces
of
nina
'
s
footsteps
he
piled
up
small
heaps
of
sand
leaving
behind
him
a
line
of
miniature
graves
right
down
to
the
water
after
burying
the
last
slight
imprint
of
nina
'
s
slipper
he
stood
up
and
turning
his
face
towards
the
headland
where
he
had
last
seen
the
prau
he
made
an
effort
to
shout
out
loud
again
his
firm
resolve
to
never
forgive
ali
watching
him
uneasily
saw
only
his
lips
move
but
heard
no
sound
he
brought
his
foot
down
with
a
stamp
he
was
a
firm
man
firm
as
a
rock
let
her
go
he
never
had
a
daughter
he
would
forget
he
was
forgetting
already
ali
approached
him
again
insisting
on
immediate
departure
and
this
time
he
consented
and
they
went
together
towards
their
canoe
almayer
leading
for
all
his
firmness
he
looked
very
dejected
and
feeble
as
he
dragged
his
feet
slowly
through
the
sand
on
the
beach
and
by
his
side
invisible
to
ali
stalked
that
particular
fiend
whose
mission
it
is
to
jog
the
