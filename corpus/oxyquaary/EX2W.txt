the
25th
day
of
august
,
1751
,
about
two
in
the
afternoon
,
i
,
david
balfour
,
came
forth
of
the
british
linen
company
,
a
porter
attending
me
with
a
bag
of
money
,
and
some
of
the
chief
of
these
merchants
bowing
me
from
their
doors
.
two
days
before
,
and
even
so
late
as
yestermorning
,
i
was
like
a
beggar
-
man
by
the
wayside
,
clad
in
rags
,
brought
down
to
my
last
shillings
,
my
companion
a
condemned
traitor
,
a
price
set
on
my
own
head
for
a
crime
with
the
news
of
which
the
country
rang
.
to
-
day
i
was
served
heir
to
my
position
in
life
,
a
landed
laird
,
a
bank
porter
by
me
carrying
my
gold
,
recommendations
in
my
pocket
,
and
(
in
the
words
of
the
saying
)
the
ball
directly
at
my
foot
.
there
were
two
circumstances
that
served
me
as
ballast
to
so
much
sail
.
the
first
was
the
very
difficult
and
deadly
business
i
had
still
to
handle
;
the
second
,
the
place
that
i
was
in
.
the
tall
,
black
city
,
and
the
numbers
and
movement
and
noise
of
so
many
folk
,
made
a
new
world
for
me
,
after
the
moorland
braes
,
the
sea
-
sands
and
the
still
country
-
sides
that
i
had
frequented
up
to
then
.
the
throng
of
the
citizens
in
particular
abashed
me
.
rankeillor
'
s
son
was
short
and
small
in
the
girth
;
his
clothes
scarce
held
on
me
;
and
it
was
plain
i
was
ill
qualified
to
strut
in
the
front
of
a
bank
-
porter
.
it
was
plain
,
if
i
did
so
,
i
should
but
set
folk
laughing
,
and
(
what
was
worse
in
my
case
)
set
them
asking
questions
.
so
that
i
behooved
to
come
by
some
clothes
of
my
own
,
and
in
the
meanwhile
to
walk
by
the
porter
'
s
side
,
and
put
my
hand
on
his
arm
as
though
we
were
a
pair
of
friends
.
at
a
merchant
'
s
in
the
luckenbooths
i
had
myself
fitted
out
:
none
too
fine
,
for
i
had
no
idea
to
appear
like
a
beggar
on
horseback
;
but
comely
and
responsible
,
so
that
servants
should
respect
me
.
thence
to
an
armourer
'
s
,
where
i
got
a
plain
sword
,
to
suit
with
my
degree
in
life
.
i
felt
safer
with
the
weapon
,
though
(
for
one
so
ignorant
of
defence
)
it
might
be
called
an
added
danger
.
the
porter
,
who
was
naturally
a
man
of
some
experience
,
judged
my
accoutrement
to
be
well
chosen
.
"
naething
kenspeckle
,
"
said
he
;
"
plain
,
dacent
claes
.
as
for
the
rapier
,
nae
doubt
it
sits
wi
'
your
degree
;
but
an
i
had
been
you
,
i
would
has
waired
my
siller
better
-
gates
than
that
.
"
and
he
proposed
i
should
buy
winter
-
hosen
from
a
wife
in
the
cowgate
-
back
,
that
was
a
cousin
of
his
own
,
and
made
them
"
extraordinar
endurable
.
"
but
i
had
other
matters
on
my
hand
more
pressing
.
here
i
was
in
this
old
,
black
city
,
which
was
for
all
the
world
like
a
rabbit
-
warren
,
not
only
by
the
number
of
its
indwellers
,
but
the
complication
of
its
passages
and
holes
.
it
was
,
indeed
,
a
place
where
no
stranger
had
a
chance
to
find
a
friend
,
let
be
another
stranger
.
suppose
him
even
to
hit
on
the
right
close
,
people
dwelt
so
thronged
in
these
tall
houses
,
he
might
very
well
seek
a
day
before
he
chanced
on
the
right
door
.
the
ordinary
course
was
to
hire
a
lad
they
called
a
caddie
,
who
was
like
a
guide
or
pilot
,
led
you
where
you
had
occasion
,
and
(
your
errands
being
done
)
brought
you
again
where
you
were
lodging
.
but
these
caddies
,
being
always
employed
in
the
same
sort
of
services
,
and
having
it
for
obligation
to
be
well
informed
of
every
house
and
person
in
the
city
,
had
grown
to
form
a
brotherhood
of
spies
;
and
i
knew
from
tales
of
mr
campbell
'
s
how
they
communicated
one
with
another
,
what
a
rage
of
curiosity
they
conceived
as
to
their
employer
'
s
business
,
and
how
they
were
like
eyes
and
fingers
to
the
police
.
it
would
be
a
piece
of
little
wisdom
,
the
way
i
was
now
placed
,
to
take
such
a
ferret
to
my
tails
.
i
had
three
visits
to
make
,
all
immediately
needful
:
to
my
kinsman
mr
balfour
of
pilrig
,
to
stewart
the
writer
that
was
appin
'
s
agent
,
and
to
william
grant
esquire
of
prestongrange
,
lord
advocate
of
scotland
.
mr
balfour
'
s
was
a
non
-
committal
visit
;
and
besides
(
pilrig
being
in
the
country
)
i
made
bold
to
find
the
way
to
it
myself
,
with
the
help
of
my
two
legs
and
a
scots
tongue
.
but
the
rest
were
in
a
different
case
.
not
only
was
the
visit
to
appin
'
s
agent
,
in
the
midst
of
the
cry
about
the
appin
murder
,
dangerous
in
itself
,
but
it
was
highly
inconsistent
with
the
other
.
i
was
like
to
have
a
bad
enough
time
of
it
with
my
lord
advocate
grant
,
the
best
of
ways
;
but
to
go
to
him
hot
-
foot
from
appin
'
s
agent
,
was
little
likely
to
mend
my
own
affairs
,
and
might
prove
the
mere
ruin
of
friend
alan
'
s
.
the
whole
thing
,
besides
,
gave
me
a
look
of
running
with
the
hare
and
hunting
with
the
hounds
that
was
little
to
my
fancy
.
i
determined
,
therefore
,
to
be
done
at
once
with
mr
stewart
and
the
whole
jacobitical
side
of
my
business
,
and
to
profit
for
that
purpose
by
the
guidance
of
the
porter
at
my
side
.
but
it
chanced
i
had
scarce
given
him
the
address
,
when
there
came
a
sprinkle
of
rain
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
nothing
to
hurt
,
only
for
my
new
clothes
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
we
took
shelter
under
a
pend
at
the
head
of
a
close
or
alley
.
being
strange
to
what
i
saw
,
i
stepped
a
little
farther
in
.
the
narrow
paved
way
descended
swiftly
.
prodigious
tall
houses
sprang
upon
each
side
and
bulged
out
,
one
storey
beyond
another
,
as
they
rose
.
at
the
top
only
a
ribbon
of
sky
showed
in
.
by
what
i
could
spy
in
the
windows
,
and
by
the
respectable
persons
that
passed
out
and
in
,
i
saw
the
houses
to
be
very
well
occupied
;
and
the
whole
appearance
of
the
place
interested
me
like
a
tale
.
i
was
still
gazing
,
when
there
came
a
sudden
brisk
tramp
of
feet
in
time
and
clash
of
steel
behind
me
.
turning
quickly
,
i
was
aware
of
a
party
of
armed
soldiers
,
and
,
in
their
midst
,
a
tall
man
in
a
great
coat
.
he
walked
with
a
stoop
that
was
like
a
piece
of
courtesy
,
genteel
and
insinuating
:
he
waved
his
hands
plausibly
as
he
went
,
and
his
face
was
sly
and
handsome
.
i
thought
his
eye
took
me
in
,
but
could
not
meet
it
.
this
procession
went
by
to
a
door
in
the
close
,
which
a
serving
-
man
in
a
fine
livery
set
open
;
and
two
of
the
soldier
-
lads
carried
the
prisoner
within
,
the
rest
lingering
with
their
firelocks
by
the
door
.
there
can
nothing
pass
in
the
streets
of
a
city
without
some
following
of
idle
folk
and
children
.
it
was
so
now
;
but
the
more
part
melted
away
incontinent
until
but
three
were
left
.
one
was
a
girl
;
she
was
dressed
like
a
lady
,
and
had
a
screen
of
the
drummond
colours
on
her
head
;
but
her
comrades
or
(
i
should
say
)
followers
were
ragged
gillies
,
such
as
i
had
seen
the
matches
of
by
the
dozen
in
my
highland
journey
.
they
all
spoke
together
earnestly
in
gaelic
,
the
sound
of
which
was
pleasant
in
my
ears
for
the
sake
of
alan
;
and
,
though
the
rain
was
by
again
,
and
my
porter
plucked
at
me
to
be
going
,
i
even
drew
nearer
where
they
were
,
to
listen
.
the
lady
scolded
sharply
,
the
others
making
apologies
and
cringeing
before
her
,
so
that
i
made
sure
she
was
come
of
a
chief
'
s
house
.
all
the
while
the
three
of
them
sought
in
their
pockets
,
and
by
what
i
could
make
out
,
they
had
the
matter
of
half
a
farthing
among
the
party
;
which
made
me
smile
a
little
to
see
all
highland
folk
alike
for
fine
obeisances
and
empty
sporrans
.
it
chanced
the
girl
turned
suddenly
about
,
so
that
i
saw
her
face
for
the
first
time
.
there
is
no
greater
wonder
than
the
way
the
face
of
a
young
woman
fits
in
a
man
'
s
mind
,
and
stays
there
,
and
he
could
never
tell
you
why
;
it
just
seems
it
was
the
thing
he
wanted
.
she
had
wonderful
bright
eyes
like
stars
,
and
i
daresay
the
eyes
had
a
part
in
it
;
but
what
i
remember
the
most
clearly
was
the
way
her
lips
were
a
trifle
open
as
she
turned
.
and
,
whatever
was
the
cause
,
i
stood
there
staring
like
a
fool
.
on
her
side
,
as
she
had
not
known
there
was
anyone
so
near
,
she
looked
at
me
a
little
longer
,
and
perhaps
with
more
surprise
,
than
was
entirely
civil
.
it
went
through
my
country
head
she
might
be
wondering
at
my
new
clothes
;
with
that
,
i
blushed
to
my
hair
,
and
at
the
sight
of
my
colouring
it
is
to
be
supposed
she
drew
her
own
conclusions
,
for
she
moved
her
gillies
farther
down
the
close
,
and
they
fell
again
to
this
dispute
,
where
i
could
hear
no
more
of
it
.
i
had
often
admired
a
lassie
before
then
,
if
scarce
so
sudden
and
strong
;
and
it
was
rather
my
disposition
to
withdraw
than
to
come
forward
,
for
i
was
much
in
fear
of
mockery
from
the
womenkind
.
you
would
have
thought
i
had
now
all
the
more
reason
to
pursue
my
common
practice
,
since
i
had
met
this
young
lady
in
the
city
street
,
seemingly
following
a
prisoner
,
and
accompanied
with
two
very
ragged
indecent
-
like
highlandmen
.
but
there
was
here
a
different
ingredient
;
it
was
plain
the
girl
thought
i
had
been
prying
in
her
secrets
;
and
with
my
new
clothes
and
sword
,
and
at
the
top
of
my
new
fortunes
,
this
was
more
than
i
could
swallow
.
the
beggar
on
horseback
could
not
bear
to
be
thrust
down
so
low
,
or
,
at
least
of
it
,
not
by
this
young
lady
.
i
followed
,
accordingly
,
and
took
off
my
new
hat
to
her
the
best
that
i
was
able
.
"
madam
,
"
said
i
,
"
i
think
it
only
fair
to
myself
to
let
you
understand
i
have
no
gaelic
.
it
is
true
i
was
listening
,
for
i
have
friends
of
my
own
across
the
highland
line
,
and
the
sound
of
that
tongue
comes
friendly
;
but
for
your
private
affairs
,
if
you
had
spoken
greek
,
i
might
have
had
more
guess
at
them
.
"
she
made
me
a
little
,
distant
curtsey
.
"
there
is
no
harm
done
,
"
said
she
,
with
a
pretty
accent
,
most
like
the
english
(
but
more
agreeable
)

i

certain
pieces

scarcely
fit

before

more
remains

"
says
the
writer
.
the
next
morning

i
was
no
sooner
awake
in
my
new
lodging
than
i
was
up
and
into
my
new
clothes
;
and
no
sooner
the
breakfast
swallowed
,
than
i
was
forth
on
my
adventurers
.
alan
,
i
could
hope
,
was
fended
for
;
james
was
like
to
be
a
more
difficult
affair
,
and
i
could
not
but
think
that
enterprise
might
cost
me
dear
,
even
as
everybody
said
to
whom
i
had
opened
my
opinion
.
it
seemed
i
was
come
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
only
to
cast
myself
down
;
that
i
had
clambered
up
,
through
so
many
and
hard
trials
,
to
be
rich
,
to
be
recognised
,
to
wear
city
clothes
and
a
sword
to
my
side
,
all
to
commit
mere
suicide
at
the
last
end
of
it
,
and
the
worst
kind
of
suicide
,
besides
,
which
is
to
get
hanged
at
the
king
'
s
charges
.
what
was
i
doing
it
for
?
i
asked
,
as
i
went
down
the
high
street
and
out
north
by
leith
wynd
.
first
i
said
it
was
to
save
james
stewart
;
and
no
doubt
the
memory
of
his
distress
,
and
his
wife
'
s
cries
,
and
a
word
or
so
i
had
let
drop
on
that
occasion
worked
upon
me
strongly
.
at
the
same
time
i
reflected
that
it
was
(
or
ought
to
be
)
the
most
indifferent
matter
to
my
father
'
s
son
,
whether
james
died
in
his
bed
or
from
a
scaffold
.
he
was
alan
'
s
cousin
,
to
be
sure
;
but
so
far
as
regarded
alan
,
the
best
thing
would
be
to
lie
low
,
and
let
the
king
,
and
his
grace
of
argyll
,
and
the
corbie
crows
,
pick
the
bones
of
his
kinsman
their
own
way
.
nor
could
i
forget
that
,
while
we
were
all
in
the
pot
together
,
james
had
shown
no
such
particular
anxiety
whether
for
alan
or
me
.
next
it
came
upon
me
i
was
acting
for
the
sake
of
justice
:
and
i
thought
that
a
fine
word
,
and
reasoned
it
out
that
(
since
we
dwelt
in
polities
,
at
some
discomfort
to
each
one
of
us
)
the
main
thing
of
all
must
still
be
justice
,
and
the
death
of
any
innocent
man
a
wound
upon
the
whole
community
.
next
,
again
,
it
was
the
accuser
of
the
brethren
that
gave
me
a
turn
of
his
argument
;
bade
me
think
shame
for
pretending
myself
concerned
in
these
high
matters
,
and
told
me
i
was
but
a
prating
vain
child
,
who
had
spoken
big
words
to
rankeillor
and
to
stewart
,
and
held
myself
bound
upon
my
vanity
to
make
good
that
boastfulness
.
nay
,
and
he
hit
me
with
the
other
end
of
the
stick
;
for
he
accused
me
of
a
kind
of
artful
cowardice
,
going
about
at
the
expense
of
a
little
risk
to
purchase
greater
safety
.
no
doubt
,
until
i
had
declared
and
cleared
myself
,
i
might
any
day
encounter
mungo
campbell
or
the
sheriff
'
s
officer
,
and
be
recognised
,
and
dragged
into
the
appin
murder
by
the
heels
;
and
,
no
doubt
,
in
case
i
could
manage
my
declaration
with
success
,
i
should
breathe
more
free
for
ever
after
.
but
when
i
looked
this
argument
full
in
the
face
i
could
see
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
.
as
for
the
rest
,
"
here
are
the
two
roads
,
"
i
thought
,
"
and
both
go
to
the
same
place
.
it
is
unjust
that
james
should
hang
if
i
can
save
him
;
and
it
would
be
ridiculous
in
me
to
have
talked
so
much
and
then
do
nothing
.
it
is
lucky
for
james
of
the
glens
that
i
have
boasted
beforehand
;
and
none
so
unlucky
for
myself
,
because
now
i
am
committed
to
do
right
.
i
have
the
name
of
a
gentleman
and
the
means
of
one
;
it
would
be
a
poor
duty
that
i
was
wanting
in
the
essence
.
"
and
then
i
thought
this
was
a
pagan
spirit
,
and
said
a
prayer
in
to
myself
,
asking
for
what
courage
i
might
lack
,
and
that
i
might
go
straight
to
my
duty
like
a
soldier
to
battle
,
and
come
off
again
scatheless
,
as
so
many
do
.
this
train
of
reasoning
brought
me
to
a
more
resolved
complexion
;
though
it
was
far
from
closing
up
my
sense
of
the
dangers
that
surrounded
me
,
nor
of
how
very
apt
i
was
(
if
i
went
on
)
to
stumble
on
the
ladder
of
the
gallows
.
it
was
a
plain
,
fair
morning
,
but
the
wind
in
the
east
.
the
little
chill
of
it
sang
in
my
blood
,
and
gave
me
a
feeling
of
the
autumn
,
and
the
dead
leaves
,
and
dead
folks
'
bodies
in
their
graves
.
it
seemed
the
devil
was
in
it
,
if
i
was
to
die
in
that
tide
of
my
fortunes
and
for
other
folks
'
affairs
.
on
the
top
of
the
calton
hill
,
though
it
was
not
the
customary
time
of
year
for
that
diversion
,
some
children
were
crying
and
running
with
their
kites
.
these
toys
appeared
very
plain
against
the
sky
;
i
remarked
a
great
one
soar
on
the
wind
to
a
high
altitude
and
then
plump
among
the
whins
;
and
i
thought
to
myself
at
sight
of
it
,
"
there
goes
davie
.
"
my
way
lay
over
mouter
'
s
hill
,
and
through
an
end
of
a
clachan
on
the
braeside
among
fields
.
there
was
a
whirr
of
looms
in
it
went
from
house
to
house
;
bees
bummed
in
the
gardens
;
the
neighbours
that
i
saw
at
the
doorsteps
talked
in
a
strange
tongue
;
and
i
found
out
later
that
this
was
picardy
,
a
village
where
the
french
weavers
wrought
for
the
linen
company
.
here
i
got
a
fresh
direction
for
pilrig
,
my
destination
;
and
a
little
beyond
,
on
the
wayside
,
came
by
a
gibbet
and
two
men
hanged
in
chains
.
they
were
dipped
in
tar
,
as
the
manner
is
;
the
wind
span
them
,
the
chains
clattered
,
and
the
birds
hung
about
the
uncanny
jumping
-
jacks
and
cried
.
the
sight
coming
on
me
suddenly
,
like
an
illustration
of
my
fears
,
i
could
scarce
be
done
with
examining
it
and
drinking
in
discomfort
.
and
,
as
i
thus
turned
and
turned
about
the
gibbet
,
what
should
i
strike
on
,
but
a
weird
old
wife
,
that
sat
behind
a
leg
of
it
,
and
nodded
,
and
talked
aloud
to
herself
with
becks
and
courtesies
.
"
who
are
these
two
,
mother
?
"
i
asked
,
and
pointed
to
the
corpses
.
"

cried

the
two
chance
shots
that
seemed
to
point
at
alan
and
the
daughter
of
james
more
struck
me
hard
;
and
i
fled
from
the
eldritch
creature
,
casting
her
a
baubee
,
which
she
continued
to
sit
and
play
with
under
the
moving
shadows
of
the
hanged
.
my
way
down
the
causeway
of
leith
walk
would
have
been
more
pleasant
to
me
but
for
this
encounter
.
the
old
rampart
ran
among
fields
,
the
like
of
them
i
had
never
seen
for
artfulness
of
agriculture
;
i
was
pleased
,
besides
,
to
be
so
far
in
the
still
countryside
;
but
the
shackles
of
the
gibbet
clattered
in
my
head
;
and
the
mope
and
mows
of
the
old
witch
,
and
the
thought
of
the
dead
men
,
hag
-
rode
my
spirits
.
to
hang
on
a
gallows
,
that
seemed
a
hard
case
;
and
whether
a
man
came
to
hang
there
for
two
shillings
scots
,
or
(
as
mr
stewart
had
it
)
from
the
sense
of
duty
,
once
he
was
tarred
and
shackled
and
hung
up
,
the
difference
seemed
small
.
there
might
david
balfour
hang
,
and
other
lads
pass
on
their
errands
and
think
light
of
him
;
and
old
daft
limmers
sit
at
a
leg
-
foot
and
spae
their
fortunes
;
and
the
clean
genty
maids
go
by
,
and
look
to
the
other
aide
,
and
hold
a
nose
.
i
saw
them
plain
,
and
they
had
grey
eyes
,
and
their
screens
upon
their
heads
were
of
the
drummed
colours
.
i
was
thus
in
the
poorest
of
spirits
,
though
still
pretty
resolved
,
when
i
came
in
view
of
pilrig
,
a
pleasant
gabled
house
set
by
the
walkside
among
some
brave
young
woods
.
the
laird
'
s
horse
was
standing
saddled
at
the
door
as
i
came
up
,
but
himself
was
in
the
study
,
where
he
received
me
in
the
midst
of
learned
works
and
musical
instruments
,
for
he
was
not
only
a
deep
philosopher
but
much
of
a
musician
.
he
greeted
me
at
first
pretty
well
,
and
when
he
had
read
rankeillor
'
s
letter
,
placed
himself
obligingly
at
my
disposal
.
"

can
do

word

"

i

you

out

i

the
man

would
think
the
better

me

enjoyed
,

the
more
valuable

i
am
not
in

i
understand
him

have
a
matter

his
majesty

the
administration

your

known

some

"
my
kinsman
kept
me
to
a
meal
,
"
for
the
honour
of
the
roof
,
"
he
said
;
and
i
believe
i
made
the
better
speed
on
my
return
.
i
had
no
thought
but
to
be
done
with
the
next
stage
,
and
have
myself
fully
committed
;
to
a
person
circumstanced
as
i
was
,
the
appearance
of
closing
a
door
on
hesitation
and
temptation
was
itself
extremely
tempting
;
and
i
was
the
more
disappointed
,
when
i
came
to
prestongrange
'
s
house
,
to
be
informed
he
was
abroad
.
i
believe
it
was
true
at
the
moment
,
and
for
some
hours
after
;
and
then
i
have
no
doubt
the
advocate
came
home
again
,
and
enjoyed
himself
in
a
neighbouring
chamber
among
friends
,
while
perhaps
the
very
fact
of
my
arrival
was
forgotten
.
i
would
have
gone
away
a
dozen
times
,
only
for
this
strong
drawing
to
have
done
with
my
declaration
out
of
hand
and
be
able
to
lay
me
down
to
sleep
with
a
free
conscience
.
at
first
i
read
,
for
the
little
cabinet
where
i
was
left
contained
a
variety
of
books
.
but
i
fear
i
read
with
little
profit
;
and
the
weather
falling
cloudy
,
the
dusk
coming
up
earlier
than
usual
,
and
my
cabinet
being
lighted
with
but
a
loophole
of
a
window
,
i
was
at
last
obliged
to
desist
from
this
diversion
(
such
as
it
was
)
,
and
pass
the
rest
of
my
time
of
waiting
in
a
very
burthensome
vacuity
.
the
sound
of
people
talking
in
a
near
chamber
,
the
pleasant
note
of
a
harpsichord
,
and
once
the
voice
of
a
lady
singing
,
bore
me
a
kind
of
company
.
i
do
not
know
the
hour
,
but
the
darkness
was
long
come
,
when
the
door
of
the
cabinet
opened
,
and
i
was
aware
,
by
the
light
behind
him
,
of
a
tall
figure
of
a
man
upon
the
threshold
.
i
rose
at
once
.
"
is
anybody
there
?
"
he
asked
.
"
who
in
that
?
"
"
i
am
bearer
of
a
letter
from
the
laird
of
pilrig
to
the
lord
advocate
,
"
said
i
.
"
have
you
been
here
long
?
"
he
asked
.
"
i
would
not
like
to
hazard
an
estimate
of
how
many
hours
,
"
said
i
.
"
it
is
the
first
i
hear
of
it
,
"
he
replied
,
with
a
chuckle
.
"
the
lads
must
have
forgotten
you
.

you
are
in
the
bit
at
last

i
am

"
so
saying
,
he
passed
before
me
into
the
next
room
,
whither
(
upon
his
sign
)
i
followed
him
,
and
where
he
lit
a
candle
and
took
his
place
before
a
business
-
table
.
it
was
a
long
room
,
of
a
good
proportion
,
wholly
lined
with
books
.
that
small
spark
of
light
in
a
corner
struck
out
the
man
'
s
handsome
person
and
strong
face
.
he
was
flushed
,
his
eye
watered
and
sparkled
,
and
before
he
sat
down
i
observed
him
to
sway
back
and
forth
.
no
doubt
,
he
had
been
supping
liberally
;
but
his
mind
and
tongue
were
under
full
control
.
"
well
,
sir
,
sit
ye
down
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
let
us
see

'
s
letter

"
he
glanced
it
through
in
the
beginning
carelessly
,
looking
up
and
bowing
when
he
came
to
my
name
;
but
at
the
last
words
i
thought
i
observed
his
attention
to
redouble
,
and
i
made
sure
he
read
them
twice
.
all
this
while
you
are
to
suppose
my
heart
was
beating
,
for
i
had
now
crossed
my
rubicon
and
was
come
fairly
on
the
field
of
battle
.
"

pleased

make
your

said

have
mentioned

some
gravity

i
am
little
used
with
wine

i
might
be

bell

a
footman
came

at
a
signal

bringing
wine

glasses
.
"

way

far

he
inquired

thrust
away
his
glass
once

sat
straight
up
in

chair

he
had
been
previously
lolling
