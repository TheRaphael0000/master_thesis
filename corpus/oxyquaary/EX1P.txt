harold
march
the
rising
reviewer
and
social
critic
was
walking
vigorously
across
a
great
tableland
of
moors
and
commons
the
horizon
of
which
was
fringed
with
the
far
-
off
woods
of
the
famous
estate
of
torwood
park
he
was
a
good
-
looking
young
man
in
tweeds
with
very
pale
curly
hair
and
pale
clear
eyes
walking
in
wind
and
sun
in
the
very
landscape
of
liberty
he
was
still
young
enough
to
remember
his
politics
and
not
merely
try
to
forget
them
for
his
errand
at
torwood
park
was
a
political
one
it
was
the
place
of
appointment
named
by
no
less
a
person
than
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
sir
howard
horne
then
introducing
his
so
-
called
socialist
budget
and
prepared
to
expound
it
in
an
interview
with
so
promising
a
penman
harold
march
was
the
sort
of
man
who
knows
everything
about
politics
and
nothing
about
politicians
he
also
knew
a
great
deal
about
art
letters
philosophy
and
general
culture
about
almost
everything
indeed
except
the
world
he
was
living
in
abruptly
in
the
middle
of
those
sunny
and
windy
flats
he
came
upon
a
sort
of
cleft
almost
narrow
enough
to
be
called
a
crack
in
the
land
it
was
just
large
enough
to
be
the
water
-
course
for
a
small
stream
which
vanished
at
intervals
under
green
tunnels
of
undergrowth
as
if
in
a
dwarfish
forest
indeed
he
had
an
odd
feeling
as
if
he
were
a
giant
looking
over
the
valley
of
the
pygmies
when
he
dropped
into
the
hollow
however
the
impression
was
lost
the
rocky
banks
though
hardly
above
the
height
of
a
cottage
hung
over
and
had
the
profile
of
a
precipice
as
he
began
to
wander
down
the
course
of
the
stream
in
idle
but
romantic
curiosity
and
saw
the
water
shining
in
short
strips
between
the
great
gray
boulders
and
bushes
as
soft
as
great
green
mosses
he
fell
into
quite
an
opposite
vein
of
fantasy
it
was
rather
as
if
the
earth
had
opened
and
swallowed
him
into
a
sort
of
underworld
of
dreams
and
when
he
became
conscious
of
a
human
figure
dark
against
the
silver
stream
sitting
on
a
large
boulder
and
looking
rather
like
a
large
bird
it
was
perhaps
with
some
of
the
premonition
'
s
proper
to
a
man
who
meets
the
strangest
friendship
of
his
life
the
man
was
apparently
fishing
or
at
least
was
fixed
in
a
fisherman
'
s
attitude
with
more
than
a
fisherman
'
s
immobility
march
was
able
to
examine
the
man
almost
as
if
he
had
been
a
statue
for
some
minutes
before
the
statue
spoke
he
was
a
tall
fair
man
cadaverous
and
a
little
lackadaisical
with
heavy
eyelids
and
a
highbridged
nose
when
his
face
was
shaded
with
his
wide
white
hat
his
light
mustache
and
lithe
figure
gave
him
a
look
of
youth
but
the
panama
lay
on
the
moss
beside
him
and
the
spectator
could
see
that
his
brow
was
prematurely
bald
and
this
combined
with
a
certain
hollowness
about
the
eyes
had
an
air
of
headwork
and
even
headache
but
the
most
curious
thing
about
him
realized
after
a
short
scrutiny
was
that
though
he
looked
like
a
fisherman
he
was
not
fishing
he
was
holding
instead
of
a
rod
something
that
might
have
been
a
landing
-
net
which
some
fishermen
use
but
which
was
much
more
like
the
ordinary
toy
net
which
children
carry
and
which
they
generally
use
indifferently
for
shrimps
or
butterflies
he
was
dipping
this
into
the
water
at
intervals
gravely
regarding
its
harvest
of
weed
or
mud
and
emptying
it
out
again
no
i
have
not
caught
anything
he
remarked
calmly
as
if
answering
an
unspoken
query
when
i
do
i
have
to
throw
it
back
again
especially
the
big
fish
but
some
of
the
little
beasts
interest
me
when
i
get
'
em
a
scientific
interest
i
suppose
observed
march
of
a
rather
amateurish
sort
i
fear
answered
the
strange
fisherman
i
have
a
sort
of
hobby
about
what
they
call
phenomena
of
phosphorescence
but
it
would
be
rather
awkward
to
go
about
in
society
crying
stinking
fish
i
suppose
it
would
said
march
with
a
smile
rather
odd
to
enter
a
drawing
-
room
carrying
a
large
luminous
cod
continued
the
stranger
in
his
listless
way
how
quaint
it
would
be
if
one
could
carry
it
about
like
a
lantern
or
have
little
sprats
for
candles
some
of
the
seabeasts
would
really
be
very
pretty
like
lampshades
the
blue
sea
-
snail
that
glitters
all
over
like
starlight
and
some
of
the
red
starfish
really
shine
like
red
stars
but
naturally
i
am
not
looking
for
them
here
march
thought
of
asking
him
what
he
was
looking
for
but
feeling
unequal
to
a
technical
discussion
at
least
as
deep
as
the
deep
-
sea
fishes
he
returned
to
more
ordinary
topics
delightful
sort
of
hole
this
is
he
said
this
little
dell
and
river
here
it
is
like
those
places
stevenson
talks
about
where
something
ought
to
happen
i
know
answered
the
other
i
think
it
is
because
the
place
itself
so
to
speak
seems
to
happen
and
not
merely
to
exist
perhaps
that
'
s
what
old
picasso
and
some
of
the
cubists
are
trying
to
express
by
angles
and
jagged
lines
look
at
that
wall
like
low
cliffs
that
juts
forward
just
at
right
angles
to
the
slope
of
turf
sweeping
up
to
it
that
'
s
like
a
silent
collision
it
is
like
a
breaker
and
the
back
-
wash
of
a
wave
march
looked
at
the
low
-
browed
crag
overhanging
the
green
slope
and
nodded
he
was
interested
in
a
man
who
turned
so
easily
from
the
technicalities
of
science
to
those
of
art
and
asked
him
if
he
admired
the
new
angular
artists
as
i
feel
it
the
cubists
are
not
cubist
enough
replied
the
stranger
i
mean
they
are
not
thick
enough
by
making
things
mathematical
they
make
them
thin
take
the
living
lines
out
of
that
landscape
simplify
it
to
a
right
angle
and
you
flatten
it
out
to
a
mere
diagram
on
paper
diagrams
have
their
own
beauty
but
it
is
of
just
the
other
sort
they
stand
for
the
unalterable
things
the
calm
eternal
mathematical
sort
of
truths
what
somebody
calls
the
'
white
radiance
of
'
he
stopped
and
before
the
next
word
came
something
had
happened
almost
too
quickly
and
completely
to
be
realized
from
behind
the
overhanging
rock
came
a
noise
and
rush
like
that
of
a
railway
train
and
a
great
motor
car
appeared
it
topped
the
crest
of
cliff
black
against
the
sun
like
a
battle
-
chariot
rushing
to
destruction
in
some
wild
epic
march
automatically
put
out
his
hand
in
one
futile
gesture
as
if
to
catch
a
falling
tea
-
cup
in
a
drawing
-
room
for
the
fraction
of
a
flash
it
seemed
to
leave
the
ledge
of
rock
like
a
flying
ship
then
the
very
sky
seemed
to
turn
over
like
a
wheel
and
it
lay
a
ruin
amid
the
tall
grasses
below
a
line
of
gray
smoke
going
up
slowly
from
it
into
the
silent
air
a
little
lower
the
figure
of
a
man
with
gray
hair
lay
tumbled
down
the
steep
green
slope
his
limbs
lying
all
at
random
and
his
face
turned
away
the
eccentric
fisherman
dropped
his
net
and
walked
swiftly
toward
the
spot
his
new
acquaintance
following
him
as
they
drew
near
there
seemed
a
sort
of
monstrous
irony
in
the
fact
that
the
dead
machine
was
still
throbbing
and
thundering
as
busily
as
a
factory
while
the
man
lay
so
still
he
was
unquestionably
dead
the
blood
flowed
in
the
grass
from
a
hopelessly
fatal
fracture
at
the
back
of
the
skull
but
the
face
which
was
turned
to
the
sun
was
uninjured
and
strangely
arresting
in
itself
it
was
one
of
those
cases
of
a
strange
face
so
unmistakable
as
to
feel
familiar
we
feel
somehow
that
we
ought
to
recognize
it
even
though
we
do
not
it
was
of
the
broad
square
sort
with
great
jaws
almost
like
that
of
a
highly
intellectual
ape
the
wide
mouth
shut
so
tight
as
to
be
traced
by
a
mere
line
the
nose
short
with
the
sort
of
nostrils
that
seem
to
gape
with
an
appetite
for
the
air
the
oddest
thing
about
the
face
was
that
one
of
the
eyebrows
was
cocked
up
at
a
much
sharper
angle
than
the
other
march
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
face
so
naturally
alive
as
that
dead
one
and
its
ugly
energy
seemed
all
the
stranger
for
its
halo
of
hoary
hair
some
papers
lay
half
fallen
out
of
the
pocket
and
from
among
them
march
extracted
a
card
-
case
he
read
the
name
on
the
card
aloud
sir
humphrey
turnbull
i
am
sure
i
'
ve
heard
that
name
somewhere
his
companion
only
gave
a
sort
of
a
little
sigh
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
if
ruminating
then
he
merely
said
the
poor
fellow
is
quite
gone
and
added
some
scientific
terms
in
which
his
auditor
once
more
found
himself
out
of
his
depth
as
things
are
continued
the
same
curiously
well
-
informed
person
it
will
be
more
legal
for
us
to
leave
the
body
as
it
is
until
the
police
are
informed
in
fact
i
think
it
will
be
well
if
nobody
except
the
police
is
informed
do
not
be
surprised
if
i
seem
to
be
keeping
it
dark
from
some
of
our
neighbors
round
here
then
as
if
prompted
to
regularize
his
rather
abrupt
confidence
he
said
i
'
ve
come
down
to
see
my
cousin
at
torwood
my
name
is
horne
fisher
might
be
a
pun
on
my
pottering
about
here
might
not
it
is
sir
howard
horne
your
cousin
asked
march
i
am
going
to
torwood
park
to
see
him
myself
only
about
his
public
work
of
course
and
the
wonderful
stand
he
is
making
for
his
principles
i
think
this
budget
is
the
greatest
thing
in
english
history
if
it
fails
it
will
be
the
most
heroic
failure
in
english
history
are
you
an
admirer
of
your
great
kinsman
mr
fisher
rather
said
mr
fisher
he
is
the
best
shot
i
know
then
as
if
sincerely
repentant
of
his
nonchalance
he
added
with
a
sort
of
enthusiasm
no
but
really
he
is
a
beautiful
shot
as
if
fired
by
his
own
words
he
took
a
sort
of
leap
at
the
ledges
of
the
rock
above
him
and
scaled
them
with
a
sudden
agility
in
startling
contrast
to
his
general
lassitude
he
had
stood
for
some
seconds
on
the
headland
above
with
his
aquiline
profile
under
the
panama
hat
relieved
against
the
sky
and
peering
over
the
countryside
before
his
companion
had
collected
himself
sufficiently
to
scramble
up
after
him
the
level
above
was
a
stretch
of
common
turf
on
which
the
tracks
of
the
fated
car
were
plowed
plainly
enough
but
the
brink
of
it
was
broken
as
with
rocky
teeth
broken
boulders
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
lay
near
the
edge
it
was
almost
incredible
that
any
one
could
have
deliberately
driven
into
such
a
death
trap
especially
in
broad
daylight
i
ca
not
make
head
or
tail
of
it
said
march
was
he
blind
or
blind
drunk
neither
by
the
look
of
him
replied
the
other
then
it
was
suicide
it
does
not
seem
a
cozy
way
of
doing
it
remarked
the
man
called
fisher
besides
i
do
not
fancy
poor
old
puggy
would
commit
suicide
somehow
poor
old
who
inquired
the
wondering
journalist
did
you
know
this
unfortunate
man
nobody
knew
him
exactly
replied
fisher
with
some
vagueness
but
one
knew
him
of
course
he
'
d
been
a
terror
in
his
time
in
parliament
and
the
courts
and
so
on
especially
in
that
row
about
the
aliens
who
were
deported
as
undesirables
when
he
wanted
one
of
'
em
hanged
for
murder
he
was
so
sick
about
it
that
he
retired
from
the
bench
since
then
he
mostly
motored
about
by
himself
but
he
was
coming
to
torwood
too
for
the
week
-
end
and
i
do
not
see
why
he
should
deliberately
break
his
neck
almost
at
the
very
door
i
believe
hoggs
i
mean
my
cousin
howard
was
coming
down
specially
to
meet
him
torwood
park
does
not
belong
to
your
cousin
inquired
march
no
it
used
to
belong
to
the
winthrops
you
know
replied
the
other
now
a
new
man
'
s
got
it
a
man
from
montreal
named
jenkins
hoggs
comes
for
the
shooting
i
told
you
he
was
a
lovely
shot
this
repeated
eulogy
on
the
great
social
statesman
affected
harold
march
as
if
somebody
had
defined
napoleon
as
a
distinguished
player
of
nap
but
he
had
another
half
-
formed
impression
struggling
in
this
flood
of
unfamiliar
things
and
he
brought
it
to
the
surface
before
it
could
vanish
jenkins
he
repeated
surely
you
do
not
mean
jefferson
jenkins
the
social
reformer
i
mean
the
man
who
'
s
fighting
for
the
new
cottage
-
estate
scheme
it
would
be
as
interesting
to
meet
him
as
any
cabinet
minister
in
the
world
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
yes
hoggs
told
him
it
would
have
to
be
cottages
said
fisher
he
said
the
breed
of
cattle
had
improved
too
often
and
people
were
beginning
to
laugh
and
of
course
you
must
hang
a
peerage
on
to
something
though
the
poor
chap
has
not
got
it
yet
hullo
here
'
s
somebody
else
they
had
started
walking
in
the
tracks
of
the
car
leaving
it
behind
them
in
the
hollow
still
humming
horribly
like
a
huge
insect
that
had
killed
a
man
the
tracks
took
them
to
the
corner
of
the
road
one
arm
of
which
went
on
in
the
same
line
toward
the
distant
gates
of
the
park
it
was
clear
that
the
car
had
been
driven
down
the
long
straight
road
and
then
instead
of
turning
with
the
road
to
the
left
had
gone
straight
on
over
the
turf
to
its
doom
but
it
was
not
this
discovery
that
had
riveted
fisher
'
s
eye
but
something
even
more
solid
at
the
angle
of
the
white
road
a
dark
and
solitary
figure
was
standing
almost
as
still
as
a
finger
post
it
was
that
of
a
big
man
in
rough
shooting
-
clothes
bareheaded
and
with
tousled
curly
hair
that
gave
him
a
rather
wild
look
on
a
nearer
approach
this
first
more
fantastic
impression
faded
in
a
full
light
the
figure
took
on
more
conventional
colors
as
of
an
ordinary
gentleman
who
happened
to
have
come
out
without
a
hat
and
without
very
studiously
brushing
his
hair
but
the
massive
stature
remained
and
something
deep
and
even
cavernous
about
the
setting
of
the
eyes
redeemed
his
animal
good
looks
from
the
commonplace
but
march
had
no
time
to
study
the
man
more
closely
for
much
to
his
astonishment
his
guide
merely
observed
hullo
jack
and
walked
past
him
as
if
he
had
indeed
been
a
signpost
and
without
attempting
to
inform
him
of
the
catastrophe
beyond
the
rocks
it
was
relatively
a
small
thing
but
it
was
only
the
first
in
a
string
of
singular
antics
on
which
his
new
and
eccentric
friend
was
leading
him
the
man
they
had
passed
looked
after
them
in
rather
a
suspicious
fashion
but
fisher
continued
serenely
on
his
way
along
the
straight
road
that
ran
past
the
gates
of
the
great
estate
that
'
s
john
burke
the
traveler
he
condescended
to
explain
i
expect
you
'
ve
heard
of
him
shoots
big
game
and
all
that
sorry
i
could
not
stop
to
introduce
you
but
i
dare
say
you
will
meet
him
later
on
i
know
his
book
of
course
said
march
with
renewed
interest
that
is
certainly
a
fine
piece
of
description
about
their
being
only
conscious
of
the
closeness
of
the
elephant
when
the
colossal
head
blocked
out
the
moon
yes
young
halkett
writes
jolly
well
i
think
what
did
not
you
know
halkett
wrote
burke
'
s
book
for
him
burke
ca
not
use
anything
except
a
gun
and
you
ca
not
write
with
that
oh
he
is
genuine
enough
in
his
way
you
know
as
brave
as
a
lion
or
a
good
deal
braver
by
all
accounts
you
seem
to
know
all
about
him
observed
march
with
a
rather
bewildered
laugh
and
about
a
good
many
other
people
fisher
'
s
bald
brow
became
abruptly
corrugated
and
a
curious
expression
came
into
his
eyes
i
know
too
much
he
said
that
'
s
what
'
s
the
matter
with
me
that
'
s
what
'
s
the
matter
with
all
of
us
and
the
whole
show
we
know
too
much
too
much
about
one
another
too
much
about
ourselves
that
'
s
why
i
am
really
interested
just
now
about
one
thing
that
i
do
not
know
and
that
is
inquired
the
other
why
that
poor
fellow
is
dead
they
had
walked
along
the
straight
road
for
nearly
a
mile
conversing
at
intervals
in
this
fashion
and
march
had
a
singular
sense
of
the
whole
world
being
turned
inside
out
mr
horne
fisher
did
not
especially
abuse
his
friends
and
relatives
in
fashionable
society
of
some
of
them
he
spoke
with
affection
but
they
seemed
to
be
an
entirely
new
set
of
men
and
women
who
happened
to
have
the
same
nerves
as
the
men
and
women
mentioned
most
often
in
the
newspapers
yet
no
fury
of
revolt
could
have
seemed
to
him
more
utterly
revolutionary
than
this
cold
familiarity
it
was
like
daylight
on
the
other
side
of
stage
scenery
they
reached
the
great
lodge
gates
of
the
park
and
to
march
'
s
surprise
passed
them
and
continued
along
the
interminable
white
straight
road
but
he
was
himself
too
early
for
his
appointment
with
sir
howard
and
was
not
disinclined
to
see
the
end
of
his
new
friend
'
s
experiment
whatever
it
might
be
they
had
long
left
the
moorland
behind
them
and
half
the
white
road
was
gray
in
the
great
shadow
of
the
torwood
pine
forests
themselves
like
gray
bars
shuttered
against
the
sunshine
and
within
amid
that
clear
noon
manufacturing
their
own
midnight
soon
however
rifts
began
to
appear
in
them
like
gleams
of
colored
windows
the
trees
thinned
and
fell
away
as
the
road
went
forward
showing
the
wild
irregular
copses
in
which
as
fisher
said
the
house
-
party
had
been
blazing
away
all
day
and
about
two
hundred
yards
farther
on
they
came
to
the
first
turn
of
the
road
at
the
corner
stood
a
sort
of
decayed
inn
with
the
dingy
sign
of
the
grapes
the
signboard
was
dark
and
indecipherable
by
now
and
hung
black
against
the
sky
and
the
gray
moorland
beyond
about
as
inviting
as
a
gallows
march
remarked
that
it
looked
like
a
tavern
for
vinegar
instead
of
wine
a
good
phrase
said
fisher
and
so
it
would
be
if
you
were
silly
enough
to
drink
wine
in
it
but
the
beer
is
very
good
and
so
is
the
brandy
march
followed
him
to
the
bar
parlor
with
some
wonder
and
his
dim
sense
of
repugnance
was
not
dismissed
by
the
first
sight
of
the
innkeeper
who
was
widely
different
from
the
genial
innkeepers
of
romance
a
bony
man
very
silent
behind
a
black
mustache
but
with
black
restless
eyes
taciturn
as
he
was
the
investigator
succeeded
at
last
in
extracting
a
scrap
of
information
from
him
by
dint
of
ordering
beer
and
talking
to
him
persistently
and
minutely
on
the
subject
of
motor
cars
he
evidently
regarded
the
innkeeper
as
in
some
singular
way
an
authority
on
motor
cars
as
being
deep
in
the
secrets
of
the
mechanism
management
and
mismanagement
of
motor
cars
holding
the
man
all
the
time
with
a
glittering
eye
like
the
ancient
mariner
out
of
all
this
rather
mysterious
conversation
there
did
emerge
at
last
a
sort
of
admission
that
one
particular
motor
car
of
a
given
description
had
stopped
before
the
inn
about
an
hour
before
and
that
an
elderly
man
had
alighted
requiring
some
mechanical
assistance
asked
if
the
visitor
required
any
other
assistance
the
innkeeper
said
shortly
that
the
old
gentleman
had
filled
his
flask
and
taken
a
packet
of
sandwiches
and
with
these
words
the
somewhat
inhospitable
host
had
walked
hastily
out
of
the
bar
and
they
heard
him
banging
doors
in
the
dark
interior
fisher
'
s
weary
eye
wandered
round
the
dusty
and
dreary
inn
parlor
and
rested
dreamily
on
a
glass
case
containing
a
stuffed
bird
with
a
gun
hung
on
hooks
above
it
which
seemed
to
be
its
only
ornament
puggy
was
a
humorist
he
observed
at
least
in
his
own
rather
grim
style
but
it
seems
rather
too
grim
a
joke
for
a
man
to
buy
a
packet
of
sandwiches
when
he
is
just
going
to
commit
suicide
if
you
come
to
that
answered
march
it
is
not
very
usual
for
a
man
to
buy
a
packet
of
sandwiches
when
he
is
just
outside
the
door
of
a
grand
house
he
is
going
to
stop
at
no
no
repeated
fisher
almost
mechanically
and
then
suddenly
cocked
his
eye
at
his
interlocutor
with
a
much
livelier
expression
by
jove
that
'
s
an
idea
you
are
perfectly
right
and
that
suggests
a
very
queer
idea
does
not
it
there
was
a
silence
and
then
march
started
with
irrational
nervousness
as
the
door
of
the
inn
was
flung
open
and
another
man
walked
rapidly
to
the
counter
he
had
struck
it
with
a
coin
and
called
out
for
brandy
before
he
saw
the
other
two
guests
who
were
sitting
at
a
bare
wooden
table
under
the
window
when
he
turned
about
with
a
rather
wild
stare
march
had
yet
another
unexpected
emotion
for
his
guide
hailed
the
man
as
hoggs
and
introduced
him
as
sir
howard
horne
he
looked
rather
older
than
his
boyish
portraits
in
the
illustrated
papers
as
is
the
way
of
politicians
his
flat
fair
hair
was
touched
with
gray
but
his
face
was
almost
comically
round
with
a
roman
nose
which
when
combined
with
his
quick
bright
eyes
raised
a
vague
reminiscence
of
a
parrot
he
had
a
cap
rather
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
a
gun
under
his
arm
harold
march
had
imagined
many
things
about
his
meeting
with
the
great
political
reformer
but
he
had
never
pictured
him
with
a
gun
under
his
arm
drinking
brandy
in
a
public
house
so
you
are
stopping
at
jink
'
s
too
said
fisher
everybody
seems
to
be
at
jink
'
s
yes
replied
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
jolly
good
shooting
at
least
all
of
it
that
is
not
jink
'
s
shooting
i
never
knew
a
chap
with
such
good
shooting
that
was
such
a
bad
shot
mind
you
he
is
a
jolly
good
fellow
and
all
that
i
do
not
say
a
word
against
him
but
he
never
learned
to
hold
a
gun
when
he
was
packing
pork
or
whatever
he
did
they
say
he
shot
the
cockade
off
his
own
servant
'
s
hat
just
like
him
to
have
cockades
of
course
he
shot
the
weathercock
off
his
own
ridiculous
gilded
summerhouse
it
is
the
only
cock
he
will
ever
kill
i
should
think
are
you
coming
up
there
now
fisher
said
rather
vaguely
that
he
was
following
soon
when
he
had
fixed
something
up
and
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
left
the
inn
march
fancied
he
had
been
a
little
upset
or
impatient
when
he
called
for
the
brandy
but
he
had
talked
himself
back
into
a
satisfactory
state
if
the
talk
had
not
been
quite
what
his
literary
visitor
had
expected
fisher
a
few
minutes
afterward
slowly
led
the
way
out
of
the
tavern
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
looking
down
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
traveled
then
he
walked
back
about
two
hundred
yards
in
that
direction
and
stood
still
again
i
should
think
this
is
about
the
place
he
said
what
place
asked
his
companion
the
place
where
the
poor
fellow
was
killed
said
fisher
sadly
what
do
you
mean
demanded
march
he
was
smashed
up
on
the
rocks
a
mile
and
a
half
from
here
no
he
was
not
replied
fisher
he
did
not
fall
on
the
rocks
at
all
did
not
you
notice
that
he
only
fell
on
the
slope
of
soft
grass
underneath
but
i
saw
that
he
had
a
bullet
in
him
already
then
after
a
pause
he
added
he
was
alive
at
the
inn
but
he
was
dead
long
before
he
came
to
the
rocks
so
he
was
shot
as
he
drove
his
car
down
this
strip
of
straight
road
and
i
should
think
somewhere
about
here
after
that
of
course
the
car
went
straight
on
with
nobody
to
stop
or
turn
it
it
is
really
a
very
cunning
dodge
in
its
way
for
the
body
would
be
found
far
away
and
most
people
would
say
as
you
do
that
it
was
an
accident
to
a
motorist
the
murderer
must
have
been
a
clever
brute
but
would
not
the
shot
be
heard
at
the
inn
or
somewhere
asked
march
it
would
be
heard
but
it
would
not
be
noticed
that
continued
the
investigator
is
where
he
was
clever
again
shooting
was
going
on
all
over
the
place
all
day
very
likely
he
timed
his
shot
so
as
to
drown
it
in
a
number
of
others
certainly
he
was
a
first
-
class
criminal
and
he
was
something
else
as
well
what
do
you
mean
asked
his
companion
with
a
creepy
premonition
of
something
coming
he
knew
not
why
he
was
a
first
-
class
shot
said
fisher
he
had
turned
his
back
abruptly
and
was
walking
down
a
narrow
grassy
lane
little
more
than
a
cart
track
which
lay
opposite
the
inn
and
marked
the
end
of
the
great
estate
and
the
beginning
of
the
open
moors
march
plodded
after
him
with
the
same
idle
perseverance
and
found
him
staring
through
a
gap
in
giant
weeds
and
thorns
at
the
flat
face
of
a
painted
paling
from
behind
the
paling
rose
the
great
gray
columns
of
a
row
of
poplars
which
filled
the
heavens
above
them
with
dark
-
green
shadow
and
shook
faintly
in
a
wind
which
had
sunk
slowly
into
a
breeze
the
afternoon
was
already
deepening
into
evening
and
the
titanic
shadows
of
the
poplars
lengthened
over
a
third
of
the
landscape
are
you
a
first
-
class
criminal
asked
fisher
in
a
friendly
tone
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
but
i
think
i
can
manage
to
be
a
sort
of
fourth
-
rate
burglar
and
before
his
companion
could
reply
he
had
managed
to
swing
himself
up
and
over
the
fence
march
followed
without
much
bodily
effort
but
with
considerable
mental
disturbance
the
poplars
grew
so
close
against
the
fence
that
they
had
some
difficulty
in
slipping
past
them
and
beyond
the
poplars
they
could
see
only
a
high
hedge
of
laurel
green
and
lustrous
in
the
level
sun
something
in
this
limitation
by
a
series
of
living
walls
made
him
feel
as
if
he
were
really
entering
a
shattered
house
instead
of
an
open
field
it
was
as
if
he
came
in
by
a
disused
door
or
window
and
found
the
way
blocked
by
furniture
when
they
had
circumvented
the
laurel
hedge
they
came
out
on
a
sort
of
terrace
of
turf
which
fell
by
one
green
step
to
an
oblong
lawn
like
a
bowling
green
beyond
this
was
the
only
building
in
sight
a
low
conservatory
which
seemed
far
away
from
anywhere
like
a
glass
cottage
standing
in
its
own
fields
in
fairyland
fisher
knew
that
lonely
look
of
the
outlying
parts
of
a
great
house
well
enough
he
realized
that
it
is
more
of
a
satire
on
aristocracy
than
if
it
were
choked
with
weeds
and
littered
with
ruins
for
it
is
not
neglected
and
yet
it
is
deserted
at
any
rate
it
is
disused
it
is
regularly
swept
and
garnished
for
a
master
who
never
comes
looking
over
the
lawn
however
he
saw
one
object
which
he
had
not
apparently
expected
it
was
a
sort
of
tripod
supporting
a
large
disk
like
the
round
top
of
a
table
tipped
sideways
and
it
was
not
until
they
had
dropped
on
to
the
lawn
and
walked
across
to
look
at
it
that
march
realized
that
it
was
a
target
it
was
worn
and
weatherstained
the
gay
colors
of
its
concentric
rings
were
faded
possibly
it
had
been
set
up
in
those
far
-
off
victorian
days
when
there
was
a
fashion
of
archery
march
had
one
of
his
vague
visions
of
ladies
in
cloudy
crinolines
and
gentlemen
in
outlandish
hats
and
whiskers
revisiting
that
lost
garden
like
ghosts
fisher
who
was
peering
more
closely
at
the
target
startled
him
by
an
exclamation
hullo
he
said
somebody
has
been
peppering
this
thing
with
shot
after
all
and
quite
lately
too
why
i
believe
old
jink
'
s
been
trying
to
improve
his
bad
shooting
here
yes
and
it
looks
as
if
it
still
wanted
improving
answered
march
laughing
not
one
of
these
shots
is
anywhere
near
the
bull
'
s
-
eye
they
seem
just
scattered
about
in
the
wildest
way
in
the
wildest
way
repeated
fisher
still
peering
intently
at
the
target
he
seemed
merely
to
assent
but
march
fancied
his
eye
was
shining
under
its
sleepy
lid
and
that
he
straightened
his
stooping
figure
with
a
strange
effort
excuse
me
a
moment
he
said
feeling
in
his
pockets
i
think
i
'
ve
got
some
of
my
chemicals
and
after
that
we
will
go
up
to
the
house
and
he
stooped
again
over
the
target
putting
something
with
his
finger
over
each
of
the
shot
-
holes
so
far
as
march
could
see
merely
a
dull
-
gray
smear
then
they
went
through
the
gathering
twilight
up
the
long
green
avenues
to
the
great
house
here
again
however
the
eccentric
investigator
did
not
enter
by
the
front
door
he
walked
round
the
house
until
he
found
a
window
open
and
leaping
into
it
introduced
his
friend
to
what
appeared
to
be
the
gun
-
room
rows
of
the
regular
instruments
for
bringing
down
birds
stood
against
the
walls
but
across
a
table
in
the
window
lay
one
or
two
weapons
of
a
heavier
and
more
formidable
pattern
hullo
i
these
are
burke
'
s
big
-
game
rifles
said
fisher
i
never
knew
he
kept
them
here
he
lifted
one
of
them
examined
it
briefly
and
put
it
down
again
frowning
heavily
almost
as
he
did
so
a
strange
young
man
came
hurriedly
into
the
room
he
was
dark
and
sturdy
with
a
bumpy
forehead
and
a
bulldog
jaw
and
he
spoke
with
a
curt
apology
i
left
major
burke
'
s
guns
here
he
said
and
he
wants
them
packed
up
he
is
going
away
to
-
night
and
he
carried
off
the
two
rifles
without
casting
a
glance
at
the
stranger
through
the
open
window
they
could
see
his
short
dark
figure
walking
away
across
the
glimmering
garden
fisher
got
out
of
the
window
again
and
stood
looking
after
him
that
'
s
halkett
whom
i
told
you
about
he
said
i
knew
he
was
a
sort
of
secretary
and
had
to
do
with
burke
'
s
papers
but
i
never
knew
he
had
anything
to
do
with
his
guns
but
he
is
just
the
sort
of
silent
sensible
little
devil
who
might
be
very
good
at
anything
the
sort
of
man
you
know
for
years
before
you
find
he
is
a
chess
champion
he
had
begun
to
walk
in
the
direction
of
the
disappearing
secretary
and
they
soon
came
within
sight
of
the
rest
of
the
house
-
party
talking
and
laughing
on
the
lawn
they
could
see
the
tall
figure
and
loose
mane
of
the
lion
-
hunter
dominating
the
little
group
by
the
way
observed
fisher
when
we
were
talking
about
burke
and
halkett
i
said
that
a
man
could
not
very
well
write
with
a
gun
well
i
am
not
so
sure
now
did
you
ever
hear
of
an
artist
so
clever
that
he
could
draw
with
a
gun
there
'
s
a
wonderful
chap
loose
about
here
sir
howard
hailed
fisher
and
his
friend
the
journalist
with
almost
boisterous
amiability
the
latter
was
presented
to
major
burke
and
mr
halkett
and
also
(
by
way
of
a
parenthesis
)
to
his
host
mr
jenkins
a
commonplace
little
man
in
loud
tweeds
whom
everybody
else
seemed
to
treat
with
a
sort
of
affection
as
if
he
were
a
baby
the
irrepressible
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
was
still
talking
about
the
birds
he
had
brought
down
the
birds
that
burke
and
halkett
had
brought
down
and
the
birds
that
jenkins
their
host
had
failed
to
bring
down
it
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
sociable
monomania
you
and
your
big
game
he
ejaculated
aggressively
to
burke
why
anybody
could
shoot
big
game
you
want
to
be
a
shot
to
shoot
small
game
quite
so
interposed
horne
fisher
now
if
only
a
hippopotamus
could
fly
up
in
the
air
out
of
that
bush
or
you
preserved
flying
elephants
on
the
estate
why
then
why
even
jink
might
hit
that
sort
of
bird
cried
sir
howard
hilariously
slapping
his
host
on
the
back
even
he
might
hit
a
haystack
or
a
hippopotamus
look
here
you
fellows
said
fisher
i
want
you
to
come
along
with
me
for
a
minute
and
shoot
at
something
else
not
a
hippopotamus
another
kind
of
queer
animal
i
'
ve
found
on
the
estate
it
is
an
animal
with
three
legs
and
one
eye
and
it
is
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
what
the
deuce
are
you
talking
about
asked
burke
you
come
along
and
see
replied
fisher
cheerfully
such
people
seldom
reject
anything
nonsensical
for
they
are
always
seeking
for
somethingnew
they
gravely
rearmed
themselves
fromthe
gun
-
room
and
trooped
along
at
the
tail
of
their
guide
sir
howard
only
pausing
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
to
point
out
the
celebrated
gilt
summerhouse
on
which
the
gilt
weathercock
still
stood
crooked
it
was
dusk
turning
to
dark
by
the
time
they
reached
the
remote
green
by
the
poplars
and
accepted
the
new
and
aimless
game
of
shooting
at
the
old
mark
the
last
light
seemed
to
fade
from
the
lawn
and
the
poplars
against
the
sunset
were
like
great
plumes
upon
a
purple
hearse
when
the
futile
procession
finally
curved
round
and
came
out
in
front
of
the
target
sir
howard
again
slapped
his
host
on
the
shoulder
shoving
him
playfully
forward
to
take
the
first
shot
the
shoulder
and
arm
he
touched
seemed
unnaturally
stiff
and
angular
mr
jenkins
was
holding
his
gun
in
an
attitude
more
awkward
than
any
that
his
satiric
friends
had
seen
or
expected
at
the
same
instant
a
horrible
scream
seemed
to
come
from
nowhere
it
was
so
unnatural
and
so
unsuited
to
the
scene
that
it
might
have
been
made
by
some
inhuman
thing
flying
on
wings
above
them
or
eavesdropping
in
the
dark
woods
beyond
but
fisher
knew
that
it
had
started
and
stopped
on
the
pale
lips
of
jefferson
jenkins
of
montreal
and
no
one
at
that
moment
catching
sight
of
jefferson
jenkins
'
s
face
would
have
complained
that
it
was
commonplace
the
next
moment
a
torrent
of
guttural
but
good
-
humored
oaths
came
from
major
burke
as
he
and
the
two
other
men
saw
what
was
in
front
of
them
the
target
stood
up
in
the
dim
grass
like
a
dark
goblin
grinning
at
them
and
it
was
literally
grinning
it
had
two
eyes
like
stars
and
in
similar
livid
points
of
light
were
picked
out
the
two
upturned
and
open
nostrils
and
the
two
ends
of
the
wide
and
tight
mouth
a
few
white
dots
above
each
eye
indicated
the
hoary
eyebrows
and
one
of
them
ran
upward
almost
erect
it
was
a
brilliant
caricature
done
in
bright
botted
lines
and
march
knew
of
whom
it
shone
in
the
shadowy
grass
smeared
with
sea
fire
as
if
one
of
the
submarine
monsters
had
crawled
into
the
twilight
garden
but
it
had
the
head
of
a
dead
man
it
is
only
luminous
paint
said
burke
old
fisher
'
s
been
having
a
joke
with
that
phosphorescent
stuff
of
his
seems
to
be
meant
for
old
puggy
'
observed
sir
howard
hits
him
off
very
well
with
that
they
all
laughed
except
jenkins
when
they
had
all
done
he
made
a
noise
like
the
first
effort
of
an
animal
to
laugh
and
horne
fisher
suddenly
strode
across
to
him
and
said
mr
jenkins
i
must
speak
to
you
at
once
in
private
it
was
by
the
little
watercourse
in
the
moors
on
the
slope
under
the
hanging
rock
that
march
met
his
new
friend
fisher
by
appointment
shortly
after
the
ugly
and
almost
grotesque
scene
that
had
broken
up
the
group
in
the
garden
it
was
a
monkey
-
trick
of
mine
observed
fisher
gloomily
putting
phosphorus
on
the
target
but
the
only
chance
to
make
him
jump
was
to
give
him
the
horrors
suddenly
and
when
he
saw
the
face
he
'
d
shot
at
shining
on
the
target
he
practiced
on
all
lit
up
with
an
infernal
light
he
did
jump
quite
enough
for
my
own
intellectual
satisfaction
i
am
afraid
i
do
not
quite
understand
even
now
said
march
exactly
what
he
did
or
why
he
did
it
you
ought
to
replied
fisher
with
his
rather
dreary
smile
for
you
gave
me
the
first
suggestion
yourself
oh
yes
you
did
and
it
was
a
very
shrewd
one
you
said
a
man
would
not
take
sandwiches
with
him
to
dine
at
a
great
house
it
was
quite
true
and
the
inference
was
that
though
he
was
going
there
he
did
not
mean
to
dine
there
or
at
any
rate
that
he
might
not
be
dining
there
it
occurred
to
me
at
once
that
he
probably
expected
the
visit
to
be
unpleasant
or
the
reception
doubtful
or
something
that
would
prevent
his
accepting
hospitality
then
it
struck
me
that
turnbull
was
a
terror
to
certain
shady
characters
in
the
past
and
that
he
had
come
down
to
identify
and
denounce
one
of
them
the
chances
at
the
start
pointed
to
the
host
that
is
jenkins
i
am
morally
certain
now
that
jenkins
was
the
undesirable
alien
turnbull
wanted
to
convict
in
another
shooting
-
affair
but
you
see
the
shooting
gentleman
had
another
shot
in
his
locker
but
you
said
he
would
have
to
be
a
very
good
shot
protested
march
jenkins
is
a
very
good
shot
said
fisher
a
very
good
shot
who
can
pretend
to
be
a
very
bad
shot
shall
i
tell
you
the
second
hint
i
hit
on
after
yours
to
make
me
think
it
was
jenkins
it
was
my
cousin
'
s
account
of
his
bad
shooting
he
'
d
shot
a
cockade
off
a
hat
and
a
weathercock
off
a
building
now
in
fact
a
man
must
shoot
very
well
indeed
to
shoot
so
badly
as
that
he
must
shoot
very
neatly
to
hit
the
cockade
and
not
the
head
or
even
the
hat
if
the
shots
had
really
gone
at
random
the
chances
are
a
thousand
to
one
that
they
would
not
have
hit
such
prominent
and
picturesque
objects
they
were
chosen
because
they
were
prominent
and
picturesque
objects
they
make
a
story
to
go
the
round
of
society
he
keeps
the
crooked
weathercock
in
the
summerhouse
to
perpetuate
the
story
of
a
legend
and
then
he
lay
in
wait
with
his
evil
eye
and
wicked
gun
safely
ambushed
behind
the
legend
of
his
own
incompetence
but
there
is
more
than
that
there
is
the
summerhouse
itself
i
mean
there
is
the
whole
thing
there
'
s
all
that
jenkins
gets
chaffed
about
the
gilding
and
the
gaudy
colors
and
all
the
vulgarity
that
'
s
supposed
to
stamp
him
as
an
upstart
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
upstarts
generally
do
not
do
this
god
knows
there
'
s
enough
of
'
em
in
society
and
one
knows
'
em
well
enough
and
this
is
the
very
last
thing
they
do
they
are
generally
only
too
keen
to
know
the
right
thing
and
do
it
and
they
instantly
put
themselves
body
and
soul
into
the
hands
of
art
decorators
and
art
experts
who
do
the
whole
thing
for
them
there
'
s
hardly
another
millionaire
alive
who
has
the
moral
courage
to
have
a
gilt
monogram
on
a
chair
like
that
one
in
the
gun
-
room
for
that
matter
there
'
s
the
name
as
well
as
the
monogram
names
like
tompkins
and
jenkins
and
jinks
are
funny
without
being
vulgar
i
mean
they
are
vulgar
without
being
common
if
you
prefer
it
they
are
commonplace
without
being
common
they
are
just
the
names
to
be
chosen
to
look
ordinary
but
they
are
really
rather
extraordinary
do
you
know
many
people
called
tompkins
it
is
a
good
deal
rarer
than
talbot
it
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
the
comic
clothes
of
the
parvenu
jenkins
dresses
like
a
character
in
punch
but
that
'
s
because
he
is
a
character
in
punch
i
mean
he
is
a
fictitious
character
he
is
a
fabulous
animal
he
does
not
exist
have
you
ever
considered
what
it
must
be
like
to
be
a
man
who
does
not
exist
i
mean
to
be
a
man
with
a
fictitious
character
that
he
has
to
keep
up
at
the
expense
not
merely
of
personal
talents
to
be
a
new
kind
of
hypocrite
hiding
a
talent
in
a
new
kind
of
napkin
this
man
has
chosen
his
hypocrisy
very
ingeniously
it
was
really
a
new
one
a
subtle
villain
has
dressed
up
as
a
dashing
gentleman
and
a
worthy
business
man
and
a
philanthropist
and
a
saint
but
the
loud
checks
of
a
comical
little
cad
were
really
rather
a
new
disguise
but
the
disguise
must
be
very
irksome
to
a
man
who
can
really
do
things
this
is
a
dexterous
little
cosmopolitan
guttersnipe
who
can
do
scores
of
things
not
only
shoot
but
draw
and
paint
and
probably
play
the
fiddle
now
a
man
like
that
may
find
the
hiding
of
his
talents
useful
but
he
could
never
help
wanting
to
use
them
where
they
were
useless
if
he
can
draw
he
will
draw
absent
-
mindedly
on
blotting
paper
i
suspect
this
rascal
has
often
drawn
poor
old
puggy
'
s
face
on
blotting
paper
probably
he
began
doing
it
in
blots
as
he
afterward
did
it
in
dots
or
rather
shots
it
was
the
same
sort
of
thing
he
found
a
disused
target
in
a
deserted
yard
and
could
not
resist
indulging
in
a
little
secret
shooting
like
secret
drinking
you
thought
the
shots
all
scattered
and
irregular
and
so
they
were
but
not
accidental
no
two
distances
were
alike
but
the
different
points
were
exactly
where
he
wanted
to
put
them
there
'
s
nothing
needs
such
mathematical
precision
as
a
wild
caricature
i
'
ve
dabbled
a
little
in
drawing
myself
and
i
assure
you
that
to
put
one
dot
where
you
want
it
is
a
marvel
with
a
pen
close
to
a
piece
of
paper
it
was
a
miracle
to
do
it
across
a
garden
with
a
gun
but
a
man
who
can
work
those
miracles
will
always
itch
to
work
them
if
it
is
only
in
the
dark
after
a
pause
march
observed
thoughtfully
but
he
could
not
have
brought
him
down
like
a
bird
with
one
of
those
little
guns
no
that
was
why
i
went
into
the
gun
-
room
replied
fisher
he
did
it
with
one
of
burke
'
s
rifles
and
burke
thought
he
knew
the
sound
of
it
that
'
s
why
he
rushed
out
without
a
hat
looking
so
wild
he
saw
nothing
but
a
car
passing
quickly
which
he
followed
for
a
little
way
and
then
concluded
he
'
d
made
a
mistake
there
was
another
silence
during
which
fisher
sat
on
a
great
stone
as
motionless
as
on
their
first
meeting
and
watched
the
gray
and
silver
river
eddying
past
under
the
bushes
then
march
said
abruptly
of
course
he
knows
the
truth
now
nobody
knows
the
truth
but
you
and
i
answered
fisher
with
a
certain
softening
in
his
voice
and
i
do
not
think
you
and
i
will
ever
quarrel
what
do
you
mean
asked
march
in
an
altered
accent
what
have
you
done
about
it
horne
fisher
continued
to
gaze
steadily
at
the
eddying
stream
at
last
he
said
the
police
have
proved
it
was
a
motor
accident
but
you
know
it
was
not
i
told
you
that
i
know
too
much
replied
fisher
with
his
eye
on
the
river
i
know
that
and
i
know
a
great
many
other
things
i
know
the
atmosphere
and
the
way
the
whole
thing
works
i
know
this
fellow
has
succeeded
in
making
himself
something
incurably
commonplace
and
comic
i
know
you
ca
not
get
up
a
persecution
of
old
toole
or
little
tich
if
i
were
to
tell
hoggs
or
halkett
that
old
jink
was
an
assassin
they
would
almost
die
of
laughter
before
my
eyes
oh
i
do
not
say
their
laughter
'
s
quite
innocent
though
it
is
genuine
in
its
way
they
want
old
jink
and
they
could
not
do
without
him
i
do
not
say
i
am
quite
innocent
i
like
hoggs
i
do
not
want
him
to
be
down
and
out
and
he
'
d
be
done
for
if
jink
ca
not
pay
for
his
coronet
they
were
devilish
near
the
line
at
the
last
election
but
the
only
real
objection
to
it
is
that
it
is
impossible
nobody
would
believe
it
it
is
not
in
the
picture
the
crooked
weathercock
would
always
turn
it
into
a
joke
do
not
you
think
this
is
infamous
asked
march
quietly
i
think
a
good
many
things
replied
the
other
if
you
people
ever
happen
to
blow
the
whole
tangle
of
society
to
hell
with
dynamite
i
do
not
know
that
the
human
race
will
be
much
the
worse
but
do
not
be
too
hard
on
me
merely
because
i
know
what
society
is
that
'
s
why
i
moon
away
my
time
over
things
like
stinking
fish
there
was
a
pause
as
he
settled
himself
down
again
by
the
stream
and
then
he
added
i
told
you
before
i
had
to
throw
back
the
big
fish
this
tale
begins
among
a
tangle
of
tales
round
a
name
that
is
at
once
recent
and
legendary
the
name
is
that
of
michael
o
'
neill
popularly
called
prince
michael
partly
because
he
claimed
descent
from
ancient
fenian
princes
and
partly
because
he
was
credited
with
a
plan
to
make
himself
prince
president
of
ireland
as
the
last
napoleon
did
of
france
he
was
undoubtedly
a
gentleman
of
honorable
pedigree
and
of
many
accomplishments
but
two
of
his
accomplishments
emerged
from
all
the
rest
he
had
a
talent
for
appearing
when
he
was
not
wanted
and
a
talent
for
disappearing
when
he
was
wanted
especially
when
he
was
wanted
by
the
police
it
may
be
added
that
his
disappearances
were
more
dangerous
than
his
appearances
in
the
latter
he
seldom
went
beyond
the
sensational
pasting
up
seditious
placards
tearing
down
official
placards
making
flamboyant
speeches
or
unfurling
forbidden
flags
but
in
order
to
effect
the
former
he
would
sometimes
fight
for
his
freedom
with
startling
energy
from
which
men
were
sometimes
lucky
to
escape
with
a
broken
head
instead
of
a
broken
neck
his
most
famous
feats
of
escape
however
were
due
to
dexterity
and
not
to
violence
on
a
cloudless
summer
morning
he
had
come
down
a
country
road
white
with
dust
and
pausing
outside
a
farmhouse
had
told
the
farmer
'
s
daughter
with
elegant
indifference
that
the
local
police
were
in
pursuit
of
him
the
girl
'
s
name
was
bridget
royce
a
somber
and
even
sullen
type
of
beauty
and
she
looked
at
him
darkly
as
if
in
doubt
and
said
do
you
want
me
to
hide
you
upon
which
he
only
laughed
leaped
lightly
over
the
stone
wall
and
strode
toward
the
farm
merely
throwing
over
his
shoulder
the
remark
thank
you
i
have
generally
been
quite
capable
of
hiding
myself
in
which
proceeding
he
acted
with
a
tragic
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
women
and
there
fell
on
his
path
in
that
sunshine
a
shadow
of
doom
while
he
disappeared
through
the
farmhouse
the
girl
remained
for
a
few
moments
looking
up
the
road
and
two
perspiring
policemen
came
plowing
up
to
the
door
where
she
stood
though
still
angry
she
was
still
silent
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
officers
had
searched
the
house
and
were
already
inspecting
the
kitchen
garden
and
cornfield
behind
it
in
the
ugly
reaction
of
her
mood
she
might
have
been
tempted
even
to
point
out
the
fugitive
but
for
a
small
difficulty
that
she
had
no
more
notion
than
the
policemen
had
of
where
he
could
possibly
have
gone
the
kitchen
garden
was
inclosed
by
a
very
low
wall
and
the
cornfield
beyond
lay
aslant
like
a
square
patch
on
a
great
green
hill
on
which
he
could
still
have
been
seen
even
as
a
dot
in
the
distance
everything
stood
solid
in
its
familiar
place
the
apple
tree
was
too
small
to
support
or
hide
a
climber
the
only
shed
stood
open
and
obviously
empty
there
was
no
sound
save
the
droning
of
summer
flies
and
the
occasional
flutter
of
a
bird
unfamiliar
enough
to
be
surprised
by
the
scarecrow
in
the
field
there
was
scarcely
a
shadow
save
a
few
blue
lines
that
fell
from
the
thin
tree
every
detail
was
picked
out
by
the
brilliant
day
light
as
if
in
a
microscope
the
girl
described
the
scene
later
with
all
the
passionate
realism
of
her
race
and
whether
or
no
the
policemen
had
a
similar
eye
for
the
picturesque
they
had
at
least
an
eye
for
the
facts
of
the
case
and
were
compelled
to
give
up
the
chase
and
retire
from
the
scene
bridget
royce
remained
as
if
in
a
trance
staring
at
the
sunlit
garden
in
which
a
man
had
just
vanished
like
a
fairy
she
was
still
in
a
sinister
mood
and
the
miracle
took
in
her
mind
a
character
of
unfriendliness
and
fear
as
if
the
fairy
were
decidedly
a
bad
fairy
the
sun
upon
the
glittering
garden
depressed
her
more
than
the
darkness
but
she
continued
to
stare
at
it
then
the
world
itself
went
half
-
witted
and
she
screamed
the
scarecrow
moved
in
the
sun
light
it
had
stood
with
its
back
to
her
in
a
battered
old
black
hat
and
a
tattered
garment
and
with
all
its
tatters
flying
it
strode
away
across
the
hill
she
did
not
analyze
the
audacious
trick
by
which
the
man
had
turned
to
his
advantage
the
subtle
effects
of
the
expected
and
the
obvious
she
was
still
under
the
cloud
of
more
individual
complexities
and
she
noticed
must
of
all
that
the
vanishing
scarecrow
did
not
even
turn
to
look
at
the
farm
and
the
fates
that
were
running
so
adverse
to
his
fantastic
career
of
freedom
ruled
that
his
next
adventure
though
it
had
the
same
success
in
another
quarter
should
increase
the
danger
in
this
quarter
among
the
many
similar
adventures
related
of
him
in
this
manner
it
is
also
said
that
some
days
afterward
another
girl
named
mary
cregan
found
him
concealed
on
the
farm
where
she
worked
and
if
the
story
is
true
she
must
also
have
had
the
shock
of
an
uncanny
experience
for
when
she
was
busy
at
some
lonely
task
in
the
yard
she
heard
a
voice
speaking
out
of
the
well
and
found
that
the
eccentric
had
managed
to
drop
himself
into
the
bucket
which
was
some
little
way
below
the
well
only
partly
full
of
water
in
this
case
however
he
had
to
appeal
to
the
woman
to
wind
up
the
rope
and
men
say
it
was
when
this
news
was
told
to
the
other
woman
that
her
soul
walked
over
the
border
line
of
treason
such
at
least
were
the
stories
told
of
him
in
the
countryside
and
there
were
many
more
as
that
he
had
stood
insolently
in
a
splendid
green
dressing
gown
on
the
steps
of
a
great
hotel
and
then
led
the
police
a
chase
through
a
long
suite
of
grand
apartments
and
finally
through
his
own
bedroom
on
to
a
balcony
that
overhung
the
river
the
moment
the
pursuers
stepped
on
to
the
balcony
it
broke
under
them
and
they
dropped
pell
-
mell
into
the
eddying
waters
while
michael
who
had
thrown
off
his
gown
and
dived
was
able
to
swim
away
it
was
said
that
he
had
carefully
cut
away
the
props
so
that
they
would
not
support
anything
so
heavy
as
a
policeman
but
here
again
he
was
immediately
fortunate
yet
ultimately
unfortunate
for
it
is
said
that
one
of
the
men
was
drowned
leaving
a
family
feud
which
made
a
little
rift
in
his
popularity
these
stories
can
now
be
told
in
some
detail
not
because
they
are
the
most
marvellous
of
his
many
adventures
but
because
these
alone
were
not
covered
with
silence
by
the
loyalty
of
the
peasantry
these
alone
found
their
way
into
official
reports
and
it
is
these
which
three
of
the
chief
officials
of
the
country
were
reading
and
discussing
when
the
more
remarkable
part
of
this
story
begins
night
was
far
advanced
and
the
lights
shone
in
the
cottage
that
served
for
a
temporary
police
station
near
the
coast
on
one
side
of
it
were
the
last
houses
of
the
straggling
village
and
on
the
other
nothing
but
a
waste
moorland
stretching
away
toward
the
sea
the
line
of
which
was
broken
by
no
landmark
except
a
solitary
tower
of
the
prehistoric
pattern
still
found
in
ireland
standing
up
as
slender
as
a
column
but
pointed
like
a
pyramid
at
a
wooden
table
in
front
of
the
window
which
normally
looked
out
on
this
landscape
sat
two
men
in
plain
clothes
but
with
something
of
a
military
bearing
for
indeed
they
were
the
two
chiefs
of
the
detective
service
of
that
district
the
senior
of
the
two
both
in
age
and
rank
was
a
sturdy
man
with
a
short
white
beard
and
frosty
eyebrows
fixed
in
a
frown
which
suggested
rather
worry
than
severity
his
name
was
morton
and
he
was
a
liverpool
man
long
pickled
in
the
irish
quarrels
and
doing
his
duty
among
them
in
a
sour
fashion
not
altogether
unsympathetic
he
had
spoken
a
few
sentences
to
his
companion
nolan
a
tall
dark
man
with
a
cadaverous
equine
irish
face
when
he
seemed
to
remember
something
and
touched
a
bell
which
rang
in
another
room
the
subordinate
he
had
summoned
immediately
appeared
with
a
sheaf
of
papers
in
his
hand
sit
down
wilson
he
said
those
are
the
dispositions
i
suppose
yes
replied
the
third
officer
i
think
i
'
ve
got
all
there
is
to
be
got
out
of
them
so
i
sent
the
people
away
did
mary
cregan
give
evidence
asked
morton
with
a
frown
that
looked
a
little
heavier
than
usual
no
but
her
master
did
answered
the
man
called
wilson
who
had
flat
red
hair
and
a
plain
pale
face
not
without
sharpness
i
think
he
is
hanging
round
the
girl
himself
and
is
out
against
a
rival
there
'
s
always
some
reason
of
that
sort
when
we
are
told
the
truth
about
anything
and
you
bet
the
other
girl
told
right
enough
well
let
'
s
hope
they
will
be
some
sort
of
use
remarked
nolan
in
a
somewhat
hopeless
manner
gazing
out
into
the
darkness
anything
is
to
the
good
said
morton
that
lets
us
know
anything
about
him
do
we
know
anything
about
him
asked
the
melancholy
irishman
we
know
one
thing
about
him
said
wilson
and
it
is
the
one
thing
that
nobody
ever
knew
before
we
know
where
be
is
are
you
sure
inquired
morton
looking
at
him
sharply
quite
sure
replied
his
assistant
at
this
very
minute
he
is
in
that
tower
over
there
by
the
shore
if
you
go
near
enough
you
will
see
the
candle
burning
in
the
window
as
he
spoke
the
noise
of
a
horn
sounded
on
the
road
outside
and
a
moment
after
they
heard
the
throbbing
of
a
motor
car
brought
to
a
standstill
before
the
door
morton
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
thank
the
lord
that
'
s
the
car
from
dublin
he
said
i
ca
not
do
anything
without
special
authority
not
if
he
were
sitting
on
the
top
of
the
tower
and
putting
out
his
tongue
at
us
but
the
chief
can
do
what
he
thinks
best
he
hurried
out
to
the
entrance
and
was
soon
exchanging
greetings
with
a
big
handsome
man
in
a
fur
coat
who
brought
into
the
dingy
little
station
the
indescribable
glow
of
the
great
cities
and
the
luxuries
of
the
great
world
for
this
was
sir
walter
carey
an
official
of
such
eminence
in
dublin
castle
that
nothing
short
of
the
case
of
prince
michael
would
have
brought
him
on
such
a
journey
in
the
middle
of
the
night
but
the
case
of
prince
michael
as
it
happened
was
complicated
by
legalism
as
well
as
lawlessness
on
the
last
occasion
he
had
escaped
by
a
forensic
quibble
and
not
as
usual
by
a
private
escapade
and
it
was
a
question
whether
at
the
moment
he
was
amenable
to
the
law
or
not
it
might
be
necessary
to
stretch
a
point
but
a
man
like
sir
walter
could
probably
stretch
it
as
far
as
he
liked
whether
he
intended
to
do
so
was
a
question
to
be
considered
despite
the
almost
aggressive
touch
of
luxury
in
the
fur
coat
it
soon
became
apparent
that
sir
walter
'
s
large
leonine
head
was
for
use
as
well
as
ornament
and
he
considered
the
matter
soberly
and
sanely
enough
five
chairs
were
set
round
the
plain
deal
table
for
who
should
sir
walter
bring
with
him
but
his
young
relative
and
secretary
horne
fisher
sir
walter
listened
with
grave
attention
and
his
secretary
with
polite
boredom
to
the
string
of
episodes
by
which
the
police
had
traced
the
flying
rebel
from
the
steps
of
the
hotel
to
the
solitary
tower
beside
the
sea
there
at
least
he
was
cornered
between
the
moors
and
the
breakers
and
the
scout
sent
by
wilson
reported
him
as
writing
under
a
solitary
candle
perhaps
composing
another
of
his
tremendous
proclamations
indeed
it
would
have
been
typical
of
him
to
choose
it
as
the
place
in
which
finally
to
turn
to
bay
he
had
some
remote
claim
on
it
as
on
a
family
castle
and
those
who
knew
him
thought
him
capable
of
imitating
the
primitive
irish
chieftains
who
fell
fighting
against
the
sea
i
saw
some
queer
-
looking
people
leaving
as
i
came
in
said
sir
walter
carey
i
suppose
they
were
your
witnesses
but
why
do
they
turn
up
here
at
this
time
of
night
morton
smiled
grimly
they
come
here
by
night
because
they
would
be
dead
men
if
they
came
here
by
day
they
are
criminals
committing
a
crime
that
is
more
horrible
here
than
theft
or
murder
what
crime
do
you
mean
asked
the
other
with
some
curiosity
they
are
helping
the
law
said
morton
there
was
a
silence
and
sir
walter
considered
the
papers
before
him
with
an
abstracted
eye
at
last
he
spoke
quite
so
but
look
here
if
the
local
feeling
is
as
lively
as
that
there
are
a
good
many
points
to
consider
i
believe
the
new
act
will
enable
me
to
collar
him
now
if
i
think
it
best
but
is
it
best
a
serious
rising
would
do
us
no
good
in
parliament
and
the
government
has
enemies
in
england
as
well
as
ireland
it
wo
not
do
if
i
have
done
what
looks
a
little
like
sharp
practice
and
then
only
raised
a
revolution
it
is
all
the
other
way
said
the
man
called
wilson
rather
quickly
there
wo
not
be
half
so
much
of
a
revolution
if
you
arrest
him
as
there
will
if
you
leave
him
loose
for
three
days
longer
but
anyhow
there
ca
not
be
anything
nowadays
that
the
proper
police
ca
not
manage
mr
wilson
is
a
londoner
said
the
irish
detective
with
a
smile
yes
i
am
a
cockney
all
right
replied
wilson
and
i
think
i
am
all
the
better
for
that
especially
at
this
job
oddly
enough
sir
walter
seemed
slightly
amused
at
the
pertinacity
of
the
third
officer
and
perhaps
even
more
amused
at
the
slight
accent
with
which
he
spoke
which
rendered
rather
needless
his
boast
about
his
origin
do
you
mean
to
say
he
asked
that
you
know
more
about
the
business
here
because
you
have
come
from
london
sounds
funny
i
know
but
i
do
believe
it
answered
wilson
i
believe
these
affairs
want
fresh
methods
but
most
of
all
i
believe
they
want
a
fresh
eye
the
superior
officers
laughed
and
the
redhaired
man
went
on
with
a
slight
touch
of
temper
well
look
at
the
facts
see
how
the
fellow
got
away
every
time
and
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
why
was
he
able
to
stand
in
the
place
of
the
scarecrow
hidden
by
nothing
but
an
old
hat
because
it
was
a
village
policeman
who
knew
the
scarecrow
was
there
was
expecting
it
and
therefore
took
no
notice
of
it
now
i
never
expect
a
scarecrow
i
'
ve
never
seen
one
in
the
street
and
i
stare
at
one
when
i
see
it
in
the
field
it
is
a
new
thing
to
me
and
worth
noticing
and
it
was
just
the
same
when
he
hid
in
the
well
you
are
ready
to
find
a
well
in
a
place
like
that
you
look
for
a
well
and
so
