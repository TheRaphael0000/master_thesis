boldwood
was
tenant
of
what
was
called
little
weatherbury
farm
,
and
his
person
was
the
nearest
approach
to
aristocracy
that
this
remoter
quarter
of
the
parish
could
boast
of
.
genteel
strangers
,
whose
god
was
their
town
,
who
might
happen
to
be
compelled
to
linger
about
this
nook
for
a
day
,
heard
the
sound
of
light
wheels
,
and
prayed
to
see
good
society
,
to
the
degree
of
a
solitary
lord
,
or
squire
at
the
very
least
,
but
it
was
only
mr
boldwood
going
out
for
the
day
.
they
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
yet
once
more
,
and
were
re
-
animated
to
expectancy
:
it
was
only
mr
bold
-
wood
coming
home
again
.
his
house
stood
recessed
from
the
road
,
and
the
stables
,
which
are
to
a
farm
what
a
fireplace
is
to
a
room
,
were
behind
,
their
lower
portions
being
lost
amid
bushes
of
laurel
.
inside
the
blue
door
,
open
half
-
way
down
,
were
to
be
seen
at
this
time
the
backs
and
tails
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
warm
and
contented
horses
standing
in
their
stalls
;
and
as
thus
viewed
,
they
pre
-
sented
alternations
of
roan
and
bay
,
in
shapes
like
a
moorish
arch
,
the
tail
being
a
streak
down
the
midst
of
each
.
over
these
,
and
lost
to
the
eye
gazing
in
from
the
outer
light
,
the
mouths
of
the
same
animals
could
be
heard
busily
sustaining
the
above
-
named
warmth
and
plumpness
by
quantities
of
oats
and
hay
.
the
restless
and
shadowy
figure
of
a
colt
wandered
about
a
loose
-
box
at
the
end
,
whilst
the
steady
grind
of
all
the
eaters
was
occasionally
diversified
by
the
rattle
of
a
rope
or
the
stamp
of
a
foot
.
pacing
up
and
down
at
the
heels
of
the
animals
was
farmer
boldwood
himself
.
this
place
was
his
almonry
and
cloister
in
one
:
here
,
after
looking
to
the
feeding
of
his
four
-
footed
dependants
,
the
celibate
would
walk
and
meditate
of
an
evening
till
the
moon
'
s
rays
streamed
in
through
the
cobwebbed
windows
,
or
total
darkness
enveloped
the
scene
.
his
square
-
framed
perpendicularity
showed
more
fully
now
than
in
the
crowd
and
bustle
of
the
market
-
house
.
in
this
meditative
walk
his
foot
met
the
floor
with
heel
and
toe
simultaneously
,
and
his
fine
reddish
-
fleshed
face
was
bent
downwards
just
enough
to
render
obscure
the
still
mouth
and
the
well
-
rounded
though
rather
prominent
and
broad
chin
.
a
few
clear
and
thread
-
like
horizontal
lines
were
the
only
interruption
to
the
otherwise
smooth
surface
of
his
large
forehead
.
the
phases
of
boldwood
'
s
life
were
ordinary
enough
,
but
his
was
not
an
ordinary
nature
.
that
stillness
,
which
struck
casual
observers
more
than
anything
else
in
his
character
and
habit
,
and
seemed
so
precisely
like
the
rest
of
inanition
,
may
have
been
the
perfect
balance
of
enormous
antagonistic
forces
positives
and
negatives
in
fine
adjustment
.
his
equilibrium
disturbed
,
he
was
in
extremity
at
once
.
if
an
emotion
possessed
him
at
all
,
it
ruled
him
;
a
feeling
not
mastering
him
was
entirely
latent
.
stagnant
or
rapid
,
it
was
never
slow
.
he
was
always
hit
mortally
,
or
he
was
missed
.
he
had
no
light
and
careless
touches
in
his
constitution
,
either
for
good
or
for
evil
.
stern
in
the
outlines
of
action
,
mild
in
the
details
,
he
was
serious
throughout
all
.
he
saw
no
absurd
sides
to
the
follies
of
life
,
and
thus
,
though
not
quite
companionable
in
the
eyes
of
merry
men
and
scoffers
,
and
those
to
whom
all
things
show
life
as
a
jest
,
he
was
not
intolerable
to
the
earnest
and
those
acquainted
with
grief
.
being
a
man
who
read
all
the
dramas
of
life
seriously
,
if
he
failed
to
please
when
they
were
comedies
,
there
was
no
frivolous
treatment
to
reproach
him
for
when
they
chanced
to
end
tragically
.
bathsheba
was
far
from
dreaming
that
the
dark
and
silent
shape
upon
which
she
had
so
carelessly
thrown
a
seed
was
a
hotbed
of
tropic
intensity
.
had
she
known
boldwood
'
s
moods
,
her
blame
would
have
been
fearful
,
and
the
stain
upon
her
heart
ineradicable
.
moreover
,
had
she
known
her
present
power
for
good
or
evil
over
this
man
,
she
would
have
trembled
at
her
responsibility
.
luckily
for
her
present
,
unluckily
for
her
future
tranquillity
,
her
understanding
had
not
yet
told
her
what
boldwood
was
.
nobody
knew
entirely
;
for
though
it
was
possible
to
form
guesses
concerning
his
wild
capabilities
from
old
floodmarks
faintly
visible
,
he
had
never
been
seen
at
the
high
tides
which
caused
them
.
farmer
boldwood
came
to
the
stable
-
door
and
looked
forth
across
the
level
fields
.
beyond
the
first
enclosure
was
a
hedge
,
and
on
the
other
side
of
this
a
meadow
belonging
to
bathsheba
'
s
farm
.
it
was
now
early
spring
the
time
of
going
to
grass
with
the
sheep
,
when
they
have
the
first
feed
of
the
meadows
,
before
these
are
laid
up
for
mowing
.
the
wind
,
which
had
been
blowing
east
for
several
weeks
,
had
veered
to
the
southward
,
and
the
middle
of
spring
had
come
abruptly
almost
without
a
beginning
.
it
was
that
period
in
the
vernal
quarter
when
we
map
suppose
the
dryads
to
be
waking
for
the
season
.
the
vegetable
world
begins
to
move
and
swell
and
the
saps
to
rise
,
till
in
the
completest
silence
of
lone
gardens
and
trackless
plantations
,
where
everything
seems
helpless
and
still
after
the
bond
and
slavery
of
frost
,
there
are
bustlings
,
strainings
,
united
thrusts
,
and
pulls
-
all
-
together
,
in
comparison
with
which
the
powerful
tugs
of
cranes
and
pulleys
in
a
noisy
city
are
but
pigmy
efforts
.
boldwood
,
looking
into
the
distant
meadows
,
saw
there
three
figures
.
they
were
those
of
miss
everdene
,
shepherd
oak
,
and
cainy
ball
.
when
bathsheba
'
s
figure
shone
upon
the
farmer
'
s
eyes
it
lighted
him
up
as
the
moon
lights
up
a
great
tower
.
a
man
'
s
body
is
as
the
shell
;
or
the
tablet
,
of
his
soul
,
as
he
is
reserved
or
ingenuous
,
overflowing
or
self
-
contained
.
there
was
a
change
in
boldwood
'
s
exterior
from
its
former
impassibleness
;
and
his
face
showed
that
he
was
now
living
outside
his
defences
for
the
first
time
,
and
with
a
fearful
sense
of
exposure
.
it
is
the
usual
experience
of
strong
natures
when
they
love
.
at
last
he
arrived
at
a
conclusion
.
it
was
to
go
across
and
inquire
boldly
of
her
.
the
insulation
of
his
heart
by
reserve
during
these
many
years
,
without
a
channel
of
any
kind
for
disposable
emotion
,
had
worked
its
effect
.
it
has
been
observed
more
than
once
that
the
causes
of
love
are
chiefly
subjective
,
and
boldwood
was
a
living
testimony
to
the
truth
of
the
proposition
.
no
mother
existed
to
absorb
his
devotion
,
no
sister
for
his
tenderness
,
no
idle
ties
for
sense
.
he
became
surcharged
with
the
compound
,
which
was
genuine
lover
'
s
love
.
he
approached
the
gate
of
the
meadow
.
beyond
it
the
ground
was
melodious
with
ripples
,
and
the
sky
with
larks
;
the
low
bleating
of
the
flock
mingling
with
both
.
mistress
and
man
were
engaged
in
the
operation
of
making
a
lamb
take
.
which
is
performed
whenever
an
ewe
has
lost
her
own
offspring
,
one
of
the
twins
of
another
ewe
being
given
her
as
a
substitute
.
gabriel
had
skinned
the
dead
lamb
,
and
was
tying
the
skin
over
the
body
of
the
live
lamb
,
in
the
customary
manner
,
whilst
bathsheba
was
holding
open
a
little
pen
of
four
hurdles
,
into
which
the
mother
and
foisted
lamb
were
driven
,
where
they
would
remain
till
the
old
sheep
conceived
an
affection
for
the
young
one
.
bathsheba
looked
up
at
the
completion
of
the
manoeuvre
,
and
saw
the
farmer
by
the
gate
,
where
he
was
overhung
by
a
willow
tree
in
full
bloom
.
gabriel
,
to
whom
her
face
was
as
the
uncertain
glory
of
an
april
day
,
was
ever
regardful
of
its
faintest
changes
,
and
instantly
discerned
thereon
the
mark
of
some
influence
from
without
,
in
the
form
of
a
keenly
self
-
conscious
reddening
.
he
also
turned
and
beheld
boldwood
.
at
once
connecting
these
signs
with
the
letter
boldwood
had
shown
him
,
gabriel
suspected
her
of
some
coquettish
procedure
begun
by
that
means
,
and
carried
on
since
,
he
knew
not
how
.
farmer
boldwood
had
read
the
pantomime
denoting
that
they
were
aware
of
his
presence
,
and
the
perception
was
as
too
much
light
turned
upon
his
new
sensibility
.
he
was
still
in
the
road
,
and
by
moving
on
he
hoped
that
neither
would
recognize
that
he
had
originally
intended
to
enter
the
field
.
he
passed
by
with
an
utter
and
overwhelming
sensation
of
ignorance
,
shyness
,
and
doubt
.
perhaps
in
her
manner
there
were
signs
that
she
wished
to
see
him
perhaps
not
he
could
not
read
a
woman
.
the
cabala
of
this
erotic
philosophy
seemed
to
consist
of
the
subtlest
meanings
expressed
in
misleading
ways
.
every
turn
,
look
,
word
,
and
accent
contained
a
mystery
quite
distinct
from
its
obvious
import
,
and
not
one
had
ever
been
pondered
by
him
until
now
.
as
for
bathsheba
,
she
was
not
deceived
into
the
belief
that
farmer
boldwood
had
walked
by
on
business
or
in
idleness
.
she
collected
the
probabilities
of
the
case
,
and
concluded
that
she
was
herself
responsible
for
boldwood
'
s
appearance
there
.
it
troubled
her
much
to
see
what
a
great
flame
a
little
wildfire
was
likely
to
kindle
.
bathsheba
was
no
schemer
for
marriage
,
nor
was
she
deliberately
a
trifler
with
the
affections
of
men
,
and
a
censor
'
s
experience
on
seeing
an
actual
flirt
after
observing
her
would
have
been
a
feeling
of
surprise
that
bathsheba
could
be
so
different
from
such
a
one
,
and
yet
so
like
what
a
flirt
is
supposed
to
be
.
she
resolved
never
again
,
by
look
or
by
sign
,
to
interrupt
the
steady
flow
of
this
man
'
s
life
.
but
a
resolution
to
avoid
an
evil
is
seldom
framed
till
the
evil
is
so
far
advanced
as
to
make
avoidance
impossible
.
boldwood
did
eventually
call
upon
her
.
she
was
not
at
home
.
of
course
not
.
he
murmured
.
in
contemplating
bathsheba
as
a
woman
,
he
had
forgotten
the
accidents
of
her
position
as
an
agriculturist
that
being
as
much
of
a
farmer
,
and
as
extensive
a
farmer
,
as
himself
,
her
probable
whereabouts
was
out
-
of
-
doors
at
this
time
of
the
year
.
this
,
and
the
other
oversights
boldwood
was
guilty
of
,
were
natural
to
the
mood
,
and
still
more
natural
to
the
circumstances
.
the
great
aids
to
idealization
in
love
were
present
here
:
occasional
observation
of
her
from
a
distance
,
and
the
absence
of
social
intercourse
with
her
visual
familiarity
,
oral
strangeness
.
the
smaller
human
elements
were
kept
out
of
sight
;
the
pettinesses
that
enter
so
largely
into
all
earthly
living
and
doing
were
disguised
by
the
accident
of
lover
and
loved
-
one
not
being
on
visiting
terms
;
and
there
was
hardly
awakened
a
thought
in
boldwood
that
sorry
household
realities
appertained
to
her
,
or
that
she
,
like
all
others
,
had
moments
of
commonplace
,
when
to
be
least
plainly
seen
was
to
be
most
prettily
remembered
.
thus
a
mild
sort
of
apotheosis
took
place
in
his
fancy
,
whilst
she
still
lived
and
breathed
within
his
own
horizon
,
a
troubled
creature
like
himself
.
it
was
the
end
of
may
when
the
farmer
determined
to
be
no
longer
repulsed
by
trivialities
or
distracted
by
suspense
.
he
had
by
this
time
grown
used
to
being
in
love
;
the
passion
now
startled
him
less
even
when
it
tortured
him
more
,
and
he
felt
himself
adequate
to
the
situation
.
on
inquiring
for
her
at
her
house
they
had
told
him
she
was
at
the
sheep
-
washing
,
and
he
went
off
to
seek
her
there
.
the
sheep
-
washing
pool
was
a
perfectly
circular
basin
of
brickwork
in
the
meadows
,
full
of
the
clearest
water
.
to
birds
on
the
wing
its
glassy
surface
,
reflecting
the
light
sky
,
must
have
been
visible
for
miles
around
as
a
glistening
cyclops
'
eye
in
a
green
face
.
the
grass
about
the
margin
at
this
season
was
a
sight
to
remember
long
in
a
minor
sort
of
way
.
its
activity
in
sucking
the
moisture
from
the
rich
damp
sod
.
was
almost
a
process
observable
by
the
eye
.
the
outskirts
of
this
level
water
-
meadow
were
diversified
by
rounded
and
hollow
pastures
,
where
just
now
every
flower
that
was
not
a
buttercup
was
a
daisy
.
the
river
slid
along
noiselessly
as
a
shade
,
the
swelling
reeds
and
sedge
forming
a
flexible
palisade
upon
its
moist
brink
.
to
the
north
of
the
mead
were
trees
,
the
leaves
of
which
were
new
,
soft
,
and
moist
,
not
yet
having
stiffened
and
darkened
under
summer
sun
and
drought
,
their
colour
being
yellow
beside
a
green
green
beside
a
yellow
.
from
the
recesses
of
this
knot
of
foliage
the
loud
notes
of
three
cuckoos
were
resounding
through
the
still
air
.
boldwood
went
meditating
down
the
slopes
with
his
eyes
on
his
boots
,
which
the
yellow
pollen
from
the
buttercups
had
bronzed
in
artistic
gradations
.
a
tributary
of
the
main
stream
flowed
through
the
basin
of
the
pool
by
an
inlet
and
outlet
at
opposite
points
of
its
diameter
.
shepherd
oak
,
jan
coggan
,
moon
,
poor
-
grass
,
cain
ball
,
and
several
others
were
assembled
here
,
all
dripping
wet
to
the
very
roots
of
their
hair
,
and
bathsheba
was
standing
by
in
a
new
riding
-
habit
the
most
elegant
she
had
ever
worn
the
reins
of
her
horse
being
looped
over
her
arm
.
flagons
of
cider
were
rolling
about
upon
the
green
.
the
meek
sheep
were
pushed
into
the
pool
by
coggan
and
matthew
moon
,
who
stood
by
the
lower
hatch
,
immersed
to
their
waists
;
then
gabriel
,
who
stood
on
the
brink
,
thrust
them
under
as
they
swam
along
,
with
an
instrument
like
a
crutch
,
formed
for
the
purpose
,
and
also
for
assisting
the
exhausted
animals
when
the
wool
became
saturated
and
they
began
to
sink
.
they
were
let
out
against
the
stream
,
and
through
the
upper
opening
,
all
impurities
flowing
away
below
.
cainy
ball
and
joseph
,
who
performed
this
latter
operation
,
were
if
possible
wetter
than
the
rest
;
they
resembled
dolphins
under
a
fountain
,
every
protuberance
and
angle
of
their
clothes
dribbling
forth
a
small
rill
.
boldwood
came
close
and
bade
her
good
-
morning
,
with
such
constraint
that
she
could
not
but
think
he
had
stepped
across
to
the
washing
for
its
own
sake
,
hoping
not
to
find
her
there
;
more
,
she
fancied
his
brow
severe
and
his
eye
slighting
.
bathsheba
immediately
contrived
to
withdraw
,
and
glided
along
by
the
river
till
she
was
a
stone
'
s
throw
off
.
she
heard
footsteps
brushing
the
grass
,
and
had
a
consciousness
that
love
was
encircling
her
like
a
perfume
.
instead
of
turning
or
waiting
,
bathsheba
went
further
among
the
high
sedges
,
but
boldwood
seemed
determined
,
and
pressed
on
till
they
were
completely
past
the
bend
of
the
river
.
here
,
without
being
seen
,
they
could
hear
the
splashing
and
shouts
of
the
washers
above
.
miss
everdene
!
said
the
farmer
.
she
trembled
,
turned
,
and
said
good
morning
.
his
tone
was
so
utterly
removed
from
all
she
had
expected
as
a
beginning
.
it
was
lowness
and
quiet
accentuated
:
an
emphasis
of
deep
meanings
,
their
form
,
at
the
same
time
,
being
scarcely
expressed
.
silence
has
sometimes
a
remarkable
power
of
showing
itself
as
the
disembodied
soul
of
feeling
wandering
without
its
carcase
,
and
it
is
then
more
impressive
than
speech
.
in
the
same
way
,
to
say
a
little
is
often
to
tell
more
than
to
say
a
great
deal
.
boldwood
told
everything
in
that
word
.
as
the
consciousness
expands
on
learning
that
what
was
fancied
to
be
the
rumble
of
wheels
is
the
reverberation
of
thunder
,
so
did
bathsheba
'
s
at
her
intuitive
conviction
.
i
feel
almost
too
much
to
think
.
he
said
,
with
a
solemn
simplicity
.
i
have
come
to
speak
to
you
without
preface
.
my
life
is
not
my
own
since
i
have
beheld
you
clearly
,
miss
everdene
i
come
to
make
you
an
offer
of
marriage
.
bathsheba
tried
to
preserve
an
absolutely
neutral
countenance
,
and
all
the
motion
she
made
was
that
of
closing
lips
which
had
previously
been
a
little
parted
.
i
am
now
forty
-
one
years
old
.
he
went
on
.
i
may
have
been
called
a
confirmed
bachelor
,
and
i
was
a
confirmed
bachelor
.
i
had
never
any
views
of
myself
as
a
husband
in
my
earlier
days
,
nor
have
i
made
any
calculation
on
the
subject
since
i
have
been
older
.
but
we
all
change
,
and
my
change
,
in
this
matter
,
came
with
seeing
you
.
i
have
felt
lately
,
more
and
more
,
that
my
present
way
of
living
is
bad
in
every
respect
.
beyond
all
things
,
i
want
you
as
my
wife
.
i
feel
,
mr
boldwood
,
that
though
i
respect
you
much
,
i
do
not
feel
what
would
justify
me
to
in
accepting
your
offer
.
she
stammered
.
this
giving
back
of
dignity
for
dignity
seemed
to
open
the
sluices
of
feeling
that
boldwood
had
as
yet
kept
closed
.
my
life
is
a
burden
without
you
.
he
exclaimed
,
in
a
low
voice
.
i
want
you
i
want
you
to
let
me
say
i
love
you
again
and
again
!
bathsheba
answered
nothing
,
and
the
mare
upon
her
arm
seemed
so
impressed
that
instead
of
cropping
the
herbage
she
looked
up
.
i
think
and
hope
you
care
enough
for
me
to
listen
to
what
i
have
to
tell
!
bathsheba
'
s
momentary
impulse
at
hearing
this
was
to
ask
why
he
thought
that
,
till
she
remembered
that
,
far
from
being
a
conceited
assumption
on
boldwood
'
s
part
,
it
was
but
the
natural
conclusion
of
serious
reflection
based
on
deceptive
premises
of
her
own
offering
.
i
wish
i
could
say
courteous
flatteries
to
you
.
the
farmer
continued
in
an
easier
tone
,
and
put
my
rugged
feeling
into
a
graceful
shape
:
but
i
have
neither
power
nor
patience
to
learn
such
things
.
i
want
you
for
my
wife
so
wildly
that
no
other
feeling
can
abide
in
me
;
but
i
should
not
have
spoken
out
had
i
not
been
led
to
hope
.
the
valentine
again
!
o
that
valentine
!
she
said
to
herself
,
but
not
a
word
to
him
.
if
you
can
love
me
say
so
,
miss
everdene
.
if
not
do
not
say
no
!
mr
boldwood
,
it
is
painful
to
have
to
say
i
am
surprised
,
so
that
i
do
not
know
how
to
answer
you
with
propriety
and
respect
but
am
only
just
able
to
speak
out
my
feeling
i
mean
my
meaning
;
that
i
am
afraid
i
ca
not
marry
you
,
much
as
i
respect
you
.
you
are
too
dignified
for
me
to
suit
you
,
sir
.
but
,
miss
everdene
!
i
i
did
not
i
know
i
ought
never
to
have
dreamt
of
sending
that
valentine
forgive
me
,
sir
it
was
a
wanton
thing
which
no
woman
with
any
self
-
respect
should
have
done
.
if
you
will
only
pardon
my
thoughtlessness
,
i
promise
never
to
no
,
no
,
no
.
do
not
say
thoughtlessness
!
make
me
think
it
was
something
more
that
it
was
a
sort
of
prophetic
instinct
the
beginning
of
a
feeling
that
you
would
like
me
.
you
torture
me
to
say
it
was
done
in
thoughtlessness
i
never
thought
of
it
in
that
light
,
and
i
ca
not
endure
it
.
ah
!
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
win
you
!
but
that
i
ca
not
do
i
can
only
ask
if
i
have
already
got
you
.
if
i
have
not
,
and
it
is
not
true
that
you
have
come
unwittingly
to
me
as
i
have
to
you
,
i
can
say
no
more
.
i
have
not
fallen
in
love
with
you
,
mr
boldwood
certainly
i
must
say
that
.
she
allowed
a
very
small
smile
to
creep
for
the
first
time
over
her
serious
face
in
saying
this
,
and
the
white
row
of
upper
teeth
,
and
keenly
-
cut
lips
already
noticed
,
suggested
an
idea
of
heartlessness
,
which
was
immediately
contradicted
by
the
pleasant
eyes
.
but
you
will
just
think
in
kindness
and
condescension
think
if
you
cannot
bear
with
me
as
a
husband
!
i
fear
i
am
too
old
for
you
,
but
believe
me
i
will
take
more
care
of
you
than
would
many
a
man
of
your
own
age
.
i
will
protect
and
cherish
you
with
all
my
strength
i
will
indeed
!
you
shall
have
no
cares
be
worried
by
no
household
affairs
,
and
live
quite
at
ease
,
miss
everdene
.
the
dairy
superintendence
shall
be
done
by
a
man
i
can
afford
it
will
you
shall
never
have
so
much
as
to
look
out
of
doors
at
haymaking
time
,
or
to
think
of
weather
in
the
harvest
.
i
rather
cling
;
to
the
chaise
,
because
it
is
he
same
my
poor
father
and
mother
drove
,
but
if
you
do
not
like
it
i
will
sell
it
,
and
you
shall
have
a
pony
-
carriage
of
your
own
.
i
cannot
say
how
far
above
every
other
idea
and
object
on
earth
you
seem
to
me
nobody
knows
god
only
knows
how
much
you
are
to
me
!
bathsheba
'
s
heart
was
young
,
and
it
swelled
with
sympathy
for
the
deep
-
natured
man
who
spoke
so
simply
.
do
not
say
it
!
don
'
t
!
i
cannot
bear
you
to
feel
so
much
,
and
me
to
feel
nothing
.
and
i
am
afraid
they
will
notice
us
,
mr
boldwood
.
will
you
let
the
matter
rest
now
?
i
cannot
think
collectedly
.
i
did
not
know
you
were
going
to
say
this
to
me
.
o
,
i
am
wicked
to
have
made
you
suffer
so
!
she
was
frightened
as
well
as
agitated
at
his
vehemence
.
say
then
,
that
you
do
not
absolutely
refuse
.
do
not
quite
refuse
?
i
can
do
nothing
.
i
cannot
answer
.
i
may
speak
to
you
again
on
the
subject
?
yes
.
i
may
think
of
you
?
yes
,
i
suppose
you
may
think
of
me
.
and
hope
to
obtain
you
?
no
do
not
hope
!
let
us
go
on
.
i
will
call
upon
you
again
to
-
morrow
.
no
please
not
.
give
me
time
.
yes
i
will
give
you
any
time
.
he
said
earnestly
and
gratefully
.
i
am
happier
now
.
no
i
beg
you
!
do
not
be
happier
if
happiness
only
comes
from
my
agreeing
.
be
neutral
,
mr
bold
-
wood
!
i
must
think
.
i
will
wait
.
he
said
.
and
then
she
turned
away
.
boldwood
dropped
his
gaze
to
the
ground
,
and
stood
long
like
a
man
who
did
not
know
where
he
was
.
realities
then
returned
upon
him
like
the
pain
of
a
wound
received
in
an
excitement
which
eclipses
it
,
and
he
,
too
,
then
went
on
.
he
is
so
disinterested
and
kind
to
offer
me
all
that
i
can
desire
.
bathsheba
mused
.
yet
farmer
boldwood
,
whether
by
nature
kind
or
the
reverse
to
kind
,
did
not
exercise
kindness
,
here
.
the
rarest
offerings
of
the
purest
loves
are
but
a
self
-
indulgence
,
and
no
generosity
at
all
.
bathsheba
,
not
being
the
least
in
love
with
him
,
was
eventually
able
to
look
calmly
at
his
offer
.
it
was
one
which
many
women
of
her
own
station
in
the
neighbour
-
hood
,
and
not
a
few
of
higher
rank
,
would
have
been
wild
to
accept
and
proud
to
publish
.
in
every
point
of
view
,
ranging
from
politic
to
passionate
,
it
was
desirable
that
she
,
a
lonely
girl
,
should
marry
,
and
marry
this
earnest
,
well
-
to
-
do
,
and
respected
man
.
he
was
close
to
her
doors
:
his
standing
was
sufficient
:
his
qualities
were
even
supererogatory
.
had
she
felt
,
which
she
did
not
,
any
wish
whatever
for
the
married
state
in
the
abstract
,
she
could
not
reasonably
have
rejected
him
,
being
a
woman
who
frequently
appealed
to
her
under
,
standing
for
deliverance
from
her
whims
.
boldwood
as
a
means
to
marriage
was
unexceptionable
:
she
esteemed
and
liked
him
,
yet
she
did
not
want
him
.
it
appears
that
ordinary
men
take
wives
because
possession
is
not
possible
without
marriage
,
and
that
ordinary
women
accept
husbands
because
marriage
is
not
possible
with
,
out
possession
;
with
totally
differing
aims
the
method
is
the
same
on
both
sides
.
but
the
understood
incentive
on
the
woman
'
s
part
was
wanting
here
.
besides
,
bathsheba
'
s
position
as
absolute
mistress
of
a
farm
and
house
was
a
novel
one
,
and
the
novelty
had
not
yet
begun
to
wear
off
.
but
a
disquiet
filled
her
which
was
somewhat
to
her
credit
,
for
it
would
have
affected
few
.
beyond
the
mentioned
reasons
with
which
she
combated
her
objections
,
she
had
a
strong
feeling
that
,
having
been
the
one
who
began
the
game
,
she
ought
in
honesty
to
accept
the
consequences
.
still
the
reluctance
remained
.
she
said
in
the
same
breath
that
it
would
be
ungenerous
not
to
marry
boldwood
,
and
that
she
could
not
do
it
to
save
her
life
.
bathsheba
'
s
was
an
impulsive
nature
under
a
deliberative
aspect
.
an
elizabeth
in
brain
and
a
mary
stuart
in
spirit
,
she
often
performed
actions
of
the
greatest
temerity
with
a
manner
of
extreme
discretion
.
many
of
her
thoughts
were
perfect
syllogisms
;
unluckily
they
always
remained
thoughts
.
only
a
few
were
irrational
assumptions
;
but
,
unfortunately
,
they
were
the
ones
which
most
frequently
grew
into
deeds
.
the
next
day
to
that
of
the
declaration
she
found
gabriel
oak
at
the
bottom
of
her
garden
,
grinding
his
shears
for
the
sheep
-
shearing
.
all
the
surrounding
cottages
were
more
or
less
scenes
of
the
same
operation
;
the
scurr
of
whetting
spread
into
the
sky
from
all
parts
of
the
village
as
from
an
armury
previous
to
a
campaign
.
peace
and
war
kiss
each
other
at
their
hours
of
preparation
sickles
,
scythes
,
shears
,
and
pruning
-
hooks
,
ranking
with
swords
,
bayonets
,
and
lances
,
in
their
common
necessity
for
point
and
edge
.
cainy
ball
turned
the
handle
of
gabriel
'
s
grindstone
,
his
head
performing
a
melancholy
see
-
saw
up
and
down
with
each
turn
of
the
wheel
.
oak
stood
somewhat
as
eros
is
represented
when
in
the
act
of
sharpening
his
arrows
:
his
figure
slightly
bent
,
the
weight
of
his
body
thrown
over
on
the
shears
,
and
his
head
balanced
side
-
ways
,
with
a
critical
compression
of
the
lips
and
contraction
of
the
eyelids
to
crown
the
attitude
.
his
mistress
came
up
and
looked
upon
them
in
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
;
then
she
said
cain
,
go
to
the
lower
mead
and
catch
the
bay
mare
.
i
will
turn
the
winch
of
the
grindstone
.
i
want
to
speak
to
you
,
gabriel
.
cain
departed
,
and
bathsheba
took
the
handle
.
gabriel
had
glanced
up
in
intense
surprise
,
quelled
its
expression
,
and
looked
down
again
.
bathsheba
turned
the
winch
,
and
gabriel
applied
the
shears
.
the
peculiar
motion
involved
in
turning
a
wheel
has
a
wonderful
tendency
to
benumb
the
mind
.
it
is
a
sort
of
attenuated
variety
of
ixion
'
s
punishment
,
and
contributes
a
dismal
chapter
to
the
history
of
heavy
,
and
the
body
'
s
centre
of
gravity
seems
to
settle
by
degrees
in
a
leaden
lump
somewhere
between
the
eyebrows
and
the
crown
.
bathsheba
felt
the
unpleasant
symptoms
after
two
or
three
dozen
turns
.
will
you
turn
,
gabriel
,
and
let
me
hold
the
shears
?
she
said
.
my
head
is
in
a
'
whirl
,
and
i
ca
not
talk
.
gabriel
turned
.
bathsheba
then
began
,
with
some
awkwardness
,
allowing
her
thoughts
to
stray
occasionally
from
her
story
to
attend
to
the
shears
,
which
required
a
little
nicety
in
sharpening
.
i
wanted
to
ask
you
if
the
men
made
any
observations
on
my
going
behind
the
sedge
with
mr
boldwood
yesterday
?
yes
,
they
did
.
said
gabriel
.
you
do
not
hold
the
shears
right
,
miss
i
knew
you
would
not
know
the
way
hold
like
this
.
he
relinquished
the
winch
,
and
inclosing
her
two
hands
completely
in
his
own
(
taking
each
as
we
some
-
times
slap
a
child
'
s
hand
in
teaching
him
to
write
)
,
grasped
the
shears
with
her
.
incline
the
edge
so
,
he
said
.
hands
and
shears
were
inclined
to
suit
the
words
,
and
held
thus
for
a
peculiarly
long
time
by
the
instructor
as
he
spoke
.
that
will
do
.
exclaimed
bathsheba
.
loose
my
hands
.
i
wo
not
have
them
held
!
turn
the
winch
.
gabriel
freed
her
hands
quietly
,
retired
to
his
handle
,
and
the
grinding
went
on
.
did
the
men
think
it
odd
?
she
said
again
.
odd
was
not
the
idea
,
miss
.
what
did
they
say
?
that
farmer
boldwood
'
s
name
and
your
own
were
likely
to
be
flung
over
pulpit
together
before
the
year
was
out
.
i
thought
so
by
the
look
of
them
!
why
,
there
'
s
nothing
in
it
.
a
more
foolish
remark
was
never
made
,
and
i
want
you
to
contradict
it
!
that
'
s
what
i
came
for
.
gabriel
looked
incredulous
and
sad
,
but
between
his
moments
of
incredulity
,
relieved
.
they
must
have
heard
our
conversation
.
she
continued
.
well
,
then
,
bathsheba
!
said
oak
,
stopping
the
handle
,
and
gazing
into
her
face
with
astonishment
.
miss
everdene
,
you
mean
,
she
said
,
with
dignity
.
i
mean
this
,
that
if
mr
boldwood
really
spoke
of
marriage
,
i
bai
not
going
to
tell
a
story
and
say
he
did
not
to
please
you
.
i
have
already
tried
to
please
you
too
much
for
my
own
good
!
bathsheba
regarded
him
with
round
-
eyed
perplexity
.
she
did
not
know
whether
to
pity
him
for
disappointed
love
of
her
,
or
to
be
angry
with
him
for
having
got
over
it
his
tone
being
ambiguous
.
i
said
i
wanted
you
just
to
mention
that
it
was
not
true
i
was
going
to
be
married
to
him
.
she
mur
-
mured
,
with
a
slight
decline
in
her
assurance
.
i
can
say
that
to
them
if
you
wish
,
miss
everdene
.
and
i
could
likewise
give
an
opinion
to
'
ee
on
what
you
have
done
.
i
daresay
.
but
i
do
not
want
your
opinion
.
i
suppose
not
.
said
gabriel
bitterly
,
and
going
on
with
his
turning
,
his
words
rising
and
falling
in
a
regular
swell
and
cadence
as
he
stooped
or
rose
with
the
winch
,
which
directed
them
,
according
to
his
position
,
perpendicularly
into
the
earth
,
or
horizontally
along
the
garden
,
his
eyes
being
fixed
on
a
leaf
upon
the
ground
.
with
bathsheba
a
hastened
act
was
a
rash
act
;
but
,
as
does
not
always
happen
,
time
gained
was
prudence
insured
.
it
must
be
added
,
however
,
that
time
was
very
seldom
gained
.
at
this
period
the
single
opinion
in
the
parish
on
herself
and
her
doings
that
she
valued
as
sounder
than
her
own
was
gabriel
oak
'
s
.
and
the
outspoken
honesty
of
his
character
was
such
-
that
on
any
subject
even
that
of
her
love
for
,
or
marriage
with
,
another
man
,
the
same
disinterestedness
of
opinion
might
be
calculated
on
,
and
be
had
for
the
asking
.
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
impossibility
of
his
own
suit
,
a
high
resolve
constrained
him
not
to
injure
that
of
another
.
this
is
a
lover
'
s
most
stoical
virtue
,
as
the
lack
of
it
is
a
lover
'
s
most
venial
sin
.
knowing
he
would
reply
truly
,
she
asked
the
question
,
painful
as
she
must
have
known
the
subject
would
be
.
such
is
the
selfishness
of
some
charm
-
ing
women
.
perhaps
it
was
some
excuse
for
her
thus
torturing
honesty
to
her
own
advantage
,
that
she
had
absolutely
no
other
sound
judgment
within
easy
reach
.
well
,
what
is
your
opinion
of
my
conduct
.
she
said
,
quietly
.
that
it
is
unworthy
of
any
thoughtful
,
and
meek
,
and
comely
woman
.
in
an
instant
bathsheba
'
s
face
coloured
with
the
angry
crimson
of
a
danby
sunset
.
but
she
forbore
to
utter
this
feeling
,
and
the
reticence
of
her
tongue
only
made
the
loquacity
of
her
face
the
more
notice
-
able
.
the
next
thing
gabriel
did
was
to
make
a
mistake
.
perhaps
you
do
not
like
the
rudeness
of
my
reprimanding
you
,
for
i
know
it
is
rudeness
;
but
i
thought
it
would
do
good
.
she
instantly
replied
sarcastically
on
the
contrary
,
my
opinion
of
you
is
so
low
,
that
i
see
in
your
abuse
the
praise
of
discerning
people
!
i
am
glad
you
do
not
mind
it
,
for
i
said
it
honestly
and
with
every
serious
meaning
.
i
see
.
but
,
unfortunately
,
when
you
try
not
to
speak
in
jest
you
are
amusing
just
as
when
you
wish
to
avoid
seriousness
you
sometimes
say
a
sensible
word
it
was
a
hard
hit
,
but
bathsheba
had
unmistakably
lost
her
temper
,
and
on
that
account
gabriel
had
never
in
his
life
kept
his
own
better
.
he
said
nothing
.
she
then
broke
out
i
may
ask
,
i
suppose
,
where
in
particular
my
unworthiness
lies
?
in
my
not
marrying
you
,
perhaps
!
not
by
any
means
.
said
gabriel
quietly
.
i
have
long
given
up
thinking
of
that
matter
.
or
wishing
it
,
i
suppose
.
she
said
;
and
it
was
apparent
that
she
expected
an
unhesitating
denial
of
this
supposition
.
whatever
gabriel
felt
,
he
coolly
echoed
her
words
or
wishing
it
either
.
a
woman
may
be
treated
with
a
bitterness
which
is
sweet
to
her
,
and
with
a
rudeness
which
is
not
offensive
.
bathsheba
would
have
submitted
to
an
indignant
chastisement
for
her
levity
had
gabriel
pro
-
tested
that
he
was
loving
her
at
the
same
time
;
the
impetuosity
of
passion
unrequited
is
bearable
,
even
if
it
stings
and
anathematizes
there
is
a
triumph
in
the
humiliation
,
and
a
tenderness
in
the
strife
.
this
was
what
she
had
been
expecting
,
and
what
she
had
not
got
.
to
be
lectured
because
the
lecturer
saw
her
in
the
cold
morning
light
of
open
-
shuttered
disillusion
was
exasperating
.
he
had
not
finished
,
either
.
he
continued
in
a
more
agitated
voice
:
my
opinion
is
(
since
you
ask
it
)
that
you
are
greatly
to
blame
for
playing
pranks
upon
a
man
like
mr
boldwood
,
merely
as
a
pastime
.
leading
on
a
man
you
do
not
care
for
is
not
a
praiseworthy
action
.
and
even
,
miss
everdene
,
if
you
seriously
inclined
towards
him
,
you
might
have
let
him
find
it
out
in
some
way
of
true
loving
-
kindness
,
and
not
by
sending
him
a
valentine
'
s
letter
.
bathsheba
laid
down
the
shears
.
i
cannot
allow
any
man
to
to
criticise
my
private
conduct
!
she
exclaimed
.
nor
will
i
for
a
minute
.
so
you
will
please
leave
the
farm
at
the
end
of
the
week
!
it
may
have
been
a
peculiarity
at
any
rate
it
was
a
fact
that
when
bathsheba
was
swayed
by
an
emotion
of
an
earthly
sort
her
lower
lip
trembled
:
when
by
a
refined
emotion
,
her
upper
or
heavenward
one
.
her
nether
lip
quivered
now
.
very
well
,
so
i
will
.
said
gabriel
calmly
.
he
had
been
held
to
her
by
a
beautiful
thread
which
it
pained
him
to
spoil
by
breaking
,
rather
than
by
a
chain
he
could
not
break
.
i
should
be
even
better
pleased
to
go
at
once
.
he
added
.
go
at
once
then
,
in
heaven
'
s
name
!
said
she
her
eyes
flashing
at
his
,
though
never
meeting
them
.
do
not
let
me
see
your
face
any
more
.
very
well
,
miss
everdene
so
it
shall
be
.
and
he
took
his
shears
and
went
away
from
her
in
placid
dignity
,
as
moses
left
the
presence
of
pharaoh
.
gabriel
oak
had
ceased
to
feed
the
weatherbury
flock
for
about
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
,
when
on
sunday
afternoon
the
elderly
gentlemen
joseph
poorgrass
,
matthew
moon
,
fray
,
and
half
-
a
-
dozen
others
,
came
running
up
to
the
house
of
the
mistress
of
the
upper
farm
.
whatever
is
the
matter
,
men
?
she
said
,
meeting
them
at
the
door
just
as
she
was
coming
out
on
her
way
to
church
,
and
ceasing
in
a
moment
from
the
close
compression
of
her
two
red
lips
,
with
which
she
had
accompanied
the
exertion
of
pulling
on
a
tight
glove
.
sixty

said
joseph
poorgrass
.
seventy

said

.
and
got
into
a
field
of
young
clover
.

tall
.

clover
!

said
joseph

blasted

that
they

said
joseph
.
and
will
all
die
as
dead
as
nits
,
if
they
bai
not
got
out
and
cured
!
said
tall
.
joseph
'
s
countenance
was
drawn
into
lines
and
puckers
by
his
concern
.
fray
'
s
forehead
was
wrinkled
both
perpendicularly
and
crosswise
,
after
the
pattern
of
a
portcullis
,
expressive
of
a
double
despair
.
laban
tall
'
s
lips
were
thin
,
and
his
face
were
rigid
.
matthew
'
s
jaws
sank
,
and
his
eyes
turned
whichever
way
the
strongest
muscle
happened
to
pull
them
.
yes
.
said
joseph
,
and
i
was
sitting
at
home
,
looking
for
ephesians
,
and
says
i
to
myself
,
'
tis
nothing
but
corinthians
and
thessalonians
in
this
danged
testament
.
when
who
should
come
in
but
henery
there
:
joseph
,
he
said
,
the
sheep
have
with
bathsheba
it
was
a
moment
when
thought
was
blasted
theirselves
with
bathsheba
it
was
a
moment
when
thought
was
speech
and
speech
exclamation
.
moreover
,
she
had
hardly
recovered
her
equanimity
since
the
disturbance
which
she
had
suffered
from
oak
'
s
remarks
.
that
'
s
enought
that
'
s
enough
!
oh
,
you
fools
!
she
cried
,
throwing
the
parasol
and
prayer
-
book
into
the
passage
,
and
running
out
of
doors
in
the
direction
signified
.
to
come
to
me
,
and
not
go
and
get
them
out
directly
!
oh
,
the
stupid
numskulls
!
her
eyes
were
at
their
darkest
and
brightest
now
.
bathsheba
'
s
beauty
belonged
rather
to
the
demonian
than
to
the
angelic
school
,
she
never
looked
so
well
as
when
she
was
angry
and
particularly
when
the
effect
was
heightened
by
a
rather
dashing
velvet
dress
,
care
-
fully
put
on
before
a
glass
.
all
the
ancient
men
ran
in
a
jumbled
throng
after
her
to
the
clover
-
field
,
joseph
sinking
down
in
the
midst
when
about
half
-
way
,
like
an
individual
withering
in
a
world
which
was
more
and
more
insupportable
.
having
once
received
the
stimulus
that
her
presence
always
gave
them
they
went
round
among
the
sheep
with
a
will
.
the
majority
of
the
afflicted
animals
were
lying
down
,
and
could
not
be
stirred
.
these
were
bodily
lifted
out
,
and
the
others
driven
into
the
adjoining
field
.
here
,
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
,
several
more
fell
down
,
and
lay
helpless
and
livid
as
the
rest
.
bathsheba
,
with
a
sad
,
bursting
heart
,
looked
at
these
primest
specimens
of
her
prime
flock
as
they
rolled
there
swoln
with
wind
and
the
rank
mist
they
drew
.
many
of
them
foamed
at
the
mouth
,
their
breathing
being
quick
and
short
,
whilst
the
bodies
of
all
were
fearfully
distended
.
o
,
what
can
i
do
,
what
can
i
do
!
said
bathsheba
,
helplessly
.
sheep
are
such
unfortunate
animals
!
there
'
s
always
something
happening
to
them
!
i
never
knew
a
flock
pass
a
year
without
getting
into
some
scrape
or
other
.
there
'
s
only
one
way
of
saving
them
.
said
tall
.
what
way
?
tell
me
quick
!
they
must
be
pierced
in
the
side
with
a
thing
made
on
purpose
.
can
you
do
it
?
can
i
?
no
,
ma
'
am
.
we
can
'
t
,
nor
you
neither
.
it
must
be
done
in
a
particular
spot
.
if
ye
go
to
the
right
or
left
but
an
inch
you
stab
the
ewe
and
kill
her
.
not
even
a
shepherd
can
do
it
,
as
a
rule
.
then
they
must
die
.
she
said
,
in
a
resigned
tone
.
only
one
man
in
the
neighbourhood
knows
the
way
,
said
joseph
,
now
just
come
up
.
he
could
cure
'
em
all
if
he
were
here
.
who
is
he
?
let
'
s
get
him
!
shepherd
oak
,
said
matthew
.
ah
,
he
is
a
clever
man
in
talents
!
ah
,
that
he
is
so
!
said
joseph
poorgrass
.
true
he
is
the
man
.
said
laban
tall
.
how
dare
you
name
that
man
in
my
presence
!
she
said
excitedly
.
i
told
you
never
to
allude
to
him
,
nor
shall
you
if
you
stay
with
me
.
ah
!
she
added
,
brightening
,
farmer
boldwood
knows
!
o
no
,
ma
'
am
said
matthew
.
two
of
his
store
ewes
got
into
some
vetches
t
'
other
day
,
and
were
just
like
these
.
he
sent
a
man
on
horseback
here
post
-
haste
for
gable
,
and
gable
went
and
saved
'
em
,
farmer
boldwood
hev
got
the
thing
they
do
it
with
.
'
tis
a
holler
pipe
,
with
a
sharp
pricker
inside
.
is
not
it
,
joseph
?
ay
a
holler
pipe
.
echoed
joseph
.
that
'
s
what
'
tis
.
ay
,
sure
that
'
s
the
machine
.
chimed
in
henery
fray
,
reflectively
,
with
an
oriental
indifference
to
the
flight
of
time
.
well
,
burst
out
bathsheba
,
do
not
stand
there
with
your
ayes
and
your
sures
talking
at
me
!
get
somebody
to
cure
the
sheep
instantly
!
all
then
stalked
or
in
consternation
,
to
get
somebody
as
directed
,
without
any
idea
of
who
it
was
to
be
.
in
a
minute
they
had
vanished
through
the
gate
,
and
she
stood
alone
with
the
dying
flock
.
never
will
i
send
for
him
never
!
she
said
firmly
.
one
of
the
ewes
here
contracted
its
muscles
horribly
,
extended
itself
,
and
jumped
high
into
the
air
.
the
leap
was
an
astonishing
one
.
the
ewe
fell
heavily
,
and
lay
still
.
bathsheba
went
up
to
it
.
the
sheep
was
dead
.
o
,
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
!
she
again
exclaimed
,
wringing
her
hands
.
i
wo
not
send
for
him
.
no
,
i
won
'
t
!
the
most
vigorous
expression
of
a
resolution
does
not
always
coincide
with
the
greatest
vigour
of
the
resolution
itself
.
it
is
often
flung
out
as
a
sort
of
prop
to
support
a
decaying
conviction
which
,
whilst
strong
,
required
no
enunciation
to
prove
it
so
.
the
no
,
i
wo
not
of
bathsheba
meant
virtually
,
i
think
i
must
.
she
followed
her
assistants
through
the
gate
,
and
lifted
her
hand
to
one
of
them
.
laban
answered
to
her
signal
.
where
is
oak
staying
?
across
the
valley
at
nest
cottage
!
jump
on
the
bay
mare
,
and
ride
across
,
and
say
he
must
return
instantly
that
i
say
so
.
tall
scrambled
off
to
the
field
,
and
in
two
minutes
was
on
poll
,
the
bay
,
bare
-
backed
,
and
with
only
a
halter
by
way
of
rein
.
he
diminished
down
the
hill
.
bathsheba
watched
.
so
did
all
the
rest
.
tall
cantered
along
the
bridle
-
path
through
sixteen
acres
,
sheeplands
,
middle
field
the
flats
,
cappel
'
s
piece
,
shrank
almost
to
a
point
,
crossed
the
bridge
,
and
ascended
from
the
valley
through
springmead
and
whitepits
on
the
other
side
.
the
cottage
to
which
gabriel
had
retired
before
taking
his
final
departure
from
the
locality
was
visible
as
a
white
spot
on
the
opposite
hill
,
backed
by
blue
firs
.
bathsheba
walked
up
and
down
.
the
men
entered
the
field
and
endeavoured
to
ease
the
anguish
of
the
dumb
creatures
by
rubbing
them
.
nothing
availed
.
bathsheba
continued
walking
.
the
horse
was
seen
descending
the
hill
,
and
the
wearisome
series
had
to
be
repeated
in
reverse
order
:
whitepits
,
springmead
,
cappel
'
s
piece
,
the
flats
,
middle
field
,
sheeplands
,
sixteen
acres
.
she
hoped
tall
had
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
give
the
mare
up
to
gabriel
,
and
return
himself
on
foot
.
the
rider
neared
them
.
it
was
tall
.
o
,
what
folly
!
said
bathsheba
.
gabriel
was
not
visible
anywhere
.
perhaps
he
is
already
gone
!
she
said
.
tall
came
into
the
inclosure
,
and
leapt
off
,
his
face
tragic
as
morton
'
s
after
the
battle
of
shrewsbury
.
well
?
said
bathsheba
,
unwilling
to
believe
that
her
verbal
lettre
-
de
-
cachet
could
possibly
have
miscarried
.
he
says
beggars
must
not
be
choosers
.
replied
laban
.
what
!
said
the
young
farmer
,
opening
her
eyes
and
drawing
in
her
breath
for
an
outburst
.
joseph
poorgrass
retired
a
few
steps
behind
a
hurdle
.
he
says
he
shall
not
come
unless
you
request
en
to
come
civilly
and
in
a
proper
manner
,
as
becomes
any
woman
begging
a
favour
.
oh
,
oh
,
that
'
s
his
answer
!
where
does
he
get
his
airs
?
who
am
i
,
then
,
to
be
treated
like
that
?
shall
i
beg
to
a
man
who
has
begged
to
me
?
another
of
the
flock
sprang
into
the
air
,
and
fell
dead
.
the
men
looked
grave
,
as
if
they
suppressed
opinion
.
bathsheba
turned
aside
,
her
eyes
full
of
tears
.
the
strait
she
was
in
through
pride
and
shrewishness
could
not
be
disguised
longer
:
she
burst
out
crying
bitterly
;
they
all
saw
it
;
and
she
attempted
no
further
concealment
.
i
would
not
cry
about
it
,
miss
.
said
william
smallbury
,
compassionately
.
why
not
ask
him
softer
like
?
i
am
sure
he
'
d
come
then
.
gable
is
a
true
man
in
that
way
.
bathsheba
checked
her
grief
and
wiped
her
eyes
.
o
,
it
is
a
wicked
cruelty
to
me
it
is
it
is
!
she
murmured
.
and
he
drives
me
to
do
what
i
wouldn
'
t
;
yes
,
he
does
!
tall
,
come
indoors
.
after
this
collapse
,
not
very
dignified
for
the
head
of
an
establishment
,
she
went
into
the
house
,
tall
at
her
heels
.
here
she
sat
down
and
hastily
scribbled
a
note
between
the
small
convulsive
sobs
of
convalescence
which
follow
a
fit
of
crying
as
a
ground
-
swell
follows
a
storm
.
the
note
was
none
the
less
polite
for
being
written
in
a
hurry
.
she
held
it
at
a
distance
,
was
about
to
fold
it
,
then
added
these
words
at
the
bottom
:
do
not
desert
me
,
gabriel
!
she
looked
a
little
redder
in
refolding
it
,
and
closed
her
lips
,
as
if
thereby
to
suspend
till
too
late
the
action
of
conscience
in
examining
whether
such
strategy
were
justifiable
.
the
note
was
despatched
as
the
message
had
been
,
and
bathsheba
waited
indoors
for
the
result
.
it
was
an
anxious
quarter
of
an
hour
that
intervened
between
the
messenger
'
s
departure
and
the
sound
of
the
horse
'
s
tramp
again
outside
.
she
-
could
not
watch
this
time
,
but
,
leaning
over
the
old
bureau
at
which
she
had
written
the
letter
,
closed
her
eyes
,
as
if
to
keep
out
both
hope
and
fear
.
the
case
,
however
,
was
a
promising
one
.
gabriel
was
not
angry
:
he
was
simply
neutral
,
although
her
first
command
had
been
so
haughty
.
such
imperiousness
would
have
damned
a
little
less
beauty
;
and
on
the
other
hand
,
such
beauty
would
have
redeemed
a
little
less
imperiousness
.
she
went
out
when
the
horse
was
heard
,
and
looked
up
.
a
mounted
figure
passed
between
her
and
the
sky
,
and
drew
on
towards
the
field
of
sheep
,
the
rider
turning
his
face
in
receding
.
gabriel
looked
at
her
.
it
was
a
moment
when
a
woman
'
s
eyes
and
tongue
tell
distinctly
opposite
tales
.
bathsheba
looked
full
of
gratitude
,
and
she
said
:
o
,
gabriel
,
how
could
you
serve
me
so
unkindly
!
such
a
tenderly
-
shaped
reproach
for
his
previous
delay
was
the
one
speech
in
the
language
that
he
could
pardon
for
not
being
commendation
of
his
readiness
now
.
gabriel
murmured
a
confused
reply
,
and
hastened
on
.
she
knew
from
the
look
which
sentence
in
her
note
had
brought
him
.
bathsheba
followed
to
the
field
.
gabriel
was
already
among
the
turgid
,
prostrate
forms
.
he
had
flung
off
his
coat
,
rolled
up
his
shirt
-
sleeves
,
and
taken
from
his
pocket
the
instrument
of
salvation
.
it
was
a
small
tube
or
trochar
,
with
a
lance
passing
down
the
inside
;
and
gabriel
began
to
use
it
with
a
dexterity
that
would
have
graced
a
hospital
surgeon
.
passing
his
hand
over
the
sheep
'
s
left
flank
,
and
selecting
the
proper
point
,
he
punctured
the
skin
and
rumen
with
the
lance
as
it
stood
in
the
tube
;
then
he
suddenly
withdrew
the
lance
,
retaining
the
tube
in
its
place
.
a
current
of
air
rushed
up
the
tube
,
forcible
enough
to
have
extinguished
a
candle
held
at
the
orifice
.
it
has
been
said
that
mere
ease
after
torment
is
de
-
light
for
a
time
;
and
the
countenances
of
these
poor
creatures
expressed
it
now
.
forty
-
nine
operations
were
successfully
performed
.
owing
to
the
great
hurry
necessitated
by
the
far
-
gone
state
of
some
of
the
flock
,
gabriel
missed
his
aim
in
one
case
,
and
in
one
only
striking
wide
of
the
mark
,
and
inflicting
a
mortal
blow
at
once
upon
the
suffering
ewe
.
four
had
died
;
three
recovered
without
an
operation
.
the
total
number
of
sheep
which
had
thus
strayed
and
injured
themselves
so
dangerously
was
fifty
-
seven
.
when
the
love
-
led
man
had
ceased
from
his
labours
,
bathsheba
came
and
looked
him
in
the
face
.
gabriel
,
will
you
stay
on
with
me
?
she
,
said
,
smiling
winningly
,
and
not
troubling
to
bring
her
lips
quite
together
again
at
the
end
,
because
there
was
going
to
be
another
smile
soon
.
i
will
.
said
gabriel
.
and
she
smiled
on
him
again
.
men
thin
away
to
insignificance
and
oblivion
quite
as
often
by
not
making
the
most
of
good
spirits
when
they
have
them
as
by
lacking
good
spirits
when
they
are
indispensable
.
gabriel
lately
,
for
the
first
time
since
his
prostration
by
misfortune
,
had
been
independent
in
thought
and
vigorous
in
action
to
a
marked
extent
conditions
which
,
powerless
without
an
opportunity
as
an
opportunity
without
them
is
barren
,
would
have
given
him
a
sure
lift
upwards
when
the
favourable
conjunction
should
have
occurred
.
but
this
incurable
loitering
beside
bathsheba
everdene
stole
his
time
ruinously
.
the
spring
tides
were
going
by
without
floating
him
off
,
and
the
neap
might
soon
come
which
could
not
.
it
was
the
first
day
of
june
,
and
the
sheep
-
shearing
season
culminated
,
the
landscape
,
even
to
the
leanest
pasture
,
being
all
health
and
colour
.
every
green
was
young
,
every
pore
was
open
,
and
every
stalk
was
swollen
with
racing
currents
of
juice
.
god
was
palpably
present
in
the
country
,
and
the
devil
had
gone
with
the
world
to
town
.
flossy
catkins
of
the
later
kinds
,
fern
-
sprouts
like
bishops
'
croziers
,
the
square
-
headed
moschatel
,
the
odd
cuckoo

pint
,
like
an
apoplectic
saint
in
a
niche
of
malachite
,
snow
-
white
ladies
'
-
smocks
,
the
toothwort
,
approximating
to
human
flesh
,
the
enchanter
'
s
night
-
shade
,
and
the
black
-
petaled
doleful
-
bells
,
were
among
the
quainter
objects
of
the
vegetable
world
in
and
about
weatherbury
at
this
teeming
time
;
and
of
the
animal
,
the
metamorphosed
figures
of
mr
jan
coggan
,
the
master
-
shearer
;
the
second
and
third
shearers
,
who
travelled
in
the
exercise
of
their
calling
,
and

joseph
poorgrass
the

,
young
cain
ball
as
assistant
-
shearer
,
and
gabriel
oak
as
general
supervisor
.
none
of
these
were
clothed
to
any
extent
worth
mentioning
,
each
appearing
to
have
hit
in
the
matter
of
raiment
the
decent
mean
between
a
high
and
low
caste
hindoo
.
an
angularity
of
lineament
,
and
a
fixity
of
facial
machinery
in
general
,
proclaimed
that
serious
work
was
the
order
of
the
day
.
they
sheared
in
the
great
barn
,
called
for
the
nonce
the
shearing
-
barn
,
which
on
ground
-
plan
resembled
a
church
with
transepts
.
it
not
only
emulated
the
form
of
the
neighbouring
church
of
the
parish
,
but
vied
with
it
in
antiquity
.
whether
the
barn
had
ever
formed
one
of
a
group
of
conventual
buildings
nobody
seemed
to
be
aware
;
no
trace
of
such
surroundings
remained
.
the
vast
porches
at
the
sides
,
lofty
enough
to
admit
a
waggon
laden
to
its
highest
with
corn
in
the
sheaf
,
were
spanned
by
heavy
-
pointed
arches
of
stone
,
broadly
and
boldly
cut
,
whose
very
simplicity
was
the
origin
of
a
grandeur
not
apparent
in
erections
where
more
ornament
has
been
attempted
.
the
dusky
,
filmed
,
chestnut
roof
,
braced
and
tied
in
by
huge
collars
,
curves
,
and
diagonals
,
was
far
nobler
in
design
,
because
more
wealthy
in
material
,
than
nine
-
tenths
of
those
in
our
modern
churches
.
along
each
side
wall
was
a
range
of
striding
buttresses
,
throwing
deep
shadows
on
the
spaces
between
them
,
which
were
perforated
by
lancet
openings
,
combining
in
their
proportions
the
precise
requirements
both
of
beauty
and
ventilation
.
one
could
say
about
this
barn
,
what
could
hardly
be
said
of
either
the
church
or
the
castle
,
akin
to
it
in
age
and
style
,
that
the
purpose
which
had
dictated
its
original
erection
was
the
same
with
that
to
which
it
was
still
applied
.
unlike
and
superior
to
either
of
those
two
typical
remnants
of
mediaevalism
,
the
old
barn
embodied
practices
which
had
suffered
no
mutilation
at
the
hands
of
time
.
here
at
least
the
spirit
of
the
ancient
builders
was
at
one
with
the
spirit
of
the
modern
beholder
.
standing
before
this
abraded
pile
,
the
eye
regarded
its
present
usage
,
the
mind
dwelt
upon
its
past
history
,
with
a
satisfied
sense
of
functional
continuity
throughout
a
feeling
almost
of
gratitude
,
and
quite
of
pride
,
at
the
permanence
of
the
idea
which
had
heaped
it
up
.
the
fact
that
four
centuries
had
neither
proved
it
to
be
founded
on
a
mistake
,
inspired
any
hatred
of
its
purpose
,
nor
given
rise
to
any
reaction
that
had
battered
it
down
,
invested
this
simple
grey
effort
of
old
minds
with
a
repose
,
if
not
a
grandeur
,
which
a
too
curious
reflection
was
apt
to
disturb
in
its
ecclesiastical
and
military
compeers
.
for
once
medievalism
and
modernism
had
a
common
stand
-
point
.
the
lanceolate
windows
,
the
time
-
eaten
arch
-
stones
and
chamfers
,
the
orientation
of
the
axis
,
the
misty
chestnut
work
of
the
rafters
,
referred
to
no
exploded
fortifying
art
or
worn
-
out
religious
creed
.
the
defence
and
salvation
of
the
body
by
daily
bread
is
still
a
study
,
a
religion
,
and
a
desire
.
to
-
day
the
large
side
doors
were
thrown
open
towards
the
sun
to
admit
a
bountiful
light
to
the
immediate
spot
of
the
shearers
'
operations
,
which
was
the
wood
threshing
-
floor
in
the
centre
,
formed
of
thick
oak
,
black
with
age
and
polished
by
the
beating
of
flails
for
many
generations
,
till
it
had
grown
as
slippery
and
as
rich
in
hue
as
the
state
-
room
floors
of
an
elizabethan
mansion
.
here
the
shearers
knelt
,
the
sun
slanting
in
upon
their
bleached
shirts
,
tanned
arms
,
and
the
polished
shears
they
flourished
,
causing
these
to
bristle
with
a
thousand
rays
strong
enough
to
blind
a
weak
-
eyed
man
.
beneath
them
a
captive
sheep
lay
panting
,
quickening
its
pants
as
misgiving
merged
in
terror
,
till
it
quivered
like
the
hot
landscape
outside
.
this
picture
of
to
-
day
in
its
frame
of
four
hundred
years
ago
did
not
produce
that
marked
contrast
between
ancient
and
modern
which
is
implied
by
the
contrast
of
date
.
in
comparison
with
cities
,
weatherbury
was
immutable
.
the
citizen

is
the
rustic

years
ago
are
old
times
;
in
paris
ten
years
,
or
five
;
in
weatherbury
three
or
four
score
years
were
included
in
the
mere
present
,
and
nothing
less
than
a
century
set
a
mark
on
its
face
or
tone
.
five
decades
hardly
modified
the
cut
of
a
gaiter
,
the
embroidery
of
a
smock
-
frock
,
by
the
breadth
of
a
hair
.
ten
generations
failed
to
alter
the
turn
of
a
single
phrase
.
in
these
wessex
nooks
the
busy
out
-
sider
'
s
ancient
times
are
only
old
;
his
old
times
are
still
new
;
his
present
is
futurity
.
so
the
barn
was
natural
to
the
shearers
,
and
the
shearers
were
in
harmony
with
the
barn
.
the
spacious
ends
of
the
building
,
answering
ecclesiastically
to
nave
and
chancel
extremities
,
were
fenced
off
with
hurdles
,
the
sheep
being
all
collected
in
a
crowd
within
these
two
enclosures
;
and
in
one
angle
a
catching
-
pen
was
formed
,
in
which
three
or
four
sheep
were
continuously
kept
ready
for
the
shearers
to
seize
without
loss
of
time
.
in
the
background
,
mellowed
by
tawny
shade
,
were
the
three
women
,
maryann
money
,
and
temperance
and
soberness
miller
,
gathering
up
the
fleeces
and
twisting
ropes
of
wool
with
a
wimble
for
tying
them
round
.
they
were
indifferently
well
assisted
by
the
old
maltster
,
who
,
when
the
malting
season
from
october
to
april
had
passed
,
made
himself
useful
upon
any
of
the
bordering
farmsteads
.
behind
all
was
bathsheba
,
carefully
watching
the
men
to
see
that
there
was
no
cutting
or
wounding
through
carelessness
,
and
that
the
animals
were
shorn
close
.
gabriel
,
who
flitted
and
hovered
under
her
bright
eyes
like
a
moth
,
did
not
shear
continuously
,
half
his
time
being
spent
in
attending
to
the
others
and
selecting
the
sheep
for
them
.
at
the
present
moment
he
was
engaged
in
handing
round
a
mug
of
mild
liquor
,
supplied
from
a
barrel
in
the
corner
,
and
cut
pieces
of
bread
and
cheese
.
bathsheba
,
after
throwing
a
glance
here
,
a
caution
there
,
and
lecturing
one
of
the
younger
operators
who
had
allowed
his
last
finished
sheep
to
go
off
among
the
flock
without
re
-
stamping
it
with
her
initials
,
came
again
to
gabriel
,
as
he
put
down
the
luncheon
to
drag
a
frightened
ewe
to
his
shear
-
station
,
flinging
it
over
upon
its
back
with
a
dexterous
twist
of
the
arm
he
lopped
off
the
tresses
about
its
head
,
and
opened
up
the
neck
and
collar
,
his
mistress
quietly
looking
on
:
she
blushes
at
the
insult
.
murmured
bathsheba
,
watching
the
pink
flush
which
arose
and
overspread
the
neck
and
shoulders
of
the
ewe
where
they
were
left
bare
by
the
clicking
shears
a
flush
which
was
enviable
,
for
its
delicacy
,
by
many
queens
of
coteries
,
and
would
have
been
creditable
,
for
its
promptness
,
to
any
woman
in
the
world
.
poor
gabriel
'
s
soul
was
fed
with
a
luxury
of
content
by
having
her
over
him
,
her
eyes
critically
regarding
his
skilful
shears
,
which
apparently
were
going
to
gather
up
a
piece
of
the
flesh
at
every
close
,
and
yet
never
did
so
.
like
guildenstern
,
oak
was
happy
in
that
he
was
not
over
happy
.
he
had
no
wish
to
converse
with
her
:
that
his
bright
lady
and
himself
formed
one
group
,
exclusively
their
own
,
and
containing
no
others
in
the
world
,
was
enough
.
so
the
chatter
was
all
on
her
side
.
there
is
a
loquacity
that
tells
nothing
,
which
was
bathsheba
'
s
;
and
there
is
a
silence
which
says
much
:
that
was
gabriel
'
s
.
full
of
this
dim
and
temperate
bliss
,
he
went
on
to
fling
the
ewe
over
upon
her
other
side
,
covering
her
head
with
his
knee
,
gradually
running
the
shears
line
after
line
round
her
dewlap
;
thence
about
her
flank
and
back
,
and
finishing
over
the
tail
.
well
done
,
and
done
quickly
!
said
bathsheba
,
looking
at
her
watch
as
the
last
snip
resounded
.
how
long
,
miss
?
said
gabriel
,
wiping
his
brow
.
three
-
and
-
twenty
minutes
and
a
half
since
you
took
the
first
lock
from
its
forehead
.
it
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
ever
seen
one
done
in
less
than
half
an
hour
.
the
clean
,
sleek
creature
arose
from
its
fleece
how
perfectly
like
aphrodite
rising
from
the
foam
should
have
been
seen
to
be
realized
looking
startled
and
shy
at
the
loss
of
its
garment
,
which
lay
on
the
floor
in
one
soft
cloud
,
united
throughout
,
the
portion
visible
being
the
inner
surface
only
,
which
,
never
before
exposed
,
was
white
as
snow
,
and
without
flaw
or
blemish
of
the
minutest
kind
.
cain
ball
!
yes
,
mister
oak
;
here
i
be

cainy
now

forward
with
the
tar

pot

b
.
e
.
is
newly
stamped
upon
the
shorn
skin
,
and
away
the
simple
dam
leaps
,
panting
,
over
the
board
into
the
shirtless
flock
outside
.
then
up
comes
maryann
;
throws
the
loose
locks
into
the
middle
of
the
fleece
,
rolls
it
up
,
and
carries
it
into
the
background
as
three
-
and
-
a
-
half
pounds
of
unadulterated
warmth
for
the
winter
enjoyment
of
persons
unknown
and
far
away
,
who
will
,
however
,
never
experience
the
superlative
comfort
derivable
from
the
wool
as
it
here
exists
,
new
and
pure
before
the
unctuousness
of
its
nature
whilst
in
a
living
state
has
dried
,
stiffened
,
and
been
washed
out
rendering
it
just
now
as
superior
to
anything
woollen
as
cream
is
superior
to
milk
-
and
-
water
.
but
heartless
circumstance
could
not
leave
entire
gabriel
'
s
happiness
of
this
morning
.
the
rams
,
old
ewes
,
and
two
-
shear
ewes
had
duly
undergone
their
stripping
,
and
the
men
were
proceeding
with
the
shear
-
lings
and
hogs
,
when
oak
'
s
belief
that
she
was
going
to
stand
pleasantly
by
and
time
him
through
another
performance
was
painfully
interrupted
by
farmer
bold
-
wood
'
s
appearance
in
the
extremest
corner
of
the
barn
.
nobody
seemed
to
have
perceived
his
entry
,
but
there
he
certainly
was
.
boldwood
always
carried
with
him
a
social
atmosphere
of
his
own
,
which
everybody
felt
who
came
near
him
;
and
the
talk
,
which
bathsheba
'
s
presence
had
somewhat
suppressed
,
was
now
totally
suspended
.
he
crossed
over
towards
bathsheba
,
who
turned
to
greet
him
with
a
carriage
of
perfect
ease
.
he
spoke
to
her
in
low
tones
,
and
she
instinctively
modulated
her
own
to
the
same
pitch
,
and
her
voice
ultimately
even
caught
the
inflection
of
his
.
she
was
far
from
having
a
wish
to
appear
mysteriously
connected
with
him
;
but
woman
at
the
impressionable
age
gravitates
to
the
larger
body
not
only
in
her
choice
of
words
,
which
is
apparent
every
day
,
but
even
in
her
shades
of
tone
and
humour
,
when
the
influence
is
great
.
what
they
conversed
about
was
not
audible
to
gabriel
,
who
was
too
independent
to
get
near
,
though
too
concerned
to
disregard
.
the
issue
of
their
dialogue
was
the
taking
of
her
hand
by
the
courteous
farmer
to
help
her
over
the
spreading
-
board
into
the
bright
june
sunlight
outside
.
standing
beside
the
sheep
already
shorn
,
they
went
on
talking
again
.
concerning
the
flock
?
apparently
not
.
gabriel
theorized
,
not
without
truth
,
that
in
quiet
discussion
of
any
matter
within
reach
of
the
speakers
'
eyes
,
these
are
usually
fixed
upon
it
.
bathsheba
demurely
regarded
a
contemptible
straw
lying
upon
the
ground
,
in
a
way
which
suggested
less
ovine
criticism
than
womanly
embarrassment
.
she
became
more
or
less
red
in
the
cheek
,
the
blood
wavering
in
uncertain
flux
and
reflux
over
the
sensitive
space
between
ebb
and
flood
.
gabriel
sheared
on
,
constrained
and
sad
.
she
left
boldwood
'
s
side
,
and
he
walked
up
and
down
alone
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
then
she
reappeared
in
her
new
riding
-
habit
of
myrtle
-
green
,
which
fitted
her
to
the
waist
as
a
rind
fits
its
fruit
;
and
young
bob
coggan
led
-
on
-
her
mare
,
boldwood
fetching
his
own
horse
from
the
tree
under
which
it
had
been
tied
.
oak
'
s
eyes
could
not
forsake
them
;
and
in
endeavouring
to
continue
his
shearing
at
the
same
time
that
he
watched
boldwood
'
s
manner
,
he
snipped
the
sheep
in
the
groin
.
the
animal
plunged
;
