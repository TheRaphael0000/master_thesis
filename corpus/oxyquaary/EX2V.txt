room
curtains
at
windy
corner
had
been
pulled
to
meet
for
the
carpet
was
new
and
deserved
protection
from
the
august
sun
they
were
heavy
curtains
reaching
almost
to
the
ground
and
the
light
that
filtered
through
them
was
subdued
and
varied
a
poet
none
was
present
might
have
quoted
life
like
a
dome
of
many
coloured
glass
or
might
have
compared
the
curtains
to
sluice
-
gates
lowered
against
the
intolerable
tides
of
heaven
without
was
poured
a
sea
of
radiance
within
the
glory
though
visible
was
tempered
to
the
capacities
of
man
two
pleasant
people
sat
in
the
room
one
a
boy
of
nineteen
was
studying
a
small
manual
of
anatomy
and
peering
occasionally
at
a
bone
which
lay
upon
the
piano
from
time
to
time
he
bounced
in
his
chair
and
puffed
and
groaned
for
the
day
was
hot
and
the
print
small
and
the
human
frame
fearfully
made
and
his
mother
who
was
writing
a
letter
did
continually
read
out
to
him
what
she
had
written
and
continually
did
she
rise
from
her
seat
and
part
the
curtains
so
that
a
rivulet
of
light
fell
across
the
carpet
and
make
the
remark
that
they
were
still
there
where
are
not
they
said
the
boy
who
was
freddy
lucy
'
s
brother
i
tell
you
i
am
getting
fairly
sick
for
goodness
'
sake
go
out
of
my
drawing
-
room
then
cried
mrs
honeychurch
who
hoped
to
cure
her
children
of
slang
by
taking
it
literally
freddy
did
not
move
or
reply
i
think
things
are
coming
to
a
head
she
observed
rather
wanting
her
son
'
s
opinion
on
the
situation
if
she
could
obtain
it
without
undue
supplication
time
they
did
i
am
glad
that
cecil
is
asking
her
this
once
more
it
is
his
third
go
is
not
it
freddy
i
do
call
the
way
you
talk
unkind
i
did
not
mean
to
be
unkind
then
he
added
but
i
do
think
lucy
might
have
got
this
off
her
chest
in
italy
i
do
not
know
how
girls
manage
things
but
she
ca
not
have
said
'
no
'
properly
before
or
she
would
not
have
to
say
it
again
now
over
the
whole
thing
i
ca
not
explain
i
do
feel
so
uncomfortable
do
you
indeed
dear
how
interesting
i
feel
never
mind
he
returned
to
his
work
just
listen
to
what
i
have
written
to
mrs
vyse
i
said
'
dear
mrs
vyse
'
yes
mother
you
told
me
a
jolly
good
letter
i
said
'
dear
mrs
vyse
cecil
has
just
asked
my
permission
about
it
and
i
should
be
delighted
if
lucy
wishes
it
but
'
she
stopped
reading
i
was
rather
amused
at
cecil
asking
my
permission
at
all
he
has
always
gone
in
for
unconventionality
and
parents
nowhere
and
so
forth
when
it
comes
to
the
point
he
ca
not
get
on
without
me
nor
me
you
freddy
nodded
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
me
for
my
permission
also
she
exclaimed
how
very
odd
of
him
why
so
asked
the
son
and
heir
why
should
not
my
permission
be
asked
what
do
you
know
about
lucy
or
girls
or
anything
what
ever
did
you
say
i
said
to
cecil
'
take
her
or
leave
her
it
is
no
business
of
mine
'
what
a
helpful
answer
but
her
own
answer
though
more
normal
in
its
wording
had
been
to
the
same
effect
the
bother
is
this
began
freddy
then
he
took
up
his
work
again
too
shy
to
say
what
the
bother
was
mrs
honeychurch
went
back
to
the
window
freddy
you
must
come
there
they
still
are
i
do
not
see
you
ought
to
go
peeping
like
that
peeping
like
that
ca
not
i
look
out
of
my
own
window
but
she
returned
to
the
writing
-
table
observing
as
she
passed
her
son
still
page
322
freddy
snorted
and
turned
over
two
leaves
for
a
brief
space
they
were
silent
close
by
beyond
the
curtains
the
gentle
murmur
of
a
long
conversation
had
never
ceased
the
bother
is
this
i
have
put
my
foot
in
it
with
cecil
most
awfully
he
gave
a
nervous
gulp
not
content
with
'
permission
'
which
i
did
give
that
is
to
say
i
said
'
i
do
not
mind
'
well
not
content
with
that
he
wanted
to
know
whether
i
was
not
off
my
head
with
joy
he
practically
put
it
like
this
was
not
it
a
splendid
thing
for
lucy
and
for
windy
corner
generally
if
he
married
her
and
he
would
have
an
answer
he
said
it
would
strengthen
his
hand
i
hope
you
gave
a
careful
answer
dear
i
answered
'
no
'
said
the
boy
grinding
his
teeth
there
fly
into
a
stew
i
ca
not
help
it
had
to
say
it
i
had
to
say
no
he
ought
never
to
have
asked
me
ridiculous
child
cried
his
mother
you
think
you
are
so
holy
and
truthful
but
really
it
is
only
abominable
conceit
do
you
suppose
that
a
man
like
cecil
would
take
the
slightest
notice
of
anything
you
say
i
hope
he
boxed
your
ears
how
dare
you
say
no
oh
do
keep
quiet
mother
i
had
to
say
no
when
i
could
not
say
yes
i
tried
to
laugh
as
if
i
did
not
mean
what
i
said
and
as
cecil
laughed
too
and
went
away
it
may
be
all
right
but
i
feel
my
foot
'
s
in
it
oh
do
keep
quiet
though
and
let
a
man
do
some
work
no
said
mrs
honeychurch
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
considered
the
subject
i
shall
not
keep
quiet
you
know
all
that
has
passed
between
them
in
rome
you
know
why
he
is
down
here
and
yet
you
deliberately
insult
him
and
try
to
turn
him
out
of
my
house
not
a
bit
he
pleaded
i
only
let
out
i
did
not
like
him
i
do
not
hate
him
but
i
do
not
like
him
what
i
mind
is
that
he
will
tell
lucy
he
glanced
at
the
curtains
dismally
well
i
like
him
said
mrs
honeychurch
i
know
his
mother
he
is
good
he
is
clever
he
is
rich
he
is
well
connected
oh
you
need
not
kick
the
piano
he
is
well
connected
i
will
say
it
again
if
you
like
he
is
well
connected
she
paused
as
if
rehearsing
her
eulogy
but
her
face
remained
dissatisfied
she
added
and
he
has
beautiful
manners
i
liked
him
till
just
now
i
suppose
it
is
having
him
spoiling
lucy
'
s
first
week
at
home
and
it
is
also
something
that
mr
beebe
said
not
knowing
mr
beebe
said
his
mother
trying
to
conceal
her
interest
i
do
not
see
how
mr
beebe
comes
in
you
know
mr
beebe
'
s
funny
way
when
you
never
quite
know
what
he
means
he
said
'
mr
vyse
is
an
ideal
bachelor
'
i
was
very
cute
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
he
said
'
oh
he
is
like
me
better
detached
'
i
could
not
make
him
say
any
more
but
it
set
me
thinking
since
cecil
has
come
after
lucy
he
has
not
been
so
pleasant
at
least
i
ca
not
explain
you
never
can
dear
but
i
can
you
are
jealous
of
cecil
because
he
may
stop
lucy
knitting
you
silk
ties
the
explanation
seemed
plausible
and
freddy
tried
to
accept
it
but
at
the
back
of
his
brain
there
lurked
a
dim
mistrust
cecil
praised
one
too
much
for
being
athletic
was
that
it
cecil
made
one
talk
in
one
'
s
own
way
this
tired
one
was
that
it
and
cecil
was
the
kind
of
fellow
who
would
never
wear
another
fellow
'
s
cap
unaware
of
his
own
profundity
freddy
checked
himself
he
must
be
jealous
or
he
would
not
dislike
a
man
for
such
foolish
reasons
will
this
do
called
his
mother
'
dear
mrs
vyse
cecil
has
just
asked
my
permission
about
it
and
i
should
be
delighted
if
lucy
wishes
it
'
then
i
put
in
at
the
top
'
and
i
have
told
lucy
so
'
i
must
write
the
letter
out
again
'
and
i
have
told
lucy
so
but
lucy
seems
very
uncertain
and
in
these
days
young
people
must
decide
for
themselves
'
i
said
that
because
i
did
not
want
mrs
vyse
to
think
us
old
-
fashioned
she
goes
in
for
lectures
and
improving
her
mind
and
all
the
time
a
thick
layer
of
flue
under
the
beds
and
the
maid
'
s
dirty
thumb
-
marks
where
you
turn
on
the
electric
light
she
keeps
that
flat
abominably
suppose
lucy
marries
cecil
would
she
live
in
a
flat
or
in
the
country
do
not
interrupt
so
foolishly
where
was
i
oh
yes
'
young
people
must
decide
for
themselves
i
know
that
lucy
likes
your
son
because
she
tells
me
everything
and
she
wrote
to
me
from
rome
when
he
asked
her
first
'
no
i
will
cross
that
last
bit
out
it
looks
patronizing
i
will
stop
at
'
because
she
tells
me
everything
'
or
shall
i
cross
that
out
too
cross
it
out
too
said
freddy
mrs
honeychurch
left
it
in
then
the
whole
thing
runs
'
dear
mrs
vyse
cecil
has
just
asked
my
permission
about
it
and
i
should
be
delighted
if
lucy
wishes
it
and
i
have
told
lucy
so
but
lucy
seems
very

and
in

i

because
she
tells
me
everything
but
i
do
not
know
'
look
out
cried
freddy
the
curtains
parted
cecil
'
s
first
movement
was
one
of
irritation
he
could
not
bear
the
honeychurch
habit
of
sitting
in
the
dark
to
save
the
furniture
instinctively
he
give
the
curtains
a
twitch
and
sent
them
swinging
down
their
poles
light
entered
there
was
revealed
a
terrace
such
as
is
owned
by
many
villas
with
trees
each
side
of
it
and
on
it
a
little
rustic
seat
and
two
flower
-
beds
but
it
was
transfigured
by
the
view
beyond
for
windy
corner
was
built
on
the
range
that
overlooks
the
sussex
weald
lucy
who
was
in
the
little
seat
seemed
on
the
edge
of
a
green
magic
carpet
which
hovered
in
the
air
above
the
tremulous
world
cecil
entered
appearing
thus
late
in
the
story
cecil
must
be
at
once
described
he
was
medieval
like
a
gothic
statue
tall
and
refined
with
shoulders
that
seemed
braced
square
by
an
effort
of
the
will
and
a
head
that
was
tilted
a
little
higher
than
the
usual
level
of
vision
he
resembled
those
fastidious
saints
who
guard
the
portals
of
a
french
cathedral
well
educated
well
endowed
and
not
deficient
physically
he
remained
in
the
grip
of
a
certain
devil
whom
the
modern
world
knows
as
self
-
consciousness
and
whom
the
medieval
with
dimmer
vision
worshipped
as
asceticism
a
gothic
statue
implies
celibacy
just
as
a
greek
statue
implies
fruition
and
perhaps
this
was
what
mr
beebe
meant
and
freddy
who
ignored
history
and
art
perhaps
meant
the
same
when
he
failed
to
imagine
cecil
wearing
another
fellow
'
s
cap
mrs
honeychurch
left
her
letter
on
the
writing
table
and
moved
towards
her
young
acquaintance
oh
cecil
she
exclaimed
oh
cecil
do
tell
me
i
promessi
sposi
said
he
they
stared
at
him
anxiously
she
has
accepted
me
he
said
and
the
sound
of
the
thing
in
english
made
him
flush
and
smile
with
pleasure
and
look
more
human
i
am
so
glad
said
mrs
honeychurch
while
freddy
proffered
a
hand
that
was
yellow
with
chemicals
they
wished
that
they
also
knew
italian
for
our
phrases
of
approval
and
of
amazement
are
so
connected
with
little
occasions
that
we
fear
to
use
them
on
great
ones
we
are
obliged
to
become
vaguely
poetic
or
to
take
refuge
in
scriptural
reminiscences
welcome
as
one
of
the
family
said
mrs
honeychurch
waving
her
hand
at
the
furniture
this
is
indeed
a
joyous
day
i
feel
sure
that
you
will
make
our
dear
lucy
happy
i
hope
so
replied
the
young
man
shifting
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
we
mothers
simpered
mrs
honeychurch
and
then
realized
that
she
was
affected
sentimental
bombastic
all
the
things
she
hated
most
why
could
she
not
be
freddy
who
stood
stiff
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looking
very
cross
and
almost
handsome
i
say
lucy
called
cecil
for
conversation
seemed
to
flag
lucy
rose
from
the
seat
she
moved
across
the
lawn
and
smiled
in
at
them
just
as
if
she
was
going
to
ask
them
to
play
tennis
then
she
saw
her
brother
'
s
face
her
lips
parted
and
she
took
him
in
her
arms
he
said
steady
on
not
a
kiss
for
me
asked
her
mother
lucy
kissed
her
also
would
you
take
them
into
the
garden
and
tell
mrs
honeychurch
all
about
it
cecil
suggested
and
i
'
d
stop
here
and
tell
my
mother
we
go
with
lucy
said
freddy
as
if
taking
orders
yes
you
go
with
lucy
they
passed
into
the
sunlight
cecil
watched
them
cross
the
terrace
and
descend
out
of
sight
by
the
steps
they
would
descend
he
knew
their
ways
past
the
shrubbery
and
past
the
tennis
-
lawn
and
the
dahlia
-
bed
until
they
reached
the
kitchen
garden
and
there
in
the
presence
of
the
potatoes
and
the
peas
the
great
event
would
be
discussed
smiling
indulgently
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
rehearsed
the
events
that
had
led
to
such
a
happy
conclusion
he
had
known
lucy
for
several
years
but
only
as
a
commonplace
girl
who
happened
to
be
musical
he
could
still
remember
his
depression
that
afternoon
at
rome
when
she
and
her
terrible
cousin
fell
on
him
out
of
the
blue
and
demanded
to
be
taken
to
st
peter
'
s
that
day
she
had
seemed
a
typical
tourist
shrill
crude
and
gaunt
with
travel
but
italy
worked
some
marvel
in
her
it
gave
her
light
and
which
he
held
more
precious
it
gave
her
shadow
soon
he
detected
in
her
a
wonderful
reticence
she
was
like
a
woman
of
leonardo
da
vinci
'
s
whom
we
love
not
so
much
for
herself
as
for
the
things
that
she
will
not
tell
us
the
things
are
assuredly
not
of
this
life
no
woman
of
leonardo
'
s
could
have
anything
so
vulgar
as
a
story
she
did
develop
most
wonderfully
day
by
day
so
it
happened
that
from
patronizing
civility
he
had
slowly
passed
if
not
to
passion
at
least
to
a
profound
uneasiness
already
at
rome
he
had
hinted
to
her
that
they
might
be
suitable
for
each
other
it
had
touched
him
greatly
that
she
had
not
broken
away
at
the
suggestion
her
refusal
had
been
clear
and
gentle
after
it
as
the
horrid
phrase
went
she
had
been
exactly
the
same
to
him
as
before
three
months
later
on
the
margin
of
italy
among
the
flower
-
clad
alps
he
had
asked
her
again
in
bald
traditional
language
she
reminded
him
of
a
leonardo
more
than
ever
her
sunburnt
features
were
shadowed
by
fantastic
rock
at
his
words
she
had
turned
and
stood
between
him
and
the
light
with
immeasurable
plains
behind
her
he
walked
home
with
her
unashamed
feeling
not
at
all
like
a
rejected
suitor
the
things
that
really
mattered
were
unshaken
so
now
he
had
asked
her
once
more
and
clear
and
gentle
as
ever
she
had
accepted
him
giving
no
coy
reasons
for
her
delay
but
simply
saying
that
she
loved
him
and
would
do
her
best
to
make
him
happy
his
mother
too
would
be
pleased
she
had
counselled
the
step
he
must
write
her
a
long
account
glancing
at
his
hand
in
case
any
of
freddy
'
s
chemicals
had
come
off
on
it
he
moved
to
the
writing
table
there
he
saw
dear
mrs
vyse
followed
by
many
erasures
he
recoiled
without
reading
any
more
and
after
a
little
hesitation
sat
down
elsewhere
and
pencilled
a
note
on
his
knee
then
he
lit
another
cigarette
which
did
not
seem
quite
as
divine
as
the
first
and
considered
what
might
be
done
to
make
windy
corner
drawing
-
room
more
distinctive
with
that
outlook
it
should
have
been
a
successful
room
but
the
trail
of
tottenham
court
road
was
upon
it
he
could
almost
visualize
the
motor
-
vans
of
messrs
shoolbred
and
messrs
maple
arriving
at
the
door
and
depositing
this
chair
those
varnished
book
-
cases
that
writing
-
table
the
table
recalled
mrs
honeychurch
'
s
letter
he
did
not
want
to
read
that
letter
his
temptations
never
lay
in
that
direction
but
he
worried
about
it
none
the
less
it
was
his
own
fault
that
she
was
discussing
him
with
his
mother
he
had
wanted
her
support
in
his
third
attempt
to
win
lucy
he
wanted
to
feel
that
others
no
matter
who
they
were
agreed
with
him
and
so
he
had
asked
their
permission
mrs
honeychurch
had
been
civil
but
obtuse
in
essentials
while
as
for
freddy
he
is
only
a
boy
he
reflected
i
represent
all
that
he
despises
why
should
he
want
me
for
a
brother
-
in
-
law
the
honeychurches
were
a
worthy
family
but
he
began
to
realize
that
lucy
was
of
another
clay
and
perhaps
he
did
not
put
it
very
definitely
he
ought
to
introduce
her
into
more
congenial
circles
as
soon
as
possible
mr
beebe
said
the
maid
and
the
new
rector
of
summer
street
was
shown
in
he
had
at
once
started
on
friendly
relations
owing
to
lucy
'
s
praise
of
him
in
her
letters
from
florence
cecil
greeted
him
rather
critically
i
'
ve
come
for
tea
mr
vyse
do
you
suppose
that
i
shall
get
it
i
should
say
so
food
is
the
thing
one
does
get
here
do
not
sit
in
that
chair
young
honeychurch
has
left
a
bone
in
it
pfui
i
know
said
cecil
i
know
i
ca
not
think
why
mrs
honeychurch
allows
it
for
cecil
considered
the
bone
and
the
maples
'
furniture
separately
he
did
not
realize
that
taken
together
they
kindled
the
room
into
the
life
that
he
desired
i
'
ve
come
for
tea
and
for
gossip
is
not
this
news
news
i
do
not
understand
you
said
cecil
news
mr
beebe
whose
news
was
of
a
very
different
nature
prattled
forward
i
met
sir
harry
otway
as
i
came
up
i
have
every
reason
to
hope
that
i
am
first
in
the
field
he
has
bought
cissie
and
albert
from
mr
flack
has
he
indeed
said
cecil
trying
to
recover
himself
into
what
a
grotesque
mistake
had
he
fallen
was
it
likely
that
a
clergyman
and
a
gentleman
would
refer
to
his
engagement
in
a
manner
so
flippant
but
his
stiffness
remained
and
though
he
asked
who
cissie
and
albert
might
be
he
still
thought
mr
beebe
rather
a
bounder
unpardonable
question
to
have
stopped
a
week
at
windy
corner
and
not
to
have
met
cissie
and
albert
the
semi
-
detached
villas
that
have
been
run
up
opposite
the
church
i
will
set
mrs
honeychurch
after
you
i
am
shockingly
stupid
over
local
affairs
said
the
young
man
languidly
i
ca
not
even
remember
the
difference
between
a
parish
council
and
a
local
government
board
perhaps
there
is
no
difference
or
perhaps
those
are
not
the
right
names
i
only
go
into
the
country
to
see
my
friends
and
to
enjoy
the
scenery
it
is
very
remiss
of
me
italy
and
london
are
the
only
places
where
i
do
not
feel
to
exist
on
sufferance
mr
beebe
distressed
at
this
heavy
reception
of
cissie
and
albert
determined
to
shift
the
subject
let
me
see
mr
vyse
i
forget
what
is
your
profession
i
have
no
profession
said
cecil
it
is
another
example
of
my
decadence
my
attitude
quite
an
indefensible
one
is
that
so
long
as
i
am
no
trouble
to
any
one
i
have
a
right
to
do
as
i
like
i
know
i
ought
to
be
getting
money
out
of
people
or
devoting
myself
to
things
i
do
not
care
a
straw
about
but
somehow
i
'
ve
not
been
able
to
begin
you
are
very
fortunate
said
mr
beebe
it
is
a
wonderful
opportunity
the
possession
of
leisure
his
voice
was
rather
parochial
but
he
did
not
quite
see
his
way
to
answering
naturally
he
felt
as
all
who
have
regular
occupation
must
feel
that
others
should
have
it
also
i
am
glad
that
you
approve
i
dare
not
face
the
healthy
person
for
example
freddy
honeychurch
oh
freddy
'
s
a
good
sort
is
not
he
admirable
the
sort
who
has
made
england
what
she
is
cecil
wondered
at
himself
why
on
this
day
of
all
others
was
he
so
hopelessly
contrary
he
tried
to
get
right
by
inquiring
effusively
after
mr
beebe
'
s
mother
an
old
lady
for
whom
he
had
no
particular
regard
then
he
flattered
the
clergyman
praised
his
liberal
-
mindedness
his
enlightened
attitude
towards
philosophy
and
science
where
are
the
others
said
mr
beebe
at
last
i
insist
on
extracting
tea
before
evening
service
i
suppose
anne
never
told
them
you
were
here
in
this
house
one
is
so
coached
in
the
servants
the
day
one
arrives
the
fault
of
anne
is
that
she
begs
your
pardon
when
she
hears
you
perfectly
and
kicks
the
chair
-
legs
with
her
feet
the
faults
of
mary
i
forget
the
faults
of
mary
but
they
are
very
grave
shall
we
look
in
the
garden
i
know
the
faults
of
mary
she
leaves
the
dust
-
pans
standing
on
the
stairs
the
fault
of
euphemia
is
that
she
will
not
simply
will
not
chop
the
suet
sufficiently
small
they
both
laughed
and
things
began
to
go
better
the
faults
of
freddy
cecil
continued
ah
he
has
too
many
no
one
but
his
mother
can
remember
the
faults
of
freddy
try
the
faults
of
miss
honeychurch
they
are
not
innumerable
she
has
none
said
the
young
man
with
grave
sincerity
i
quite
agree
at
present
she
has
none
at
present
i
am
not
cynical
i
am
only
thinking
of
my
pet
theory
about
miss
honeychurch
does
it
seem
reasonable
that
she
should
play
so
wonderfully
and
live
so
quietly
i
suspect
that
one
day
she
will
be
wonderful
in
both
the
water
-
tight
compartments
in
her
will
break
down
and
music
and
life
will
mingle
then
we
shall
have
her
heroically
good
heroically
bad
too
heroic
perhaps
to
be
good
or
bad
cecil
found
his
companion
interesting
and
at
present
you
think
her
not
wonderful
as
far
as
life
goes
well
i
must
say
i
'
ve
only
seen
her
at
tunbridge
wells
where
she
was
not
wonderful
and
at
florence
since
i
came
to
summer
street
she
has
been
away
you
saw
her
did
not
you
at
rome
and
in
the
alps
oh
i
forgot
of
course
you
knew
her
before
no
she
was
not
wonderful
in
florence
either
but
i
kept
on
expecting
that
she
would
be
in
what
way
conversation
had
become
agreeable
to
them
and
they
were
pacing
up
and
down
the
terrace
i
could
as
easily
tell
you
what
tune
she
will
play
next
there
was
simply
the
sense
that
she
had
found
wings
and
meant
to
use
them
i
can
show
you
a
beautiful
picture
in
my
italian
diary
miss
honeychurch
as
a
kite
miss
bartlett
holding
the
string
picture
number
two
the
string
breaks
the
sketch
was
in
his
diary
but
it
had
been
made
afterwards
when
he
viewed
things
artistically
at
the
time
he
had
given
surreptitious
tugs
to
the
string
himself
but
the
string
never
broke
no
i
might
not
have
seen
miss
honeychurch
rise
but
i
should
certainly
have
heard
miss
bartlett
fall
it
has
broken
now
said
the
young
man
in
low
vibrating
tones
immediately
he
realized
that
of
all
the
conceited
ludicrous
contemptible
ways
of
announcing
an
engagement
this
was
the
worst
he
cursed
his
love
of
metaphor
had
he
suggested
that
he
was
a
star
and
that
lucy
was
soaring
up
to
reach
him
broken
what
do
you
mean
i
meant
said
cecil
stiffly
that
she
is
going
to
marry
me
the
clergyman
was
conscious
of
some
bitter
disappointment
which
he
could
not
keep
out
of
his
voice
i
am
sorry
i
must
apologize
i
had
no
idea
you
were
intimate
with
her
or
i
should
never
have
talked
in
this
flippant
superficial
way
mr
vyse
you
ought
to
have
stopped
me
and
down
the
garden
he
saw
lucy
herself
yes
he
was
disappointed
cecil
who
naturally
preferred
congratulations
to
apologies
drew
down
his
mouth
at
the
corners
was
this
the
reception
his
action
would
get
from
the
world
of
course
he
despised
the
world
as
a
whole
every
thoughtful
man
should
it
is
almost
a
test
of
refinement
but
he
was
sensitive
to
the
successive
particles
of
it
which
he
encountered
occasionally
he
could
be
quite
crude
i
am
sorry
i
have
given
you
a
shock
he
said
dryly
i
fear
that
lucy
'
s
choice
does
not
meet
with
your
approval
not
that
but
you
ought
to
have
stopped
me
i
know
miss
honeychurch
only
a
little
as
time
goes
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
discussed
her
so
freely
with
any
one
certainly
not
with
you
you
are
conscious
of
having
said
something
indiscreet
mr
beebe
pulled
himself
together
really
mr
vyse
had
the
art
of
placing
one
in
the
most
tiresome
positions
he
was
driven
to
use
the
prerogatives
of
his
profession
no
i
have
said
nothing
indiscreet
i
foresaw
at
florence
that
her
quiet
uneventful
childhood
must
end
and
it
has
ended
i
realized
dimly
enough
that
she
might
take
some
momentous
step
she
has
taken
it
she
has
learnt
you
will
let
me
talk
freely
as
i
have
begun
freely
she
has
learnt
what
it
is
to
love
the
greatest
lesson
some
people
will
tell
you
that
our
earthly
life
provides
it
was
now
time
for
him
to
wave
his
hat
at
the
approaching
trio
he
did
not
omit
to
do
so
she
has
learnt
through
you
and
if
his
voice
was
still
clerical
it
was
now
also
sincere
let
it
be
your
care
that
her
knowledge
is
profitable
to
her
grazie
tante
said
cecil
who
did
not
like
parsons
have
you
heard
shouted
mrs
honeychurch
as
she
toiled
up
the
sloping
garden
oh
mr
beebe
have
you
heard
the
news
freddy
now
full
of
geniality
whistled
the
wedding
march
youth
seldom
criticizes
the
accomplished
fact
indeed
i
have
he
cried
he
looked
at
lucy
in
her
presence
he
could
not
act
the
parson
any
longer
at
all
events
not
without
apology
mrs
honeychurch
i
am
going
to
do
what
i
am
always
supposed
to
do
but
generally
i
am
too
shy
i
want
to
invoke
every
kind
of
blessing
on
them
grave
and
gay
great
and
small
i
want
them
all
their
lives
to
be
supremely
good
and
supremely
happy
as
husband
and
wife
as
father
and
mother
and
now
i
want
my
tea
you
only
asked
for
it
just
in
time
the
lady
retorted
how
dare
you
be
serious
at
windy
corner
he
took
his
tone
from
her
there
was
no
more
heavy
beneficence
no
more
attempts
to
dignify
the
situation
with
poetry
or
the
scriptures
none
of
them
dared
or
was
able
to
be
serious
any
more
an
engagement
is
so
potent
a
thing
that
sooner
or
later
it
reduces
all
who
speak
of
it
to
this
state
of
cheerful
awe
away
from
it
in
the
solitude
of
their
rooms
mr
beebe
and
even
freddy
might
again
be
critical
but
in
its
presence
and
in
the
presence
of
each
other
they
were
sincerely
hilarious
it
has
a
strange
power
for
it
compels
not
only
the
lips
but
the
very
heart
the
chief
parallel
to
compare
one
great
thing
with
another
is
the
power
over
us
of
a
temple
of
some
alien
creed
standing
outside
we
deride
or
oppose
it
or
at
the
most
feel
sentimental
inside
though
the
saints
and
gods
are
not
ours
we
become
true
believers
in
case
any
true
believer
should
be
present
so
it
was
that
after
the
gropings
and
the
misgivings
of
the
afternoon
they
pulled
themselves
together
and
settled
down
to
a
very
pleasant
tea
-
party
if
they
were
hypocrites
they
did
not
know
it
and
their
hypocrisy
had
every
chance
of
setting
and
of
becoming
true
anne
putting
down
each
plate
as
if
it
were
a
wedding
present
stimulated
them
greatly
they
could
not
lag
behind
that
smile
of
hers
which
she
gave
them
ere
she
kicked
the
drawing
-
room
door
mr
beebe
chirruped
freddy
was
at
his
wittiest
referring
to
cecil
as
the
fiasco
family
honoured
pun
on
fiance
mrs
honeychurch
amusing
and
portly
promised
well
as
a
mother
-
in
-
law
as
for
lucy
and
cecil
for
whom
the
temple
had
been
built
they
also
joined
in
the
merry
ritual
but
waited
as
earnest
worshippers
should
for
the
disclosure
of
some
holier
shrine
of
joy
a
few
days
after
the
engagement
was
announced
mrs
honeychurch
made
lucy
and
her
fiasco
come
to
a
little
garden
-
party
in
the
neighbourhood
for
naturally
she
wanted
to
show
people
that
her
daughter
was
marrying
a
presentable
man
cecil
was
more
than
presentable
he
looked
distinguished
and
it
was
very
pleasant
to
see
his
slim
figure
keeping
step
with
lucy
and
his
long
fair
face
responding
when
lucy
spoke
to
him
people
congratulated
mrs
honeychurch
which
is
i
believe
a
social
blunder
but
it
pleased
her
and
she
introduced
cecil
rather
indiscriminately
to
some
stuffy
dowagers
at
tea
a
misfortune
took
place
a
cup
of
coffee
was
upset
over
lucy
'
s
figured
silk
and
though
lucy
feigned
indifference
her
mother
feigned
nothing
of
the
sort
but
dragged
her
indoors
to
have
the
frock
treated
by
a
sympathetic
maid
they
were
gone
some
time
and
cecil
was
left
with
the
dowagers
when
they
returned
he
was
not
as
pleasant
as
he
had
been
do
you
go
to
much
of
this
sort
of
thing
he
asked
when
they
were
driving
home
oh
now
and
then
said
lucy
who
had
rather
enjoyed
herself
is
it
typical
of
country
society
i
suppose
so
mother
would
it
be
plenty
of
society
said
mrs
honeychurch
who
was
trying
to
remember
the
hang
of
one
of
the
dresses
seeing
that
her
thoughts
were
elsewhere
cecil
bent
towards
lucy
and
said
to
me
it
seemed
perfectly
appalling
disastrous
portentous
i
am
so
sorry
that
you
were
stranded
not
that
but
the
congratulations
it
is
so
disgusting
the
way
an
engagement
is
regarded
as
public
property
a
kind
of
waste
place
where
every
outsider
may
shoot
his
vulgar
sentiment
all
those
old
women
smirking
one
has
to
go
through
it
i
suppose
they
wo
not
notice
us
so
much
next
time
but
my
point
is
that
their
whole
attitude
is
wrong
an
engagement
horrid
word
in
the
first
place
is
a
private
matter
and
should
be
treated
as
such
yet
the
smirking
old
women
however
wrong
individually
were
racially
correct
the
spirit
of
the
generations
had
smiled
through
them
rejoicing
in
the
engagement
of
cecil
and
lucy
because
it
promised
the
continuance
of
life
on
earth
to
cecil
and
lucy
it
promised
something
quite
different
personal
love
hence
cecil
'
s
irritation
and
lucy
'
s
belief
that
his
irritation
was
just
how
tiresome
she
said
could
not
you
have
escaped
to
tennis
i
do
not
play
tennis
at
least
not
in
public
the
neighbourhood
is
deprived
of
the
romance
of
me
being
athletic
such
romance
as
i
have
is
that
of
the
inglese
italianato
inglese
italianato
e
un
diavolo
incarnato
you
know
the
proverb
she
did
not
nor
did
it
seem
applicable
to
a
young
man
who
had
spent
a
quiet
winter
in
rome
with
his
mother
but
cecil
since
his
engagement
had
taken
to
affect
a
cosmopolitan
naughtiness
which
he
was
far
from
possessing
well
said
he
i
cannot
help
it
if
they
do
disapprove
of
me
there
are
certain
irremovable
barriers
between
myself
and
them
and
i
must
accept
them
we
all
have
our
limitations
i
suppose
said
wise
lucy
sometimes
they
are
forced
on
us
though
said
cecil
who
saw
from
her
remark
that
she
did
not
quite
understand
his
position
how
it
makes
a
difference
does
not
it
whether
we
fully
fence
ourselves
in
or
whether
we
are
fenced
out
by
the
barriers
of
others
she
thought
a
moment
and
agreed
that
it
did
make
a
difference
difference
cried
mrs
honeychurch
suddenly
alert
i
do
not
see
any
difference
fences
are
fences
especially
when
they
are
in
the
same
place
we
were
speaking
of
motives
said
cecil
on
whom
the
interruption
jarred
my
dear
cecil
look
here
she
spread
out
her
knees
and
perched
her
card
-
case
on
her
lap
this
is
me
that
'
s
windy
corner
the
rest
of
the
pattern
is
the
other
people
motives
are
all
very
well
but
the
fence
comes
here
we
were
not
talking
of
real
fences
said
lucy
laughing
oh
i
see
dear
poetry
she
leant
placidly
back
cecil
wondered
why
lucy
had
been
amused
i
tell
you
who
has
no
'
fences
'
as
you
call
them
she
said
and
that
'
s
mr
beebe
a
parson
fenceless
would
mean
a
parson
defenceless
lucy
was
slow
to
follow
what
people
said
but
quick
enough
to
detect
what
they
meant
she
missed
cecil
'
s
epigram
but
grasped
the
feeling
that
prompted
it
do
not
you
like
mr
beebe
she
asked
thoughtfully
i
never
said
so
he
cried
i
consider
him
far
above
the
average
i
only
denied
and
he
swept
off
on
the
subject
of
fences
again
and
was
brilliant
now
a
clergyman
that
i
do
hate
said
she
wanting
to
say
something
sympathetic
a
clergyman
that
does
have
fences
and
the
most
dreadful
ones
is
mr
eager
the
english
chaplain
at
florence
he
was
truly
insincere
not
merely
the
manner
unfortunate
he
was
a
snob
and
so
conceited
and
he
did
say
such
unkind
things
what
sort
of
things
there
was
an
old
man
at
the
bertolini
whom
he
said
had
murdered
his
wife
perhaps
he
had
no
why
'
no
'
he
was
such
a
nice
old
man
i
am
sure
cecil
laughed
at
her
feminine
inconsequence
well
i
did
try
to
sift
the
thing
mr
eager
would
never
come
to
the
point
he
prefers
it
vague
said
the
old
man
had
'
practically
'
murdered
his
wife
had
murdered
her
in
the
sight
of
god
hush
dear
said
mrs
honeychurch
absently
but
is
not
it
intolerable
that
a
person
whom
we
are
told
to
imitate
should
go
round
spreading
slander
it
was
i
believe
chiefly
owing
to
him
that
the
old
man
was
dropped
people
pretended
he
was
vulgar
but
he
certainly
was
not
that
poor
old
man
what
was
his
name
harris
said
lucy
glibly
let
'
s
hope
that
mrs
harris
there
war
not
no
sich
person
said
her
mother
cecil
nodded
intelligently
is
not
mr
eager
a
parson
of
the
cultured
type
he
asked
i
do
not
know
i
hate
him
i
'
ve
heard
him
lecture
on
giotto
i
hate
him
nothing
can
hide
a
petty
nature
i
hate
him
my
goodness
gracious
me
child
said
mrs
honeychurch
you
will
blow
my
head
off
whatever
is
there
to
shout
over
i
forbid
you
and
cecil
to
hate
any
more
clergymen
he
smiled
there
was
indeed
something
rather
incongruous
in
lucy
'
s
moral
outburst
over
mr
eager
it
was
as
if
one
should
see
the
leonardo
on
the
ceiling
of
the
sistine
he
longed
to
hint
to
her
that
not
here
lay
her
vocation
that
a
woman
'
s
power
and
charm
reside
in
mystery
not
in
muscular
rant
but
possibly
rant
is
a
sign
of
vitality
it
mars
the
beautiful
creature
but
shows
that
she
is
alive
after
a
moment
he
contemplated
her
flushed
face
and
excited
gestures
with
a
certain
approval
he
forebore
to
repress
the
sources
of
youth
nature
simplest
of
topics
he
thought
lay
around
them
he
praised
the
pine
-
woods
the
deep
lasts
of
bracken
the
crimson
leaves
that
spotted
the
hurt
-
bushes
the
serviceable
beauty
of
the
turnpike
road
the
outdoor
world
was
not
very
familiar
to
him
and
occasionally
he
went
wrong
in
a
question
of
fact
mrs
honeychurch
'
s
mouth
twitched
when
he
spoke
of
the
perpetual
green
of
the
larch
i
count
myself
a
lucky
person
he
concluded
when
i
am
in
london
i
feel
i
could
never
live
out
of
it
when
i
am
in
the
country
i
feel
the
same
about
the
country
after
all
i
do
believe
that
birds
and
trees
and
the
sky
are
the
most
wonderful
things
in
life
and
that
the
people
who
live
amongst
them
must
be
the
best
it
is
true
that
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
they
do
not
seem
to
notice
anything
the
country
gentleman
and
the
country
labourer
are
each
in
their
way
the
most
depressing
of
companions
yet
they
may
have
a
tacit
sympathy
with
the
workings
of
nature
which
is
denied
to
us
of
the
town
do
you
feel
that
mrs
honeychurch
mrs
honeychurch
started
and
smiled
she
had
not
been
attending
cecil
who
was
rather
crushed
on
the
front
seat
of
the
victoria
felt
irritable
and
determined
not
to
say
anything
interesting
again
lucy
had
not
attended
either
her
brow
was
wrinkled
and
she
still
looked
furiously
cross
the
result
he
concluded
of
too
much
moral
gymnastics
it
was
sad
to
see
her
thus
blind
to
the
beauties
of
an
august
wood
'
come
down
o
maid
from
yonder
mountain
height
'
he
quoted
and
touched
her
knee
with
his
own
she
flushed
again
and
said
what
height
'
come
down
o
maid
from
yonder
mountain
height
what
pleasure
lives
in
height
(
the
shepherd
sang
)
in
height
and
in
the
splendour
of
the
hills
'
let
us
take
mrs
honeychurch
'
s
advice
and
hate
clergymen
no
more
what
'
s
this
place
summer
street
of
course
said
lucy
and
roused
herself
the
woods
had
opened
to
leave
space
for
a
sloping
triangular
meadow
pretty
cottages
lined
it
on
two
sides
and
the
upper
and
third
side
was
occupied
by
a
new
stone
church
expensively
simple
a
charming
shingled
spire
mr
beebe
'
s
house
was
near
the
church
in
height
it
scarcely
exceeded
the
cottages
some
great
mansions
were
at
hand
but
they
were
hidden
in
the
trees
the
scene
suggested
a
swiss
alp
rather
than
the
shrine
and
centre
of
a
leisured
world
and
was
marred
only
by
two
ugly
little
villas
the
villas
that
had
competed
with
cecil
'
s
engagement
having
been
acquired
by
sir
harry
otway
the
very
afternoon
that
lucy
had
been
acquired
by
cecil
cissie
was
the
name
of
one
of
these
villas
albert
of
the
other
these
titles
were
not
only
picked
out
in
shaded
gothic
on
the
garden
gates
but
appeared
a
second
time
on
the
porches
where
they
followed
the
semicircular
curve
of
the
entrance
arch
in
block
capitals
albert
was
inhabited
his
tortured
garden
was
bright
with
geraniums
and
lobelias
and
polished
shells
his
little
windows
were
chastely
swathed
in
nottingham
lace
cissie
was
to
let
three
notice
-
boards
belonging
to
dorking
agents
lolled
on
her
fence
and
announced
the
not
surprising
fact
her
paths
were
already
weedy
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
of
a
lawn
was
yellow
with
dandelions
the
place
is
ruined
said
the
ladies
mechanically
summer
street
will
never
be
the
same
again
as
the
carriage
passed
cissie
'
s
door
opened
and
a
gentleman
came
out
of
her
stop
cried
mrs
honeychurch
touching
the
coachman
with
her
parasol
here
'
s
sir
harry
now
we
shall
know
sir
harry
pull
those
things
down
at
once
sir
harry
otway
who
need
not
be
described
came
to
the
carriage
and
said
mrs
honeychurch
i
meant
to
i
ca
not
i
really
ca
not
turn
out
miss
flack
am
i
not
always
right
she
ought
to
have
gone
before
the
contract
was
signed
does
she
still
live
rent
free
as
she
did
in
her
nephew
'
s
time
but
what
can
i
do
he
lowered
his
voice
an
old
lady
so
very
vulgar
and
almost
bedridden
turn
her
out
said
cecil
bravely
sir
harry
sighed
and
looked
at
the
villas
mournfully
he
had
had
full
warning
of
mr
flack
'
s
intentions
and
might
have
bought
the
plot
before
building
commenced
but
he
was
apathetic
and
dilatory
he
had
known
summer
street
for
so
many
years
that
he
could
not
imagine
it
being
spoilt
not
till
mrs
flack
had
laid
the
foundation
stone
and
the
apparition
of
red
and
cream
brick
began
to
rise
did
he
take
alarm
he
called
on
mr
flack
the
local
builder
a
most
reasonable
and
respectful
man
who
agreed
that
tiles
would
have
made
more
artistic
roof
but
pointed
out
that
slates
were
cheaper
he
ventured
to
differ
however
about
the
corinthian
columns
which
were
to
cling
like
leeches
to
the
frames
of
the
bow
windows
saying
that
for
his
part
he
liked
to
relieve
the
facade
by
a
bit
of
decoration
sir
harry
hinted
that
a
column
if
possible
should
be
structural
as
well
as
decorative
mr
flack
replied
that
all
the
columns
had
been
ordered
adding
and
all
the
capitals
different
one
with
dragons
in
the
foliage
another
approaching
to
the
ionian
style
another
introducing
mrs
flack
'
s
initials
every
one
different
for
he
had
read
his
ruskin
he
built
his
villas
according
to
his
desire
and
not
until
he
had
inserted
an
immovable
aunt
into
one
of
them
did
sir
harry
buy
this
futile
and
unprofitable
transaction
filled
the
knight
with
sadness
as
he
leant
on
mrs
honeychurch
'
s
carriage
he
had
failed
in
his
duties
to
the
country
-
side
and
the
country
-
side
was
laughing
at
him
as
well
he
had
spent
money
and
yet
summer
street
was
spoilt
as
much
as
ever
all
he
could
do
now
was
to
find
a
desirable
tenant
for
cissie
some
one
really
desirable
the
rent
is
absurdly
low
he
told
them
and
perhaps
i
am
an
easy
landlord
but
it
is
such
an
awkward
size
it
is
too
large
for
the
peasant
class
and
too
small
for
any
one
the
least
like
ourselves
cecil
had
been
hesitating
whether
he
should
despise
the
villas
or
despise
sir
harry
for
despising
them
the
latter
impulse
seemed
the
more
fruitful
you
ought
to
find
a
tenant
at
once
he
said
maliciously
it
would
be
a
perfect
paradise
for
a
bank
clerk
exactly
said
sir
harry
excitedly
that
is
exactly
what
i
fear
mr
vyse
it
will
attract
the
wrong
type
of
people
the
train
service
has
improved
a
fatal
improvement
to
my
mind
and
what
are
five
miles
from
a
station
in
these
days
of
bicycles
rather
a
strenuous
clerk
it
would
be
said
lucy
cecil
who
had
his
full
share
of
mediaeval
mischievousness
replied
that
the
physique
of
the
lower
middle
classes
was
improving
at
a
most
appalling
rate
she
saw
that
he
was
laughing
at
their
harmless
neighbour
and
roused
herself
to
stop
him
sir
harry
she
exclaimed
i
have
an
idea
how
would
you
like
spinsters
my
dear
lucy
it
would
be
splendid
do
you
know
any
such
yes
i
met
them
abroad
gentlewomen
he
asked
tentatively
yes
indeed
and
at
the
present
moment
homeless
i
heard
from
them
last
week
miss
teresa
and
miss
catharine
alan
i
am
really
not
joking
they
are
quite
the
right
people
mr
beebe
knows
them
too
may
i
tell
them
to
write
to
you
indeed
you
may
he
cried
here
we
are
with
the
difficulty
solved
already
how
delightful
it
is
extra
facilities
please
tell
them
they
shall
have
extra
facilities
for
i
shall
have
no
agents
'
fees
oh
the
agents
the
appalling
people
they
have
sent
me
one
woman
when
i
wrote
a
tactful
letter
you
know
asking
her
to
explain
her
social
position
to
me
replied
that
she
would
pay
the
rent
in
advance
as
if
one
cares
about
that
and
several
references
i
took
up
were
most
unsatisfactory
people
swindlers
or
not
respectable
and
oh
the
deceit
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
seamy
side
this
last
week
the
deceit
of
the
most
promising
people
my
dear
lucy
the
deceit
she
nodded
my
advice
put
in
mrs
honeychurch
is
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
lucy
and
her
decayed
gentlewomen
at
all
i
know
the
type
preserve
me
from
people
who
have
seen
better
days
and
bring
heirlooms
with
them
that
make
the
house
smell
stuffy
it
is
a
sad
thing
but
i
'
d
far
rather
let
to
some
one
who
is
going
up
in
the
world
than
to
some
one
who
has
come
down
i
think
i
follow
you
said
sir
harry
but
it
is
as
you
say
a
very
sad
thing
the
misses
alan
are
not
that
cried
lucy
yes
they
are
said
cecil
i
have
not
met
them
but
i
should
say
they
were
a
highly
unsuitable
addition
to
the
neighbourhood
do
not
listen
to
him
sir
harry
he
is
tiresome
it
is
i
who
am
tiresome
he
replied
i
ought
not
to
come
with
my
troubles
to
young
people
but
really
i
am
so
worried
and
lady
otway
will
only
say
that
i
cannot
be
too
careful
which
is
quite
true
but
no
real
help
then
may
i
write
to
my
misses
alan
please
but
his
eye
wavered
when
mrs
honeychurch
exclaimed
beware
they
are
certain
to
have
canaries
sir
harry
beware
of
canaries
they
spit
the
seed
out
through
the
bars
of
the
cages
and
then
the
mice
come
beware
of
women
altogether
only
let
to
a
man
really
he
murmured
gallantly
though
he
saw
the
wisdom
of
her
remark
men
do
not
gossip
over
tea
-
cups
if
they
get
drunk
there
'
s
an
end
of
them
they
lie
down
comfortably
and
sleep
it
off
if
they
are
vulgar
they
somehow
keep
it
to
themselves
it
does
not
spread
so
give
me
a
man
of
course
provided
he
is
clean
sir
harry
blushed
neither
he
nor
cecil
enjoyed
these
open
compliments
to
their
sex
even
the
exclusion
of
the
dirty
did
not
leave
them
much
distinction
he
suggested
that
mrs
honeychurch
if
she
had
time
should
descend
from
the
carriage
and
inspect
cissie
for
herself
she
was
delighted
nature
had
intended
her
to
be
poor
and
to
live
in
such
a
house
domestic
arrangements
always
attracted
her
especially
when
they
were
on
a
small
scale
cecil
pulled
lucy
back
as
she
followed
her
mother
mrs
honeychurch
he
said
what
if
we
two
walk
home
and
leave
you
certainly
was
her
cordial
reply
sir
harry
likewise
seemed
almost
too
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
he
beamed
at
them
knowingly
said
aha
young
people
young
people
and
then
hastened
to
unlock
the
house
hopeless
vulgarian
exclaimed
cecil
almost
before
they
were
out
of
earshot
oh
cecil
i
ca
not
help
it
it
would
be
wrong
not
to
loathe
that
man
he
is
not
clever
but
really
he
is
nice
no
lucy
he
stands
for
all
that
is
bad
in
country
life
in
london
he
would
keep
his
place
he
would
belong
to
a
brainless
club
and
his
wife
would
give
brainless
dinner
parties
but
down
here
he
acts
the
little
god
with
his
gentility
and
his
patronage
and
his
sham
aesthetics
and
every
one
even
your
mother
is
taken
in
all
that
you
say
is
quite
true
said
lucy
though
she
felt
discouraged
i
wonder
whether
whether
it
matters
so
very
much
it
matters
supremely
sir
harry
is
the
essence
of
that
garden
-
party
oh
goodness
how
cross
i
feel
how
i
do
hope
he
will
get
some
vulgar
tenant
in
that
villa
some
woman
so
really
vulgar
that
he
will
notice
it
gentlefolks
ugh
with
his
bald
head
and
retreating
chin
but
let
'
s
forget
him
this
lucy
was
glad
enough
to
do
if
cecil
disliked
sir
harry
otway
and
mr
beebe
what
guarantee
was
there
that
the
people
who
really
mattered
to
her
would
escape
for
instance
freddy
freddy
was
neither
clever
nor
subtle
nor
beautiful
and
what
prevented
cecil
from
saying
any
minute
it
would
be
wrong
not
to
loathe
freddy
and
what
would
she
reply
further
than
freddy
she
did
not
go
but
he
gave
her
anxiety
enough
she
could
only
assure
herself
that
cecil
had
known
freddy
some
time
and
that
they
had
always
got
on
pleasantly
except
perhaps
during
the
last
few
days
which
was
an
accident
perhaps
which
way
shall
we
go
she
asked
him
nature
simplest
of
topics
she
thought
was
around
them
summer
street
lay
deep
in
the
woods
and
she
had
stopped
where
a
footpath
diverged
from
the
highroad
are
there
two
ways
perhaps
the
road
is
more
sensible
as
we
are
got
up
smart
i
'
d
rather
go
through
the
wood
said
cecil
with
that
subdued
irritation
that
she
had
noticed
in
him
all
the
afternoon
why
is
it
lucy
that
you
always
say
the
road
do
you
know
that
you
have
never
once
been
with
me
in
the
fields
or
the
wood
since
we
were
engaged
have
not
i
the
wood
then
said
lucy
startled
at
his
queerness
but
pretty
sure
that
he
would
explain
later
it
was
not
his
habit
to
leave
her
in
doubt
as
to
his
meaning
she
led
the
way
into
the
whispering
pines
and
sure
enough
he
did
explain
before
they
had
gone
a
dozen
yards
i
had
got
an
idea
i
dare
say
wrongly
that
you
feel
more
at
home
with
me
in
a
room
a
room
she
echoed
hopelessly
bewildered
yes
or
at
the
most
in
a
garden
or
on
a
road
never
in
the
real
country
like
this
oh
cecil
whatever
do
you
mean
i
have
never
felt
anything
of
the
sort
you
talk
as
if
i
was
a
kind
of
poetess
sort
of
person
i
do
not
know
that
you
are
not
i
connect
you
with
a
view
a
certain
type
of
view
why
should
not
you
connect
me
with
a
room
she
reflected
a
moment
and
then
said
laughing
do
you
know
that
you
are
right
i
do
i
must
be
a
poetess
after
all
when
i
think
of
you
it
is
always
as
in
a
room
how
funny
to
her
surprise
he
seemed
annoyed
a
drawing
-
room
pray
with
no
view
yes
with
no
view
i
fancy
why
not
i
'
d
rather
he
said
reproachfully
that
connected
me
with
the
open
air
she
said
again
oh
cecil
whatever
do
you
mean
as
no
explanation
was
forthcoming
she
shook
off
the
subject
as
too
difficult
for
a
girl
and
led
him
further
into
the
wood
pausing
every
now
and
then
at
some
particularly
beautiful
or
familiar
combination
of
the
trees
she
had
known
the
wood
between
summer
street
and
windy
corner
ever
since
she
could
walk
alone
she
had
played
at
losing
freddy
in
it
when
freddy
was
a
purple
-
faced
baby
and
though
she
had
been
to
italy
it
had
lost
none
of
its
charm
presently
they
came
to
a
little
clearing
among
the
pines
another
tiny
green
alp
solitary
this
time
and
holding
in
its
bosom
a
shallow
pool
she
exclamed
the
sacred
lake
why
do
you
call
it
that
i
ca
not
remember
why
i
suppose
it
comes
out
of
some
book
it
is
only
a
puddle
now
but
you
see
that
stream
going
through
it
well
a
good
deal
of
water
comes
down
after
heavy
rains
and
ca
not
get
away
at
once
and
the
pool
becomes
quite
large
and
beautiful
then
freddy
used
to
bathe
there
he
is
very
fond
of
it
and
you
he
meant
are
you
fond
of
it
but
she
answered
dreamily
i
bathed
here
too
till
i
was
found
out
then
there
was
a
row
at
another
time
he
might
have
been
shocked
for
he
had
depths
of
prudishness
within
him
but
now
with
his
momentary
cult
of
the
fresh
air
he
was
delighted
at
her
admirable
simplicity
he
looked
at
her
as
she
stood
by
the
pool
'
s
edge
she
was
got
up
smart
as
she
phrased
it
and
she
reminded
him
of
some
brilliant
flower
that
has
no
leaves
of
its
own
but
blooms
abruptly
out
of
a
world
of
green
who
found
you
out
charlotte
she
murmured
she
was
stopping
with
us
charlotte
charlotte
poor
girl
she
smiled
gravely
a
certain
scheme
from
which
hitherto
he
had
shrank
now
appeared
practical
lucy
yes
i
suppose
we
ought
to
be
going
was
her
reply
lucy
i
want
to
ask
something
of
you
that
i
have
never
asked
before
at
the
serious
note
in
his
voice
she
stepped
frankly
and
kindly
towards
him
what
cecil
hitherto
never
not
even
that
day
on
the
lawn
when
you
agreed
to
marry
me
he
became
self
-
conscious
and
kept
glancing
round
to
see
if
they
were
observed
his
courage
had
gone
yes
up
to
now
i
have
never
kissed
you
she
was
as
scarlet
as
if
he
had
put
the
thing
most
indelicately
no
more
you
have
she
stammered
then
i
ask
you
may
i
now
of
course
you
may
cecil
you
might
before
i
ca
not
run
at
you
you
know
at
that
supreme
moment
he
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
absurdities
her
reply
was
inadequate
she
gave
such
a
business
-
like
lift
to
her
veil
as
he
approached
her
he
found
time
to
wish
that
he
could
recoil
as
he
touched
her
his
gold
pince
-
nez
became
dislodged
and
was
flattened
between
them
such
was
the
embrace
he
considered
with
truth
that
it
had
been
a
failure
passion
should
believe
itself
irresistible
it
should
forget
civility
and
consideration
and
all
the
other
curses
of
a
refined
nature
above
all
it
should
never
ask
for
leave
where
there
is
a
right
of
way
why
could
he
not
do
as
any
labourer
or
navvy
nay
as
any
young
man
behind
the
counter
would
have
done
he
recast
the
scene
lucy
was
standing
flowerlike
by
the
water
he
rushed
up
and
took
her
in
his
arms
she
rebuked
him
permitted
him
and
revered
him
ever
after
for
his
manliness
for
he
believed
that
women
revere
men
for
their
manliness
they
left
the
pool
in
silence
after
this
one
salutation
he
waited
for
her
to
make
some
remark
which
should
show
him
her
inmost
thoughts
at
last
she
spoke
and
with
fitting
gravity
emerson
was
the
name
not
harris
what
name
the
old
man
'
s
what
old
man
that
old
man
i
told
you
about
the
one
mr
eager
was
so
unkind
to
he
could
not
know
that
this
was
the
most
intimate
conversation
they
had
ever
had
the
society
out
of
which
cecil
proposed
to
rescue
lucy
was
perhaps
no
very
splendid
affair
yet
it
was
more
splendid
than
her
antecedents
entitled
her
to
her
father
a
prosperous
local
solicitor
had
built
windy
corner
as
a
speculation
at
the
time
the
district
was
opening
up
and
falling
in
love
with
his
own
creation
had
ended
by
living
there
himself
soon
after
his
marriage
the
social
atmosphere
began
to
alter
other
houses
were
built
on
the
brow
of
that
steep
southern
slope
and
others
again
among
the
pine
-
trees
behind
and
northward
on
the
chalk
barrier
of
the
downs
most
of
these
houses
were
larger
than
windy
corner
and
were
filled
by
people
who
came
not
from
the
district
but
from
london
and
who
mistook
the
honeychurches
for
the
remnants
of
an
indigenous
aristocracy
he
was
inclined
to
be
frightened
but
his
wife
accepted
the
situation
without
either
pride
or
humility
i
cannot
think
what
people
are
doing
she
would
say
but
it
is
extremely
fortunate
for
the
children
she
called
everywhere
her
calls
were
returned
with
enthusiasm
and
by
the
time
people
found
out
that
she
was
not
exactly
of
their
milieu
they
liked
her
and
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
when
mr
honeychurch
died
he
had
the
satisfaction
which
few
honest
solicitors
despise
of
leaving
his
family
rooted
in
the
best
society
obtainable
the
best
obtainable
certainly
many
of
the
immigrants
were
rather
dull
and
lucy
realized
this
more
vividly
since
her
return
from
italy
hitherto
she
had
accepted
their
ideals
without
questioning
their
kindly
affluence
their
inexplosive
religion
their
dislike
of
paper
-
bags
orange
-
peel
and
broken
bottles
a
radical
out
and
out
she
learnt
to
speak
with
horror
of
suburbia
life
so
far
as
she
troubled
to
conceive
it
was
a
circle
of
rich
pleasant
people
with
identical
interests
and
identical
foes
in
this
circle
one
thought
married
and
died
outside
it
were
poverty
and
vulgarity
for
ever
trying
to
enter
just
as
the
london
fog
tries
to
enter
the
pine
-
woods
pouring
through
the
gaps
in
the
northern
hills
but
in
italy
where
any
one
who
chooses
may
warm
himself
in
equality
as
in
the
sun
this
conception
of
life
vanished
her
senses
expanded
she
felt
that
there
was
no
one
whom
she
might
not
get
to
like
that
social
barriers
were
irremovable
doubtless
but
not
particularly
high
you
jump
over
them
just
as
you
jump
into
a
peasant
'
s
olive
-
yard
in
the
apennines
and
he
is
glad
to
see
you
she
returned
with
new
eyes
so
did
cecil
but
italy
had
quickened
cecil
not
to
tolerance
but
to
irritation
he
saw
that
the
local
society
was
narrow
but
instead
of
saying
does
that
very
much
matter
he
rebelled
and
tried
to
substitute
for
it
the
society
he
called
broad
he
did
not
realize
that
lucy
had
consecrated
her
environment
by
the
thousand
little
civilities
that
create
a
tenderness
in
time
and
that
though
her
eyes
saw
its
defects
her
heart
refused
to
despise
it
entirely
nor
did
he
realize
a
more
important
point
that
if
she
was
too
great
for
this
society
she
was
too
great
for
all
society
and
had
reached
the
stage
where
personal
intercourse
would
alone
satisfy
her
a
rebel
she
was
but
not
of
the
kind
he
understood
a
rebel
who
desired
not
a
wider
dwelling
-
room
but
equality
beside
the
man
she
loved
for
italy
was
offering
her
the
most
priceless
of
all
possessions
her
own
soul
playing
bumble
-
puppy
with
minnie
beebe
niece
to
the
rector
and
aged
thirteen
an
ancient
and
most
honourable
game
which
consists
in
striking
tennis
-
balls
high
into
the
air
so
that
they
fall
over
the
net
and
immoderately
bounce
some
hit
mrs
honeychurch
others
are
lost
the
sentence
is
confused
but
the
better
illustrates
lucy
'
s
state
of
mind
for
she
was
trying
to
talk
to
mr
beebe
at
the
same
time
oh
it
has
been
such
a
nuisance
first
he
then
they
no
one
knowing
what
they
wanted
and
every
one
so
tiresome
but
they
really
are
coming
now
said
mr
beebe
i
wrote
to
miss
teresa
a
few
days
ago
she
was
wondering
how
often
the
butcher
called
and
my
reply
of
once
a
month
must
have
impressed
her
favourably
they
are
coming
i
heard
from
them
this
morning
i
shall
hate
those
miss
alans
mrs
honeychurch
cried
just
because
they
are
old
and
silly
one
'

expected
to
say
'
how
sweet
'
i
hate
their

and
'

and
poor
lucy
serve
her
right
worn
to
a
shadow
mr
beebe
watched
the
shadow
springing
and
shouting
over
the
tennis
-
court
cecil
was
absent
one
did
not

saturn

a
tennis

ball
whose
skin
was
partially
unsewn
when
in
motion
his
orb
was
encircled
by
a

if
they
are
coming
sir
harry
will
let
them
move
in
before
the
twenty

ninth
and
he
will
cross
out
the
clause
about
whitewashing
the
ceilings
because
it
made
them
nervous
and
put
in
the
fair
wear

tear
one
that
does
not
count

high
degree
the
power
of
lashing
little
girls
to
fury

half
a

it
in

got
hurt

was
not
a
coward
and
bore
necessary
pain
as
well
as
any
man

he
hated
the
physical
violence
of
the
young
