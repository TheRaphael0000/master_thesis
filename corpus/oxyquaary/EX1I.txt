a
surging
,
seething
,
murmuring
crowd
of
beings
that
are
human
only
in
name
,
for
to
the
eye
and
ear
they
seem
naught
but
savage
creatures
,
animated
by
vile
passions
and
by
the
lust
of
vengeance
and
of
hate
.
the
hour
,
some
little
time
before
sunset
,
and
the
place
,
the
west
barricade
,
at
the
very
spot
where
,
a
decade
later
,
a
proud
tyrant
raised
an
undying
monument
to
the
nation
'
s
glory
and
his
own
vanity
.
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
the
guillotine
had
been
kept
busy
at
its
ghastly
work
:
all
that
france
had
boasted
of
in
the
past
centuries
,
of
ancient
names
,
and
blue
blood
,
had
paid
toll
to
her
desire
for
liberty
and
for
fraternity
.
the
carnage
had
only
ceased
at
this
late
hour
of
the
day
because
there
were
other
more
interesting
sights
for
the
people
to
witness
,
a
little
while
before
the
final
closing
of
the
barricades
for
the
night
.
and
so
the
crowd
rushed
away
from
the
place
de
la
greve
and
made
for
the
various
barricades
in
order
to
watch
this
interesting
and
amusing
sight
.
it
was
to
be
seen
every
day
,
for
those
aristos
were
such
fools
!
they
were
traitors
to
the
people
of
course
,
all
of
them
,
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
who
happened
to
be
descendants
of
the
great
men
who
since
the
crusades
had
made
the
glory
of
france
:
her
old
noblesse
.
their
ancestors
had
oppressed
the
people
,
had
crushed
them
under
the
scarlet
heels
of
their
dainty
buckled
shoes
,
and
now
the
people
had
become
the
rulers
of
france
and
crushed
their
former
masters
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
not
beneath
their
heel
,
for
they
went
shoeless
mostly
in
these
days
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
a
more
effectual
weight
,
the
knife
of
the
guillotine
.
and
daily
,
hourly
,
the
hideous
instrument
of
torture
claimed
its
many
victims
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
old
men
,
young
women
,
tiny
children
until
the
day
when
it
would
finally
demand
the
head
of
a
king
and
of
a
beautiful
young
queen
.
but
this
was
as
it
should
be
:
were
not
the
people
now
the
rulers
of
france
?
every
aristocrat
was
a
traitor
,
as
his
ancestors
had
been
before
him
:
for
two
hundred
years
now
the
people
had
sweated
,
and
toiled
,
and
starved
,
to
keep
a
lustful
court
in
lavish
extravagance
;
now
the
descendants
of
those
who
had
helped
to
make
those
courts
brilliant
had
to
hide
for
their
lives
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
fly
,
if
they
wished
to
avoid
the
tardy
vengeance
of
the
people
.
and
they
did
try
to
hide
,
and
tried
to
fly
:
that
was
just
the
fun
of
the
whole
thing
.
every
afternoon
before
the
gates
closed
and
the
market
carts
went
out
in
procession
by
the
various
barricades
,
some
fool
of
an
aristo
endeavoured
to
evade
the
clutches
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
.
in
various
disguises
,
under
various
pretexts
,
they
tried
to
slip
through
the
barriers
,
which
were
so
well
guarded
by
citizen
soldiers
of
the
republic
.
men
in
women
'
s
clothes
,
women
in
male
attire
,
children
disguised
in
beggars
'
rags
:
there
were
some
of
all
sorts
:
ci
-
devant
counts
,
marquises
,
even
dukes
,
who
wanted
to
fly
from
france
,
reach
england
or
some
other
equally
accursed
country
,
and
there
try
to
rouse
foreign
feelings
against
the
glorious
revolution
,
or
to
raise
an
army
in
order
to
liberate
the
wretched
prisoners
in
the
temple
,
who
had
once
called
themselves
sovereigns
of
france
.
but
they
were
nearly
always
caught
at
the
barricades
,
sergeant
bibot
especially
at
the
west
gate
had
a
wonderful
nose
for
scenting
an
aristo
in
the
most
perfect
disguise
.
then
,
of
course
,
the
fun
began
.
bibot
would
look
at
his
prey
as
a
cat
looks
upon
the
mouse
,
play
with
him
,
sometimes
for
quite
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
pretend
to
be
hoodwinked
by
the
disguise
,
by
the
wigs
and
other
bits
of
theatrical
make
-
up
which
hid
the
identity
of
a
ci
-
devant
noble
marquise
or
count
.
oh
!
bibot
had
a
keen
sense
of
humour
,
and
it
was
well
worth
hanging
round
that
west
barricade
,
in
order
to
see
him
catch
an
aristo
in
the
very
act
of
trying
to
flee
from
the
vengeance
of
the
people
.
sometimes
bibot
would
let
his
prey
actually
out
by
the
gates
,
allowing
him
to
think
for
the
space
of
two
minutes
at
least
that
he
really
had
escaped
out
of
paris
,
and
might
even
manage
to
reach
the
coast
of
england
in
safety
,
but
bibot
would
let
the
unfortunate
wretch
walk
about
ten
metres
towards
the
open
country
,
then
he
would
send
two
men
after
him
and
bring
him
back
,
stripped
of
his
disguise
.
oh
!
that
was
extremely
funny
,
for
as
often
as
not
the
fugitive
would
prove
to
be
a
woman
,
some
proud
marchioness
,
who
looked
terribly
comical
when
she
found
herself
in
bibot
'
s
clutches
after
all
,
and
knew
that
a
summary
trial
would
await
her
the
next
day
and
after
that
,
the
fond
embrace
of
madame
la
guillotine
.
no
wonder
that
on
this
fine
afternoon
in
september
the
crowd
round
bibot
'
s
gate
was
eager
and
excited
.
the
lust
of
blood
grows
with
its
satisfaction
,
there
is
no
satiety
:
the
crowd
had
seen
a
hundred
noble
heads
fall
beneath
the
guillotine
to
-
day
,
it
wanted
to
make
sure
that
it
would
see
another
hundred
fall
on
the
morrow
.
bibot
was
sitting
on
an
overturned
and
empty
cask
close
by
the
gate
of
the
barricade
;
a
small
detachment
of
citoyen
soldiers
was
under
his
command
.
the
work
had
been
very
hot
lately
.
those
cursed
aristos
were
becoming
terrified
and
tried
their
hardest
to
slip
out
of
paris
:
men
,
women
and
children
,
whose
ancestors
,
even
in
remote
ages
,
had
served
those
traitorous
bourbons
,
were
all
traitors
themselves
and
right
food
for
the
guillotine
.
every
day
bibot
had
had
the
satisfaction
of
unmasking
some
fugitive
royalists
and
sending
them
back
to
be
tried
by
the
committee
of
public
safety
,
presided
over
by
that
good
patriot
,
citoyen
foucquier
-
tinville
.
robespierre
and
danton
both
had
commended
bibot
for
his
zeal
and
bibot
was
proud
of
the
fact
that
he
on
his
own
initiative
had
sent
at
least
fifty
aristos
to
the
guillotine
.
but
to
-
day
all
the
sergeants
in
command
at
the
various
barricades
had
had
special
orders
.
recently
a
very
great
number
of
aristos
had
succeeded
in
escaping
out
of
france
and
in
reaching
england
safely
.
there
were
curious
rumours
about
these
escapes
;
they
had
become
very
frequent
and
singularly
daring
;
the
people
'
s
minds
were
becoming
strangely
excited
about
it
all
.
sergeant
grospierre
had
been
sent
to
the
guillotine
for
allowing
a
whole
family
of
aristos
to
slip
out
of
the
north
gate
under
his
very
nose
.
it
was
asserted
that
these
escapes
were
organised
by
a
band
of
englishmen
,
whose
daring
seemed
to
be
unparalleled
,
and
who
,
from
sheer
desire
to
meddle
in
what
did
not
concern
them
,
spent
their
spare
time
in
snatching
away
lawful
victims
destined
for
madame
la
guillotine
.
these
rumours
soon
grew
in
extravagance
;
there
was
no
doubt
that
this
band
of
meddlesome
englishmen
did
exist
;
moreover
,
they
seemed
to
be
under
the
leadership
of
a
man
whose
pluck
and
audacity
were
almost
fabulous
.
strange
stories
were
afloat
of
how
he
and
those
aristos
whom
he
rescued
became
suddenly
invisible
as
they
reached
the
barricades
and
escaped
out
of
the
gates
by
sheer
supernatural
agency
.
no
one
had
seen
these
mysterious
englishmen
;
as
for
their
leader
,
he
was
never
spoken
of
,
save
with
a
superstitious
shudder
.
citoyen
foucquier
-
tinville
would
in
the
course
of
the
day
receive
a
scrap
of
paper
from
some
mysterious
source
;
sometimes
he
would
find
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
,
at
others
it
would
be
handed
to
him
by
someone
in
the
crowd
,
whilst
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
sitting
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
.
the
paper
always
contained
a
brief
notice
that
the
band
of
meddlesome
englishmen
were
at
work
,
and
it
was
always
signed
with
a
device
drawn
in
red
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
little
star
-
shaped
flower
,
which
we
in
england
call
the
scarlet
pimpernel
.
within
a
few
hours
of
the
receipt
of
this
impudent
notice
,
the
citoyens
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
would
hear
that
so
many
royalists
and
aristocrats
had
succeeded
in
reaching
the
coast
,
and
were
on
their
way
to
england
and
safety
.
the
guards
at
the
gates
had
been
doubled
,
the
sergeants
in
command
had
been
threatened
with
death
,
whilst
liberal
rewards
were
offered
for
the
capture
of
these
daring
and
impudent
englishmen
.
there
was
a
sum
of
five
thousand
francs
promised
to
the
man
who
laid
hands
on
the
mysterious
and
elusive
scarlet
pimpernel
.
everyone
felt
that
bibot
would
be
that
man
,
and
bibot
allowed
that
belief
to
take
firm
root
in
everybody
'
s
mind
;
and
so
,
day
after
day
,
people
came
to
watch
him
at
the
west
gate
,
so
as
to
be
present
when
he
laid
hands
on
any
fugitive
aristo
who
perhaps
might
be
accompanied
by
that
mysterious
englishman
.
"
bah
!
"
he
said
to
his
trusted
corporal
,
"
citoyen
grospierre
was
a
fool
!
had
it
been
me
now
,
at
that
north
gate
last
week
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
citoyen
bibot
spat
on
the
ground
to
express
his
contempt
for
his
comrade
'
s
stupidity
.
"
how
did
it
happen
,
citoyen
?
"
asked
the
corporal
.
"
grospierre
was
at
the
gate
,
keeping
good
watch
,
"
began
bibot
,
pompously
,
as
the
crowd
closed
in
round
him
,
listening
eagerly
to
his
narrative
.
"
we
'
ve
all
heard
of
this
meddlesome
englishman
,
this
accursed
scarlet
pimpernel
.
he
wo
not
get
through
my
gate
,
morbleu
!
unless
he
be
the
devil
himself
.
but
grospierre
was
a
fool
.
the
market
carts
were
going
through
the
gates
;
there
was
one
laden
with
casks
,
and
driven
by
an
old
man
,
with
a
boy
beside
him
.
grospierre
was
a
bit
drunk
,
but
he
thought
himself
very
clever
;
he
looked
into
the
casks
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
most
of
them
,
at
least
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
saw
they
were
empty
,
and
let
the
cart
go
through
.
"
a
murmur
of
wrath
and
contempt
went
round
the
group
of
ill
-
clad
wretches
,
who
crowded
round
citoyen
bibot
.
"
half
an
hour
later
,
"
continued
the
sergeant
,
"
up
comes
a
captain
of
the
guard
with
a
squad
of
some
dozen
soldiers
with
him
.
`
has
a
car
gone
through
?
'
he
asks
of
grospierre
,
breathlessly
.
`
yes
,
'
says
grospierre
,
`
not
half
an
hour
ago
.
'
`
and
you
have
let
them
escape
,
'
shouts
the
captain
furiously
.
`
you
will
go
to
the
guillotine
for
this
,
citoyen

grospierre
,
aghast
.
`
aye
!
and
the
driver
was
none
other
than
that
cursed
englishman
,
the
scarlet
pimpernel
.
'
"
a
howl
of
execration
greeted
this
tale
.
citoyen
grospierre
had
paid
for
his
blunder
on

what
a
fool

oh

what
a
fool

bibot
was
laughing
so
much
at
his
own
tale
that
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
continue
.
"

he
said
after
a
while
,
"
`
remember
the
reward
;
after
them
,
they
cannot
have
gone

'
and
with
that
he
rushes
through
the
gate
followed
by
his
dozen
soldiers
.
"
"

shouted
the
crowd
,
excitedly
.

never
got

"
but
these
sallies
seemed
to
amuse
citoyen
bibot
exceedingly
;
he
laughed
until
his
sides
ached
,
and
the
tears
streamed
down
his
cheeks
.
"
nay
,
nay

"
he
said
at
last
,
"
those
aristos

not
in

cart

driver
was
not

"
"
what

"
"
no

the
captain
of
the
guard

that
damned
englishman
in
disguise
,
and
everyone
of
his
soldiers
aristos
!
"
the
crowd
this
time
said
nothing
:
the
story
certainly
savoured
of
the
supernatural
,
and
though
the
republic
had
abolished
god
,
it
had
not
quite
succeeded
in
killing
the
fear
of
the
supernatural
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
.
truly
that
englishman
must
be
the
devil
himself
.
the
sun
was
sinking
low
down
in
the
west
.
bibot
prepared
himself
to
close
the
gates
.
"
en
avant
the
carts
,
"
he
said
.
some
dozen
covered
carts
were
drawn
up
in
a
row
,
ready
to
leave
town
,
in
order
to
fetch
the
produce
from
the
country
close
by
,
for
market
the
next
morning
.
they
were
mostly
well
known
to
bibot
,
as
they
went
through
his
gate
twice
every
day
on
their
way
to
and
from
the
town
.
he
spoke
to
one
or
two
of
their
drivers
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
mostly
women
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
was
at
great
pains
to
examine
the
inside
of
the
carts
.
"

never
know

he
would
say
,
"

fool
grospierre
.
"
the
women
who
drove
the
carts
usually
spent
their
day
on
the
place
de
la
greve
,
beneath
the
platform
of
the
guillotine
,
knitting
and
gossiping
,
whilst
they
watched
the
rows
of
tumbrils
arriving
with
the
victims
the
reign
of
terror
claimed
every
day
.
it
was
great
fun
to
see
the
aristos
arriving
for
the
reception
of
madame
la
guillotine
,
and
the
places
close
by
the
platform
were
very
much
sought
after
.
bibot
,
during
the
day
,
had
been
on
duty
on
the
place
.
he
recognized
most
of
the
old
hats
,
"
tricotteuses
,
"
as
they
were
called
,
who
sat
there
and
knitted
,
whilst
head
after
head
fell
beneath
the
knife
,
and
they
themselves
got
quite
bespattered
with
the
blood
of
those
cursed
aristos
.
"

"
said
bibot
to
one
of
these
horrible
hags
,
"
what
have
you
got
there
?
"
he
had
seen
her
earlier
in
the
day
,
with
her
knitting
and
the
whip
of
her
cart
close
beside
her
.
now
she
had
fastened
a
row
of
curly
locks
to
the
whip
handle
,
all
colours
,
from
gold
to
silver
,
fair
to
dark

and
she
stroked
them
with
her
huge
,
bony
fingers
as
she
laughed
at
bibot
.
"
i
made
friends
with

lover

she
said
with
a
coarse
laugh
,

"
asked
bibot
,
who
,
hardened
soldier
that
he
was
,
could
not
help
shuddering
at
the
awful
loathsomeness
of
this
semblance
of
a
woman
,
with
her
ghastly
trophy
on
the
handle
of
her
whip
.
"
my
grandson

she
said
with
a
jerk
of
her
thumb
towards
the
inside
of
her
cart

at
the
first
mention

bibot
had
stepped
hastily
backwards
,
and
when
the
old
hag
spoke
of
the
plague
,
he
retreated
from
her
as
fast
as
he
could
.
"
curse
you

"
he
muttered
,
whilst
the
whole
crowd
hastily
avoided
the
cart
,
leaving
it
standing
all
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
place
.
the
old
hag
laughed
.
"

you

citoyen

for
being

she
said

everyone
was

struck

silent
,
filled
with
horror
for
the
loathsome
malady
,
the
one
thing
which
still
had
the
power
to
arouse
terror
and
disgust
in
these
savage
,
brutalised
creatures

"

shouted
bibot
,
hoarsely
.
and
with
another
rough
laugh
and
coarse
jest
,
the
old
hag
whipped
up
her
lean
nag
and
drove
her
cart
out
of
the
gate
.
this
incident
had
spoilt
the
afternoon
.
the
people
were
terrified
of
these
two
horrible
curses
,
the
two
maladies
which
nothing
could
cure
,
and
which
were
the
precursors
of
an
awful
and
lonely
death
.
they
hung
about
the
barricades
,
silent
and
sullen
for
a
while
,
eyeing
one
another
suspiciously
,
avoiding
each
other
as
if
by
instinct
,
lest
the
plague
lurked
already
in
their
midst
.
presently
,
as
in
the
case
of

a
captain
of
the
guard
appeared
suddenly
.

he
was
known
to
bibot

there
was
no

nothing

broken
up

snatches

made
every
honest

'

blood
boil

long

mr

fit

to

on
another
arduous

fond
of

trip
across

at

crossed
over

warm

dry
himself

he
did
so

cast
a

somewhat
suspicious
glance
at
the
two
strangers

had
quietly
resumed
their
game
of

for
a
moment
a
look

deep
earnestness

of
anxiety

clouded
his
jovial
young
face

only
for
a

;
the
next
he
turned
to

was
respectfully
touching
his
forelock

but
the
comtesse
shook
her
head
,
still
incredulously
.
to
her
it
seemed
preposterous
that
these
young
men
and
their
great
leader
,
all
of
them
rich
,
probably
wellborn
,
and
young
,
should
for
no
other
motive
than
sport
,
run
the
terrible
risks
,
which
she
knew
they
were
constantly
doing
.
their
nationality
,
once
they
had
set
foot
in
france
,
would
be
no
safeguard
to
them
.
anyone
found
harbouring
or
assisting
suspected
royalists
would
be
ruthlessly
condemned
and
summarily
executed
,
whatever
his
nationality
might
be
.
and
this
band
of
young
englishmen
had
,
to
her
own
knowledge
,
bearded
the
implacable
and
bloodthirsty
tribunal
of
the
revolution
,
within
the
very
walls
of
paris
itself
,
and
had
snatched
away
condemned
victims
,
almost
from
the
very
foot
of
the
guillotine
.
with
a
shudder
,
she
recalled
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
,
her
escape
from
paris
with
her
two
children
,
all
three
of
them
hidden
beneath
the
hood
of
a
rickety
cart
,
and
lying
amidst
a
heap
of
turnips
and
cabbages
,
not
daring
to
breathe
,
whilst
the
mob
howled
,
"

lanterne

"
at
the
awful
west
barricade

it
had
all
occurred
in
such
a
miraculous
way
;
she
and
her
husband
had
understood
that
they
had
been
placed
on
the
list
of
"
suspected
persons
,
"
which
meant
that
their
trial
and
death
were
but
a
matter
of
days
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
of
hours
,
perhaps
.
then
came
the
hope
of
salvation
;
the
mysterious
epistle

signed
with
the
enigmatical
scarlet
device
;
the
clear
,
peremptory
directions
;
the
parting
from
the
comte
de

,
which
had
torn
the
poor
wife
'

heart

the
hope
of
reunion
;
the
flight

children
;
the
covered

awful
hag

evil
