'
i
do
not
suppose
any
of
you
have
ever
heard
of
patusan
?
'
marlow
resumed
,
after
a
silence
occupied
in
the
careful
lighting
of
a
cigar
.
'
it
does
not
matter
;
there
'
s
many
a
heavenly
body
in
the
lot
crowding
upon
us
of
a
night
that
mankind
had
never
heard
of
,
it
being
outside
the
sphere
of
its
activities
and
of
no
earthly
importance
to
anybody
but
to
the
astronomers
who
are
paid
to
talk
learnedly
about
its
composition
,
weight
,
path
the
irregularities
of
its
conduct
,
the
aberrations
of
its
light
a
sort
of
scientific
scandal
-
mongering
.
thus
with
patusan
.
it
was
referred
to
knowingly
in
the
inner
government
circles
in
batavia
,
especially
as
to
its
irregularities
and
aberrations
,
and
it
was
known
by
name
to
some
few
,
very
few
,
in
the
mercantile
world
.
nobody
,
however
,
had
been
there
,
and
i
suspect
no
one
desired
to
go
there
in
person
,
just
as
an
astronomer
,
i
should
fancy
,
would
strongly
object
to
being
transported
into
a
distant
heavenly
body
,
where
,
parted
from
his
earthly
emoluments
,
he
would
be
bewildered
by
the
view
of
an
unfamiliar
heavens
.
however
,
neither
heavenly
bodies
nor
astronomers
have
anything
to
do
with
patusan
.
it
was
jim
who
went
there
.
i
only
meant
you
to
understand
that
had
stein
arranged
to
send
him
into
a
star
of
the
fifth
magnitude
the
change
could
not
have
been
greater
.
he
left
his
earthly
failings
behind
him
and
what
sort
of
reputation
he
had
,
and
there
was
a
totally
new
set
of
conditions
for
his
imaginative
faculty
to
work
upon
.
entirely
new
,
entirely
remarkable
.
and
he
got
hold
of
them
in
a
remarkable
way
.
'
stein
was
the
man
who
knew
more
about
patusan
than
anybody
else
.
more
than
was
known
in
the
government
circles
i
suspect
.
i
have
no
doubt
he
had
been
there
,
either
in
his
butterfly
-
hunting
days
or
later
on
,
when
he
tried
in
his
incorrigible
way
to
season
with
a
pinch
of
romance
the
fattening
dishes
of
his
commercial
kitchen
.
there
were
very
few
places
in
the
archipelago
he
had
not
seen
in
the
original
dusk
of
their
being
,
before
light
(
and
even
electric
light
)
had
been
carried
into
them
for
the
sake
of
better
morality
and
and
well
the
greater
profit
,
too
.
it
was
at
breakfast
of
the
morning
following
our
talk
about
jim
that
he
mentioned
the
place
,
after
i
had
quoted
poor
brierly
'
s
remark
:
let
him
creep
twenty
feet
underground
and
stay
there
.
he
looked
up
at
me
with
interested
attention
,
as
though
i
had
been
a
rare
insect
.
this
could
be
done
,
too
,
he
remarked
,
sipping
his
coffee
.
bury
him
in
some
sort
,
i
explained
.
one
does
not
like
to
do
it
of
course
,
but
it
would
be
the
best
thing
,
seeing
what
he
is
.
yes
;
he
is
young
,
stein
mused
.
the
youngest
human
being
now
in
existence
,
i
affirmed
.
schon
.
there
'
s
patusan
,
he
went
on
in
the
same
tone
.
and
the
woman
is
dead
now
,
he
added
incomprehensibly
.
'
of
course
i
do
not
know
that
story
;
i
can
only
guess
that
once
before
patusan
had
been
used
as
a
grave
for
some
sin
,
transgression
,
or
misfortune
.
it
is
impossible
to
suspect
stein
.
the
only
woman
that
had
ever
existed
for
him
was
the
malay
girl
he
called
my
wife
the
princess
,
or
,
more
rarely
,
in
moments
of
expansion
,
the
mother
of
my
emma
.
who
was
the
woman
he
had
mentioned
in
connection
with
patusan
i
ca
not
say
;
but
from
his
allusions
i
understand
she
had
been
an
educated
and
very
good
-
looking
dutch
-
malay
girl
,
with
a
tragic
or
perhaps
only
a
pitiful
history
,
whose
most
painful
part
no
doubt
was
her
marriage
with
a
malacca
portuguese
who
had
been
clerk
in
some
commercial
house
in
the
dutch
colonies
.
i
gathered
from
stein
that
this
man
was
an
unsatisfactory
person
in
more
ways
than
one
,
all
being
more
or
less
indefinite
and
offensive
.
it
was
solely
for
his
wife
'
s
sake
that
stein
had
appointed
him
manager
of
stein
&
co
'
s
trading
post
in
patusan
;
but
commercially
the
arrangement
was
not
a
success
,
at
any
rate
for
the
firm
,
and
now
the
woman
had
died
,
stein
was
disposed
to
try
another
agent
there
.
the
portuguese
,
whose
name
was
cornelius
,
considered
himself
a
very
deserving
but
ill
-
used
person
,
entitled
by
his
abilities
to
a
better
position
.
this
man
jim
would
have
to
relieve
.
but
i
do
not
think
he
will
go
away
from
the
place
,
remarked
stein
.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
.
it
was
only
for
the
sake
of
the
woman
that
i
but
as
i
think
there
is
a
daughter
left
,
i
shall
let
him
,
if
he
likes
to
stay
,
keep
the
old
house
.
'
patusan
is
a
remote
district
of
a
native
-
ruled
state
,
and
the
chief
settlement
bears
the
same
name
.
at
a
point
on
the
river
about
forty
miles
from
the
sea
,
where
the
first
houses
come
into
view
,
there
can
be
seen
rising
above
the
level
of
the
forests
the
summits
of
two
steep
hills
very
close
together
,
and
separated
by
what
looks
like
a
deep
fissure
,
the
cleavage
of
some
mighty
stroke
.
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
the
valley
between
is
nothing
but
a
narrow
ravine
;
the
appearance
from
the
settlement
is
of
one
irregularly
conical
hill
split
in
two
,
and
with
the
two
halves
leaning
slightly
apart
.
on
the
third
day
after
the
full
,
the
moon
,
as
seen
from
the
open
space
in
front
of
jim
'
s
house
(
he
had
a
very
fine
house
in
the
native
style
when
i
visited
him
)
,
rose
exactly
behind
these
hills
,
its
diffused
light
at
first
throwing
the
two
masses
into
intensely
black
relief
,
and
then
the
nearly
perfect
disc
,
glowing
ruddily
,
appeared
,
gliding
upwards
between
the
sides
of
the
chasm
,
till
it
floated
away
above
the
summits
,
as
if
escaping
from
a
yawning
grave
in
gentle
triumph
.
wonderful
effect
,
said
jim
by
my
side
.
worth
seeing
.
is
it
not
?
'
and
this
question
was
put
with
a
note
of
personal
pride
that
made
me
smile
,
as
though
he
had
had
a
hand
in
regulating
that
unique
spectacle
.
he
had
regulated
so
many
things
in
patusan
things
that
would
have
appeared
as
much
beyond
his
control
as
the
motions
of
the
moon
and
the
stars
.
'
it
was
inconceivable
.
that
was
the
distinctive
quality
of
the
part
into
which
stein
and
i
had
tumbled
him
unwittingly
,
with
no
other
notion
than
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
;
out
of
his
own
way
,
be
it
understood
.
that
was
our
main
purpose
,
though
,
i
own
,
i
might
have
had
another
motive
which
had
influenced
me
a
little
.
i
was
about
to
go
home
for
a
time
;
and
it
may
be
i
desired
,
more
than
i
was
aware
of
myself
,
to
dispose
of
him
to
dispose
of
him
,
you
understand
before
i
left
.
i
was
going
home
,
and
he
had
come
to
me
from
there
,
with
his
miserable
trouble
and
his
shadowy
claim
,
like
a
man
panting
under
a
burden
in
a
mist
.
i
cannot
say
i
had
ever
seen
him
distinctly
not
even
to
this
day
,
after
i
had
my
last
view
of
him
;
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
less
i
understood
the
more
i
was
bound
to
him
in
the
name
of
that
doubt
which
is
the
inseparable
part
of
our
knowledge
.
i
did
not
know
so
much
more
about
myself
.
and
then
,
i
repeat
,
i
was
going
home
to
that
home
distant
enough
for
all
its
hearthstones
to
be
like
one
hearthstone
,
by
which
the
humblest
of
us
has
the
right
to
sit
.
we
wander
in
our
thousands
over
the
face
of
the
earth
,
the
illustrious
and
the
obscure
,
earning
beyond
the
seas
our
fame
,
our
money
,
or
only
a
crust
of
bread
;
but
it
seems
to
me
that
for
each
of
us
going
home
must
be
like
going
to
render
an
account
.
we
return
to
face
our
superiors
,
our
kindred
,
our
friends
those
whom
we
obey
,
and
those
whom
we
love
;
but
even
they
who
have
neither
,
the
most
free
,
lonely
,
irresponsible
and
bereft
of
ties
,
even
those
for
whom
home
holds
no
dear
face
,
no
familiar
voice
,
even
they
have
to
meet
the
spirit
that
dwells
within
the
land
,
under
its
sky
,
in
its
air
,
in
its
valleys
,
and
on
its
rises
,
in
its
fields
,
in
its
waters
and
its
trees
a
mute
friend
,
judge
,
and
inspirer
.
say
what
you
like
,
to
get
its
joy
,
to
breathe
its
peace
,
to
face
its
truth
,
one
must
return
with
a
clear
conscience
.
all
this
may
seem
to
you
sheer
sentimentalism
;
and
indeed
very
few
of
us
have
the
will
or
the
capacity
to
look
consciously
under
the
surface
of
familiar
emotions
.
there
are
the
girls
we
love
,
the
men
we
look
up
to
,
the
tenderness
,
the
friendships
,
the
opportunities
,
the
pleasures
!
but
the
fact
remains
that
you
must
touch
your
reward
with
clean
hands
,
lest
it
turn
to
dead
leaves
,
to
thorns
,
in
your
grasp
.
i
think
it
is
the
lonely
,
without
a
fireside
or
an
affection
they
may
call
their
own
,
those
who
return
not
to
a
dwelling
but
to
the
land
itself
,
to
meet
its
disembodied
,
eternal
,
and
unchangeable
spirit
it
is
those
who
understand
best
its
severity
,
its
saving
power
,
the
grace
of
its
secular
right
to
our
fidelity
,
to
our
obedience
.
yes
!
few
of
us
understand
,
but
we
all
feel
it
though
,
and
i
say
all
without
exception
,
because
those
who
do
not
feel
do
not
count
.
each
blade
of
grass
has
its
spot
on
earth
whence
it
draws
its
life
,
its
strength
;
and
so
is
man
rooted
to
the
land
from
which
he
draws
his
faith
together
with
his
life
.
i
do
not
know
how
much
jim
understood
;
but
i
know
he
felt
,
he
felt
confusedly
but
powerfully
,
the
demand
of
some
such
truth
or
some
such
illusion
i
do
not
care
how
you
call
it
,
there
is
so
little
difference
,
and
the
difference
means
so
little
.
the
thing
is
that
in
virtue
of
his
feeling
he
mattered
.
he
would
never
go
home
now
.
not
he
.
never
.
had
he
been
capable
of
picturesque
manifestations
he
would
have
shuddered
at
the
thought
and
made
you
shudder
too
.
but
he
was
not
of
that
sort
,
though
he
was
expressive
enough
in
his
way
.
before
the
idea
of
going
home
he
would
grow
desperately
stiff
and
immovable
,
with
lowered
chin
and
pouted
lips
,
and
with
those
candid
blue
eyes
of
his
glowering
darkly
under
a
frown
,
as
if
before
something
unbearable
,
as
if
before
something
revolting
.
there
was
imagination
in
that
hard
skull
of
his
,
over
which
the
thick
clustering
hair
fitted
like
a
cap
.
as
to
me
,
i
have
no
imagination
(
i
would
be
more
certain
about
him
today
,
if
i
had
)
,
and
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
i
figured
to
myself
the
spirit
of
the
land
uprising
above
the
white
cliffs
of
dover
,
to
ask
me
what
i
returning
with
no
bones
broken
,
so
to
speak
had
done
with
my
very
young
brother
.
i
could
not
make
such
a
mistake
.
i
knew
very
well
he
was
of
those
about
whom
there
is
no
inquiry
;
i
had
seen
better
men
go
out
,
disappear
,
vanish
utterly
,
without
provoking
a
sound
of
curiosity
or
sorrow
.
the
spirit
of
the
land
,
as
becomes
the
ruler
of
great
enterprises
,
is
careless
of
innumerable
lives
.
woe
to
the
stragglers
!
we
exist
only
in
so
far
as
we
hang
together
.
he
had
straggled
in
a
way
;
he
had
not
hung
on
;
but
he
was
aware
of
it
with
an
intensity
that
made
him
touching
,
just
as
a
man
'
s
more
intense
life
makes
his
death
more
touching
than
the
death
of
a
tree
.
i
happened
to
be
handy
,
and
i
happened
to
be
touched
.
that
'
s
all
there
is
to
it
.
i
was
concerned
as
to
the
way
he
would
go
out
.
it
would
have
hurt
me
if
,
for
instance
,
he
had
taken
to
drink
.
the
earth
is
so
small
that
i
was
afraid
of
,
some
day
,
being
waylaid
by
a
blear
-
eyed
,
swollen
-
faced
,
besmirched
loafer
,
with
no
soles
to
his
canvas
shoes
,
and
with
a
flutter
of
rags
about
the
elbows
,
who
,
on
the
strength
of
old
acquaintance
,
would
ask
for
a
loan
of
five
dollars
.
you
know
the
awful
jaunty
bearing
of
these
scarecrows
coming
to
you
from
a
decent
past
,
the
rasping
careless
voice
,
the
half
-
averted
impudent
glances
those
meetings
more
trying
to
a
man
who
believes
in
the
solidarity
of
our
lives
than
the
sight
of
an
impenitent
death
-
bed
to
a
priest
.
that
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
was
the
only
danger
i
could
see
for
him
and
for
me
;
but
i
also
mistrusted
my
want
of
imagination
.
it
might
even
come
to
something
worse
,
in
some
way
it
was
beyond
my
powers
of
fancy
to
foresee
.
he
would
not
let
me
forget
how
imaginative
he
was
,
and
your
imaginative
people
swing
farther
in
any
direction
,
as
if
given
a
longer
scope
of
cable
in
the
uneasy
anchorage
of
life
.
they
do
.
they
take
to
drink
too
.
it
may
be
i
was
belittling
him
by
such
a
fear
.
how
could
i
tell
?
even
stein
could
say
no
more
than
that
he
was
romantic
.
i
only
knew
he
was
one
of
us
.
and
what
business
had
he
to
be
romantic
?
i
am
telling
you
so
much
about
my
own
instinctive
feelings
and
bemused
reflections
because
there
remains
so
little
to
be
told
of
him
.
he
existed
for
me
,
and
after
all
it
is
only
through
me
that
he
exists
for
you
.
i
'
ve
led
him
out
by
the
hand
;
i
have
paraded
him
before
you
.
were
my
commonplace
fears
unjust
?
i
wo
not
say
not
even
now
.
you
may
be
able
to
tell
better
,
since
the
proverb
has
it
that
the
onlookers
see
most
of
the
game
.
at
any
rate
,
they
were
superfluous
.
he
did
not
go
out
,
not
at
all
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
came
on
wonderfully
,
came
on
straight
as
a
die
and
in
excellent
form
,
which
showed
that
he
could
stay
as
well
as
spurt
.
i
ought
to
be
delighted
,
for
it
is
a
victory
in
which
i
had
taken
my
part
;
but
i
am
not
so
pleased
as
i
would
have
expected
to
be
.
i
ask
myself
whether
his
rush
had
really
carried
him
out
of
that
mist
in
which
he
loomed
interesting
if
not
very
big
,
with
floating
outlines
a
straggler
yearning
inconsolably
for
his
humble
place
in
the
ranks
.
and
besides
,
the
last
word
is
not
said
,
probably
shall
never
be
said
.
are
not
our
lives
too
short
for
that
full
utterance
which
through
all
our
stammerings
is
of
course
our
only
and
abiding
intention
?
i
have
given
up
expecting
those
last
words
,
whose
ring
,
if
they
could
only
be
pronounced
,
would
shake
both
heaven
and
earth
.
there
is
never
time
to
say
our
last
word
the
last
word
of
our
love
,
of
our
desire
,
faith
,
remorse
,
submissions
,
revolt
.
the
heaven
and
the
earth
must
not
be
shaken
,
i
suppose
at
least
,
not
by
us
who
know
so
many
truths
about
either
.
my
last
words
about
jim
shall
be
few
.
i
affirm
he
had
achieved
greatness
;
but
the
thing
would
be
dwarfed
in
the
telling
,
or
rather
in
the
hearing
.
frankly
,
it
is
not
my
words
that
i
mistrust
but
your
minds
.
i
could
be
eloquent
were
i
not
afraid
you
fellows
had
starved
your
imaginations
to
feed
your
bodies
.
i
do
not
mean
to
be
offensive
;
it
is
respectable
to
have
no
illusions
and
safe
and
profitable
and
dull
.
yet
you
,
too
,
in
your
time
must
have
known
the
intensity
of
life
,
that
light
of
glamour
created
in
the
shock
of
trifles
,
as
amazing
as
the
glow
of
sparks
struck
from
a
cold
stone
and
as
short
-
lived
,
alas
!
'
'
the
conquest
of
love
,
honour
,
men
'
s
confidence
the
pride
of
it
,
the
power
of
it
,
are
fit
materials
for
a
heroic
tale
;
only
our
minds
are
struck
by
the
externals
of
such
a
success
,
and
to
jim
'
s
successes
there
were
no
externals
.
thirty
miles
of
forest
shut
it
off
from
the
sight
of
an
indifferent
world
,
and
the
noise
of
the
white
surf
along
the
coast
overpowered
the
voice
of
fame
.
the
stream
of
civilisation
,
as
if
divided
on
a
headland
a
hundred
miles
north
of
patusan
,
branches
east
and
south
-
east
,
leaving
its
plains
and
valleys
,
its
old
trees
and
its
old
mankind
,
neglected
and
isolated
,
such
as
an
insignificant
and
crumbling
islet
between
the
two
branches
of
a
mighty
,
devouring
stream
.
you
find
the
name
of
the
country
pretty
often
in
collections
of
old
voyages
.
the
seventeenth
-
century
traders
went
there
for
pepper
,
because
the
passion
for
pepper
seemed
to
burn
like
a
flame
of
love
in
the
breast
of
dutch
and
english
adventurers
about
the
time
of
james
the
first
.
where
would
not
they
go
for
pepper
!
for
a
bag
of
pepper
they
would
cut
each
other
'
s
throats
without
hesitation
,
and
would
forswear
their
souls
,
of
which
they
were
so
careful
otherwise
:
the
bizarre
obstinacy
of
that
desire
made
them
defy
death
in
a
thousand
shapes
the
unknown
seas
,
the
loathsome
and
strange
diseases
;
wounds
,
captivity
,
hunger
,
pestilence
,
and
despair
.
it
made
them
great
!
by
heavens
!
it
made
them
heroic
;
and
it
made
them
pathetic
too
in
their
craving
for
trade
with
the
inflexible
death
levying
its
toll
on
young
and
old
.
it
seems
impossible
to
believe
that
mere
greed
could
hold
men
to
such
a
steadfastness
of
purpose
,
to
such
a
blind
persistence
in
endeavour
and
sacrifice
.
and
indeed
those
who
adventured
their
persons
and
lives
risked
all
they
had
for
a
slender
reward
.
they
left
their
bones
to
lie
bleaching
on
distant
shores
,
so
that
wealth
might
flow
to
the
living
at
home
.
to
us
,
their
less
tried
successors
,
they
appear
magnified
,
not
as
agents
of
trade
but
as
instruments
of
a
recorded
destiny
,
pushing
out
into
the
unknown
in
obedience
to
an
inward
voice
,
to
an
impulse
beating
in
the
blood
,
to
a
dream
of
the
future
.
they
were
wonderful
;
and
it
must
be
owned
they
were
ready
for
the
wonderful
.
they
recorded
it
complacently
in
their
sufferings
,
in
the
aspect
of
the
seas
,
in
the
customs
of
strange
nations
,
in
the
glory
of
splendid
rulers
.
'
in
patusan
they
had
found
lots
of
pepper
,
and
had
been
impressed
by
the
magnificence
and
the
wisdom
of
the
sultan
;
but
somehow
,
after
a
century
of
chequered
intercourse
,
the
country
seems
to
drop
gradually
out
of
the
trade
.
perhaps
the
pepper
had
given
out
.
be
it
as
it
may
,
nobody
cares
for
it
now
;
the
glory
has
departed
,
the
sultan
is
an
imbecile
youth
with
two
thumbs
on
his
left
hand
and
an
uncertain
and
beggarly
revenue
extorted
from
a
miserable
population
and
stolen
from
him
by
his
many
uncles
.
'
this
of
course
i
have
from
stein
.
he
gave
me
their
names
and
a
short
sketch
of
the
life
and
character
of
each
.
he
was
as
full
of
information
about
native
states
as
an
official
report
,
but
infinitely
more
amusing
.
he
had
to
know
.
he
traded
in
so
many
,
and
in
some
districts
as
in
patusan
,
for
instance
his
firm
was
the
only
one
to
have
an
agency
by
special
permit
from
the
dutch
authorities
.
the
government
trusted
his
discretion
,
and
it
was
understood
that
he
took
all
the
risks
.
the
men
he
employed
understood
that
too
,
but
he
made
it
worth
their
while
apparently
.
he
was
perfectly
frank
with
me
over
the
breakfast
-
table
in
the
morning
.
as
far
as
he
was
aware
(
the
last
news
was
thirteen
months
old
,
he
stated
precisely
)
,
utter
insecurity
for
life
and
property
was
the
normal
condition
.
there
were
in
patusan
antagonistic
forces
,
and
one
of
them
was
rajah
allang
,
the
worst
of
the
sultan
'
s
uncles
,
the
governor
of
the
river
,
who
did
the
extorting
and
the
stealing
,
and
ground
down
to
the
point
of
extinction
the
country
-
born
malays
,
who
,
utterly
defenceless
,
had
not
even
the
resource
of
emigrating
for
indeed
,
as
stein
remarked
,
where
could
they
go
,
and
how
could
they
get
away
?
no
doubt
they
did
not
even
desire
to
get
away
.
the
world
(
which
is
circumscribed
by
lofty
impassable
mountains
)
has
been
given
into
the
hand
of
the
high
-
born
,
and
this
rajah
they
knew
:
he
was
of
their
own
royal
house
.
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
the
gentleman
later
on
.
he
was
a
dirty
,
little
,
used
-
up
old
man
with
evil
eyes
and
a
weak
mouth
,
who
swallowed
an
opium
pill
every
two
hours
,
and
in
defiance
of
common
decency
wore
his
hair
uncovered
and
falling
in
wild
stringy
locks
about
his
wizened
grimy
face
.
when
giving
audience
he
would
clamber
upon
a
sort
of
narrow
stage
erected
in
a
hall
like
a
ruinous
barn
with
a
rotten
bamboo
floor
,
through
the
cracks
of
which
you
could
see
,
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
below
,
the
heaps
of
refuse
and
garbage
of
all
kinds
lying
under
the
house
.
that
is
where
and
how
he
received
us
when
,
accompanied
by
jim
,
i
paid
him
a
visit
of
ceremony
.
there
were
about
forty
people
in
the
room
,
and
perhaps
three
times
as
many
in
the
great
courtyard
below
.
there
was
constant
movement
,
coming
and
going
,
pushing
and
murmuring
,
at
our
backs
.
a
few
youths
in
gay
silks
glared
from
the
distance
;
the
majority
,
slaves
and
humble
dependants
,
were
half
naked
,
in
ragged
sarongs
,
dirty
with
ashes
and
mud
-
stains
.
i
had
never
seen
jim
look
so
grave
,
so
self
-
possessed
,
in
an
impenetrable
,
impressive
way
.
in
the
midst
of
these
dark
-
faced
men
,
his
stalwart
figure
in
white
apparel
,
the
gleaming
clusters
of
his
fair
hair
,
seemed
to
catch
all
the
sunshine
that
trickled
through
the
cracks
in
the
closed
shutters
of
that
dim
hall
,
with
its
walls
of
mats
and
a
roof
of
thatch
.
he
appeared
like
a
creature
not
only
of
another
kind
but
of
another
essence
.
had
they
not
seen
him
come
up
in
a
canoe
they
might
have
thought
he
had
descended
upon
them
from
the
clouds
.
he
did
,
however
,
come
in
a
crazy
dug
-
out
,
sitting
(
very
still
and
with
his
knees
together
,
for
fear
of
overturning
the
thing
)
sitting
on
a
tin
box
which
i
had
lent
him
nursing
on
his
lap
a
revolver
of
the
navy
pattern
presented
by
me
on
parting
which
,
through
an
interposition
of
providence
,
or
through
some
wrong
-
headed
notion
,
that
was
just
like
him
,
or
else
from
sheer
instinctive
sagacity
,
he
had
decided
to
carry
unloaded
.
that
'
s
how
he
ascended
the
patusan
river
.
nothing
could
have
been
more
prosaic
and
more
unsafe
,
more
extravagantly
casual
,
more
lonely
.
strange
,
this
fatality
that
would
cast
the
complexion
of
a
flight
upon
all
his
acts
,
of
impulsive
unreflecting
desertion
of
a
jump
into
the
unknown
.
'
it
is
precisely
the
casualness
of
it
that
strikes
me
most
.
neither
stein
nor
i
had
a
clear
conception
of
what
might
be
on
the
other
side
when
we
,
metaphorically
speaking
,
took
him
up
and
hove
him
over
the
wall
with
scant
ceremony
.
at
the
moment
i
merely
wished
to
achieve
his
disappearance
;
stein
characteristically
enough
had
a
sentimental
motive
.
he
had
a
notion
of
paying
off
(
in
kind
,
i
suppose
)
the
old
debt
he
had
never
forgotten
.
indeed
he
had
been
all
his
life
especially
friendly
to
anybody
from
the
british
isles
.
his
late
benefactor
,
it
is
true
,
was
a
scot
even
to
the
length
of
being
called
alexander
mcneil
and
jim
came
from
a
long
way
south
of
the
tweed
;
but
at
the
distance
of
six
or
seven
thousand
miles
great
britain
,
though
never
diminished
,
looks
foreshortened
enough
even
to
its
own
children
to
rob
such
details
of
their
importance
.
stein
was
excusable
,
and
his
hinted
intentions
were
so
generous
that
i
begged
him
most
earnestly
to
keep
them
secret
for
a
time
.
i
felt
that
no
consideration
of
personal
advantage
should
be
allowed
to
influence
jim
;
that
not
even
the
risk
of
such
influence
should
be
run
.
we
had
to
deal
with
another
sort
of
reality
.
he
wanted
a
refuge
,
and
a
refuge
at
the
cost
of
danger
should
be
offered
him
nothing
more
.
'
upon
every
other
point
i
was
perfectly
frank
with
him
,
and
i
even
(
as
i
believed
at
the
time
)
exaggerated
the
danger
of
the
undertaking
.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
not
do
it
justice
;
his
first
day
in
patusan
was
nearly
his
last
would
have
been
his
last
if
he
had
not
been
so
reckless
or
so
hard
on
himself
and
had
condescended
to
load
that
revolver
.
i
remember
,
as
i
unfolded
our
precious
scheme
for
his
retreat
,
how
his
stubborn
but
weary
resignation
was
gradually
replaced
by
surprise
,
interest
,
wonder
,
and
by
boyish
eagerness
.
this
was
a
chance
he
had
been
dreaming
of
.
he
could
not
think
how
he
merited
that
i
he
would
be
shot
if
he
could
see
to
what
he
owed
and
it
was
stein
,
stein
the
merchant
,
who
but
of
course
it
was
me
he
had
to
i
cut
him
short
.
he
was
not
articulate
,
and
his
gratitude
caused
me
inexplicable
pain
.
i
told
him
that
if
he
owed
this
chance
to
any
one
especially
,
it
was
to
an
old
scot
of
whom
he
had
never
heard
,
who
had
died
many
years
ago
,
of
whom
little
was
remembered
besides
a
roaring
voice
and
a
rough
sort
of
honesty
.
there
was
really
no
one
to
receive
his
thanks
.
stein
was
passing
on
to
a
young
man
the
help
he
had
received
in
his
own
young
days
,
and
i
had
done
no
more
than
to
mention
his
name
.
upon
this
he
coloured
,
and
,
twisting
a
bit
of
paper
in
his
fingers
,
he
remarked
bashfully
that
i
had
always
trusted
him
.
'
i
admitted
that
such
was
the
case
,
and
added
after
a
pause
that
i
wished
he
had
been
able
to
follow
my
example
.
you
think
i
don
'
t
?
he
asked
uneasily
,
and
remarked
in
a
mutter
that
one
had
to
get
some
sort
of
show
first
;
then
brightening
up
,
and
in
a
loud
voice
he
protested
he
would
give
me
no
occasion
to
regret
my
confidence
,
which
which
do
not
misapprehend
,
i
interrupted
.
it
is
not
in
your
power
to
make
me
regret
anything
.
there
would
be
no
regrets
;
but
if
there
were
,
it
would
be
altogether
my
own
affair
:
on
the
other
hand
,
i
wished
him
to
understand
clearly
that
this
arrangement
,
this
this
experiment
,
was
his
own
doing
;
he
was
responsible
for
it
and
no
one
else
.
why
?
why
,
he
stammered
,
this
is
the
very
thing
that
i
i
begged
him
not
to
be
dense
,
and
he
looked
more
puzzled
than
ever
.
he
was
in
a
fair
way
to
make
life
intolerable
to
himself
do
you
think
so
?
he
asked
,
disturbed
;
but
in
a
moment
added
confidently
,
i
was
going
on
though
.
was
i
not
?
it
was
impossible
to
be
angry
with
him
:
i
could
not
help
a
smile
,
and
told
him
that
in
the
old
days
people
who
went
on
like
this
were
on
the
way
of
becoming
hermits
in
a
wilderness
.
hermits
be
hanged
!
he
commented
with
engaging
impulsiveness
.
of
course
he
did
not
mind
a
wilderness
.
i
was
glad
of
it
,
i
said
.
that
was
where
he
would
be
going
to
.
he
would
find
it
lively
enough
,
i
ventured
to
promise
.
yes
,
yes
,
he
said
,
keenly
.
he
had
shown
a
desire
,
i
continued
inflexibly
,
to
go
out
and
shut
the
door
after
him
.
did
i
?
he
interrupted
in
a
strange
access
of
gloom
that
seemed
to
envelop
him
from
head
to
foot
like
the
shadow
of
a
passing
cloud
.
he
was
wonderfully
expressive
after
all
.
wonderfully
!
did
i
?
he
repeated
bitterly
.
you
ca
not
say
i
made
much
noise
about
it
.
and
i
can
keep
it
up
,
too
only
,
confound
it
!
you
show
me
a
door
.
very
well
.
pass
on
,
i
struck
in
.
i
could
make
him
a
solemn
promise
that
it
would
be
shut
behind
him
with
a
vengeance
.
his
fate
,
whatever
it
was
,
would
be
ignored
,
because
the
country
,
for
all
its
rotten
state
,
was
not
judged
ripe
for
interference
.
once
he
got
in
,
it
would
be
for
the
outside
world
as
though
he
had
never
existed
.
he
would
have
nothing
but
the
soles
of
his
two
feet
to
stand
upon
,
and
he
would
have
first
to
find
his
ground
at
that
.
never
existed
that
'
s
it
,
by
jove
,
he
murmured
to
himself
.
his
eyes
,
fastened
upon
my
lips
,
sparkled
.
if
he
had
thoroughly
understood
the
conditions
,
i
concluded
,
he
had
better
jump
into
the
first
gharry
he
could
see
and
drive
on
to
stein
'
s
house
for
his
final
instructions
.
he
flung
out
of
the
room
before
i
had
fairly
finished
speaking
.
'
'
he
did
not
return
till
next
morning
.
he
had
been
kept
to
dinner
and
for
the
night
.
there
never
had
been
such
a
wonderful
man
as
mr
stein
.
he
had
in
his
pocket
a
letter
for
cornelius
(
the
johnnie
who
'
s
going
to
get
the
sack
,
he
explained
,
with
a
momentary
drop
in
his
elation
)
,
and
he
exhibited
with
glee
a
silver
ring
,
such
as
natives
use
,
worn
down
very
thin
and
showing
faint
traces
of
chasing
.
'
this
was
his
introduction
to
an
old
chap
called
doramin
one
of
the
principal
men
out
there
a
big
pot
who
had
been
mr
stein
'
s
friend
in
that
country
where
he
had
all
these
adventures
.
mr
stein
called
him
war
-
comrade
.
war
-
comrade
was
good
.
was
not
it
?
and
did
not
mr
stein
speak
english
wonderfully
well
?
said
he
had
learned
it
in
celebes
of
all
places
!
that
was
awfully
funny
.
was
it
not
?
he
did
speak
with
an
accent
a
twang
did
i
notice
?
that
chap
doramin
had
given
him
the
ring
.
they
had
exchanged
presents
when
they
parted
for
the
last
time
.
sort
of
promising
eternal
friendship
.
he
called
it
fine
did
i
not
?
they
had
to
make
a
dash
for
dear
life
out
of
the
country
when
that
mohammed
mohammed
what
'
s
-
his
-
name
had
been
killed
.
i
knew
the
story
,
of
course
.
seemed
a
beastly
shame
,
did
not
it
?
'
he
ran
on
like
this
,
forgetting
his
plate
,
with
a
knife
and
fork
in
hand
(
he
had
found
me
at
tiffin
)
,
slightly
flushed
,
and
with
his
eyes
darkened
many
shades
,
which
was
with
him
a
sign
of
excitement
.
the
ring
was
a
sort
of
credential
(
it
is
like
something
you
read
of
in
books
,
he
threw
in
appreciatively
)
and
doramin
would
do
his
best
for
him
.
mr
stein
had
been
the
means
of
saving
that
chap
'
s
life
on
some
occasion
;
purely
by
accident
,
mr
stein
had
said
,
but
he
jim
had
his
own
opinion
about
that
.
mr
stein
was
just
the
man
to
look
out
for
such
accidents
.
no
matter
.
accident
or
purpose
,
this
would
serve
his
turn
immensely
.
hoped
to
goodness
the
jolly
old
beggar
had
not
gone
off
the
hooks
meantime
.
mr
stein
could
not
tell
.
there
had
been
no
news
for
more
than
a
year
;
they
were
kicking
up
no
end
of
an
all
-
fired
row
amongst
themselves
,
and
the
river
was
closed
.
jolly
awkward
,
this
;
but
,
no
fear
;
he
would
manage
to
find
a
crack
to
get
in
.
'
he
impressed
,
almost
frightened
,
me
with
his
elated
rattle
.
he
was
voluble
like
a
youngster
on
the
eve
of
a
long
holiday
with
a
prospect
of
delightful
scrapes
,
and
such
an
attitude
of
mind
in
a
grown
man
and
in
this
connection
had
in
it
something
phenomenal
,
a
little
mad
,
dangerous
,
unsafe
.
i
was
on
the
point
of
entreating
him
to
take
things
seriously
when
he
dropped
his
knife
and
fork
(
he
had
begun
eating
,
or
rather
swallowing
food
,
as
it
were
,
unconsciously
)
,
and
began
a
search
all
round
his
plate
.
the
ring
!
the
ring
!
where
the
devil
ah
!
here
it
was
he
closed
his
big
hand
on
it
,
and
tried
all
his
pockets
one
after
another
.
jove
!
would
not
do
to
lose
the
thing
.
he
meditated
gravely
over
his
fist
.
had
it
?
would
hang
the
bally
affair
round
his
neck
!
and
he
proceeded
to
do
this
immediately
,
producing
a
string
(
which
looked
like
a
bit
of
a
cotton
shoe
-
lace
)
for
the
purpose
.
there
!
that
would
do
the
trick
!
it
would
be
the
deuce
if
he
seemed
to
catch
sight
of
my
face
for
the
first
time
,
and
it
steadied
him
a
little
.
i
probably
did
not
realise
,
he
said
with
a
naive
gravity
,
how
much
importance
he
attached
to
that
token
.
it
meant
a
friend
;
and
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
a
friend
.
he
knew
something
about
that
.
he
nodded
at
me
expressively
,
but
before
my
disclaiming
gesture
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
and
for
a
while
sat
silent
,
playing
thoughtfully
with
the
bread
-
crumbs
on
the
cloth
slam
the
door
that
was
jolly
well
put
,
he
cried
,
and
jumping
up
,
began
to
pace
the
room
,
reminding
me
by
the
set
of
the
shoulders
,
the
turn
of
his
head
,
the
headlong
and
uneven
stride
,
of
that
night
when
he
had
paced
thus
,
confessing
,
explaining
what
you
will
but
,
in
the
last
instance
,
living
living
before
me
,
under
his
own
little
cloud
,
with
all
his
unconscious
subtlety
which
could
draw
consolation
from
the
very
source
of
sorrow
.
it
was
the
same
mood
,
the
same
and
different
,
like
a
fickle
companion
that
to
-
day
guiding
you
on
the
true
path
,
with
the
same
eyes
,
the
same
step
,
the
same
impulse
,
to
-
morrow
will
lead
you
hopelessly
astray
.
his
tread
was
assured
,
his
straying
,
darkened
eyes
seemed
to
search
the
room
for
something
.
one
of
his
footfalls
somehow
sounded
louder
than
the
other
the
fault
of
his
boots
probably
and
gave
a
curious
impression
of
an
invisible
halt
in
his
gait
.
one
of
his
hands
was
rammed
deep
into
his
trousers
'
pocket
,
the
other
waved
suddenly
above
his
head
.
slam
the
door
!
he
shouted
.
i
'
ve
been
waiting
for
that
.
i
will
show
yet
i
will
i
am
ready
for
any
confounded
thing
i
'
ve
been
dreaming
of
it
jove
!
get
out
of
this
.
jove
!
this
is
luck
at
last
you
wait
.
i
will
'
he
tossed
his
head
fearlessly
,
and
i
confess
that
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
our
acquaintance
i
perceived
myself
unexpectedly
to
be
thoroughly
sick
of
him
.
why
these
vapourings
?
he
was
stumping
about
the
room
flourishing
his
arm
absurdly
,
and
now
and
then
feeling
on
his
breast
for
the
ring
under
his
clothes
.
where
was
the
sense
of
such
exaltation
in
a
man
appointed
to
be
a
trading
-
clerk
,
and
in
a
place
where
there
was
no
trade
at
that
?
why
hurl
defiance
at
the
universe
?
this
was
not
a
proper
frame
of
mind
to
approach
any
undertaking
;
an
improper
frame
of
mind
not
only
for
him
,
i
said
,
but
for
any
man
.
he
stood
still
over
me
.
did
i
think
so
?
he
asked
,
by
no
means
subdued
,
and
with
a
smile
in
which
i
seemed
to
detect
suddenly
something
insolent
.
but
then
i
am
twenty
years
his
senior
.
youth
is
insolent
;
it
is
its
right
its
necessity
;
it
has
got
to
assert
itself
,
and
all
assertion
in
this
world
of
doubts
is
a
defiance
,
is
an
insolence
.
he
went
off
into
a
far
corner
,
and
coming
back
,
he
,
figuratively
speaking
,
turned
to
rend
me
.
i
spoke
like
that
because
i
even
i
,
who
had
been
no
end
kind
to
him
even
i
remembered
remembered
against
him
what
what
had
happened
.
and
what
about
others
the
the
world
?
where
'
s
the
wonder
he
wanted
to
get
out
,
meant
to
get
out
,
meant
to
stay
out
by
heavens
!
and
i
talked
about
proper
frames
of
mind
!
it
is
not
i
or
the
world
who
remember
,
i
shouted
.
it
is
you
you
,
who
remember
.
'
he
did
not
flinch
,
and
went
on
with
heat
,
forget
everything
,
everybody
,
everybody
.
his
voice
fell
but
you
,
he
added
.
yes
me
too
if
it
would
help
,
i
said
,
also
in
a
low
tone
.
after
this
we
remained
silent
and
languid
for
a
time
as
if
exhausted
.
then
he
began
again
,
composedly
,
and
told
me
that
mr
stein
had
instructed
him
to
wait
for
a
month
or
so
,
to
see
whether
it
was
possible
for
him
to
remain
,
before
he
began
building
a
new
house
for
himself
,
so
as
to
avoid
vain
expense
.
he
did
make
use
of
funny
expressions
stein
did
.
vain
expense
was
good
.
remain
?
why
!
of
course
.
he
would
hang
on
.
let
him
only
get
in
that
'
s
all
;
he
would
answer
for
it
he
would
remain
.
never
get
out
.
it
was
easy
enough
to
remain
.
do
not
be
foolhardy
,
i
said
,
rendered
uneasy
by
his
threatening
tone
.
if
you
only
live
long
enough
you
will
want
to
come
back
.
come
back
to
what
?
he
asked
absently
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
face
of
a
clock
on
the
wall
.
'
i
was
silent
for
a
while
.
is
it
to
be
never
,
then
?
i
said
.
never
,
he
repeated
dreamily
without
looking
at
me
,
and
then
flew
into
sudden
activity
.
jove
!
two
o
'
clock
,
and
i
sail
at
four
!
'
it
was
true
.
a
brigantine
of
stein
'
s
was
leaving
for
the
westward
that
afternoon
,
and
he
had
been
instructed
to
take
his
passage
in
her
,
only
no
orders
to
delay
the
sailing
had
been
given
.
i
suppose
stein
forgot
.
he
made
a
rush
to
get
his
things
while
i
went
aboard
my
ship
,
where
he
promised
to
call
on
his
way
to
the
outer
roadstead
.
he
turned
up
accordingly
in
a
great
hurry
and
with
a
small
leather
valise
in
his
hand
.
this
would
not
do
,
and
i
offered
him
an
old
tin
trunk
of
mine
supposed
to
be
water
-
tight
,
or
at
least
damp
-
tight
.
he
effected
the
transfer
by
the
simple
process
of
shooting
out
the
contents
of
his
valise
as
you
would
empty
a
sack
of
wheat
.
i
saw
three
books
in
the
tumble
;
two
small
,
in
dark
covers
,
and
a
thick
green
-
and
-
gold
volume
a
half
-
crown
complete
shakespeare
.
you
read
this
?
i
asked
.
yes
.
best
thing
to
cheer
up
a
fellow
,
he
said
hastily
.
i
was
struck
by
this
appreciation
,
but
there
was
no
time
for
shakespearian
talk
.
a
heavy
revolver
and
two
small
boxes
of
cartridges
were
lying
on
the
cuddy
-
table
.
pray
take
this
,
i
said
.
it
may
help
you
to
remain
.
no
sooner
were
these
words
out
of
my
mouth
than
i
perceived
what
grim
meaning
they
could
bear
.
may
help
you
to
get
in
,
i
corrected
myself
remorsefully
.
he
however
was
not
troubled
by
obscure
meanings
;
he
thanked
me
effusively
and
bolted
out
,
calling
good
-
bye
over
his
shoulder
.
i
heard
his
voice
through
the
ship
'
s
side
urging
his
boatmen
to
give
way
,
and
looking
out
of
the
stern
-
port
i
saw
the
boat
rounding
under
the
counter
.
he
sat
in
her
leaning
forward
,
exciting
his
men
with
voice
and
gestures
;
and
as
he
had
kept
the
revolver
in
his
hand
and
seemed
to
be
presenting
it
at
their
heads
,
i
shall
never
forget
the
scared
faces
of
the
four
javanese
,
and
the
frantic
swing
of
their
stroke
which
snatched
that
vision
from
under
my
eyes
.
then
turning
away
,
the
first
thing
i
saw
were
the
two
boxes
of
cartridges
on
the
cuddy
-
table
.
he
had
forgotten
to
take
them
.
'
i
ordered
my
gig
manned
at
once
;
but
jim
'
s
rowers
,
under
the
impression
that
their
lives
hung
on
a
thread
while
they
had
that
madman
in
the
boat
,
made
such
excellent
time
that
before
i
had
traversed
half
the
distance
between
the
two
vessels
i
caught
sight
of
him
clambering
over
the
rail
,
and
of
his
box
being
passed
up
.
all
the
brigantine
'
s
canvas
was
loose
,
her
mainsail
was
set
,
and
the
windlass
was
just
beginning
to
clink
as
i
stepped
upon
her
deck
:
her
master
,
a
dapper
little
half
-
caste
of
forty
or
so
,
in
a
blue
flannel
suit
,
with
lively
eyes
,
his
round
face
the
colour
of
lemon
-
peel
,
and
with
a
thin
little
black
moustache
drooping
on
each
side
of
his
thick
,
dark
lips
,
came
forward
smirking
.
he
turned
out
,
notwithstanding
his
self
-
satisfied
and
cheery
exterior
,
to
be
of
a
careworn
temperament
.
in
answer
to
a
remark
of
mine
(
while
jim
had
gone
below
for
a
moment
)
he
said
,
oh
yes
.
patusan
.
he
was
going
to
carry
the
gentleman
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
,
but
would
never
ascend
.
his
flowing
english
seemed
to
be
derived
from
a
dictionary
compiled
by
a
lunatic
.
had
mr
stein
desired
him
to
ascend
,
he
would
have
reverentially
(
i
think
he
wanted
to
say
respectfully
but
devil
only
knows
)
reverentially
made
objects
for
the
safety
of
properties
.
if
disregarded
,
he
would
have
presented
resignation
to
quit
.
twelve
months
ago
he
had
made
his
last
voyage
there
,
and
though
mr
cornelius
propitiated
many
offertories
to
mr
rajah
allang
and
the
principal
populations
,
on
conditions
which
made
the
trade
a
snare
and
ashes
in
the
mouth
,
yet
his
ship
had
been
fired
upon
from
the
woods
by
irresponsive
parties
all
the
way
down
the
river
;
which
causing
his
crew
from
exposure
to
limb
to
remain
silent
in
hidings
,
the
brigantine
was
nearly
stranded
on
a
sandbank
at
the
bar
,
where
she
would
have
been
perishable
beyond
the
act
of
man
.
the
angry
disgust
at
the
recollection
,
the
pride
of
his
fluency
,
to
which
he
turned
an
attentive
ear
,
struggled
for
the
possession
of
his
broad
simple
face
.
he
scowled
and
beamed
at
me
,
and
watched
with
satisfaction
the
undeniable
effect
of
his
phraseology
.
dark
frowns
ran
swiftly
over
the
placid
sea
,
and
the
brigantine
,
with
her
fore
-
topsail
to
the
mast
and
her
main
-
boom
amidships
,
seemed
bewildered
amongst
the
cat
'
s
-
paws
.
he
told
me
further
,
gnashing
his
teeth
,
that
the
rajah
was
a
laughable
hyaena
(
ca
not
imagine
how
he
got
hold
of
hyaenas
)
;
while
somebody
else
was
many
times
falser
than
the
weapons
of
a
crocodile
.
keeping
one
eye
on
the
movements
of
his
crew
forward
,
he
let
loose
his
volubility
comparing
the
place
to
a
cage
of
beasts
made
ravenous
by
long
impenitence
.
i
fancy
he
meant
impunity
.
he
had
no
intention
,
he
cried
,
to
exhibit
himself
to
be
made
attached
purposefully
to
robbery
.
the
long
-
drawn
wails
,
giving
the
time
for
the
pull
of
the
men
catting
the
anchor
,
came
to
an
end
,
and
he
lowered
his
voice
.
plenty
too
much
enough
of
patusan
,
he
concluded
,
with
energy
.
'
i
heard
afterwards
he
had
been
so
indiscreet
as
to
get
himself
tied
up
by
the
neck
with
a
rattan
halter
to
a
post
planted
in
the
middle
of
a
mud
-
hole
before
the
rajah
'
s
house
.
he
spent
the
best
part
of
a
day
and
a
whole
night
in
that
unwholesome
situation
,
but
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
the
thing
had
been
meant
as
a
sort
of
joke
.
he
brooded
for
a
while
over
that
horrid
memory
,
i
suppose
,
and
then
addressed
in
a
quarrelsome
tone
the
man
coming
aft
to
the
helm
.
when
he
turned
to
me
again
it
was
to
speak
judicially
,
without
passion
.
he
would
take
the
gentleman
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
at
batu
kring
(
patusan
town
being
situated
internally
,
he
remarked
,
thirty
miles
)
.
but
in
his
eyes
,
he
continued
a
tone
of
bored
,
weary
conviction
replacing
his
previous
voluble
delivery
the
gentleman
was
already
in
the
similitude
of
a
corpse
.
what
?
what
do
you
say
?
i
asked
.
he
assumed
a
startlingly
ferocious
demeanour
,
and
imitated
to
perfection
the
act
of
stabbing
from
behind
.
already
like
the
body
of
one
deported
,
he
explained
,
with
the
insufferably
conceited
air
of
his
kind
after
what
they
imagine
a
display
of
cleverness
.
behind
him
i
perceived
jim
smiling
silently
at
me
,
and
with
a
raised
hand
checking
the
exclamation
on
my
lips
.
'
then
,
while
the
half
-
caste
,
bursting
with
importance
,
shouted
his
orders
,
while
the
yards
swung
creaking
and
the
heavy
boom
came
surging
over
,
jim
and
i
,
alone
as
it
were
,
to
leeward
of
the
mainsail
,
clasped
each
other
'
s
hands
and
exchanged
the
last
hurried
words
.
my
heart
was
freed
from
that
dull
resentment
which
had
existed
side
by
side
with
interest
in
his
fate
.
the
absurd
chatter
of
the
half
-
caste
had
given
more
reality
to
the
miserable
dangers
of
his
path
than
stein
'
s
careful
statements
.
on
that
occasion
the
sort
of
formality
that
had
been
always
present
in
our
intercourse
vanished
from
our
speech
;
i
believe
i
called
him
dear
boy
,
and
he
tacked
on
the
words
old
man
to
some
half
-
uttered
expression
of
gratitude
,
as
though
his
risk
set
off
against
my
years
had
made
us
more
equal
in
age
and
in
feeling
.
there
was
a
moment
of
real
and
profound
intimacy
,
unexpected
and
short
-
lived
like
a
glimpse
of
some
everlasting
,
of
some
saving
truth
.
he
exerted
himself
to
soothe
me
as
though
he
had
been
the
more
mature
of
the
two
.
all
right
,
all
right
,
he
said
,
rapidly
,
and
with
feeling
.
i
promise
to
take
care
of
myself
.
yes
;
i
wo
not
take
any
risks
.
not
a
single
blessed
risk
.
of
course
not
.
i
mean
to
hang
out
.
do
not
you
worry
.
jove
!
i
feel
as
if
nothing
could
touch
me
.
why
!
this
is
luck
from
the
word
go
.
i
would
not
spoil
such
a
magnificent
chance
!
a
magnificent
chance
!
well
,
it
was
magnificent
,
but
chances
are
what
men
make
them
,
and
how
was
i
to
know
?
as
he
had
said
,
even
i
even
i
remembered
his
his
misfortune
against
him
.
it
was
true
.
and
the
best
thing
for
him
was
to
go
.
'
my
gig
had
dropped
in
the
wake
of
the
brigantine
,
and
i
saw
him
aft
detached
upon
the
light
of
the
westering
sun
,
raising
his
cap
high
above
his
head
.
i
heard
an
indistinct
shout
,
you
shall
hear
of
me
.
of
me
,
or
from
me
,
i
do
not
know
which
.
i
think
it
must
have
been
of
me
.
my
eyes
were
too
dazzled
by
the
glitter
of
the
sea
below
his
feet
to
see
him
clearly
;
i
am
fated
never
to
see
him
clearly
;
but
i
can
assure
you
no
man
could
have
appeared
less
in
the
similitude
of
a
corpse
,
as
that
half
-
caste
croaker
had
put
it
.
i
could
see
the
little
wretch
'
s
face
,
the
shape
and
colour
of
a
ripe
pumpkin
,
poked
out
somewhere
under
jim
'
s
elbow
.
he
,
too
,
raised
his
arm
as
if
for
a
downward
thrust
.
absit
omen
!
'
'
the
coast
of
patusan
(
i
saw
it
nearly
two
years
afterwards
)
is
straight
and
sombre
,
and
faces
a
misty
ocean
.
red
trails
are
seen
like
cataracts
of
rust
streaming
under
the
dark
-
green
foliage
of
bushes
and
creepers
clothing
the
low
cliffs
.
swampy
plains
open
out
at
the
mouth
of
rivers
,
with
a
view
of
jagged
blue
peaks
beyond
the
vast
forests
.
in
the
offing
a
chain
of
islands
,
dark
,
crumbling
shapes
,
stand
out
in
the
everlasting
sunlit
haze
like
the
remnants
of
a
wall
breached
by
the
sea
.
'
there
is
a
village
of
fisher
-
folk
at
the
mouth
of
the
batu
kring
branch
of
the
estuary
.
the
river
,
which
had
been
closed
so
long
,
was
open
then
,
and
stein
'
s
little
schooner
,
in
which
i
had
my
passage
,
worked
her
way
up
in
three
tides
without
being
exposed
to
a
fusillade
from
irresponsive
parties
.
such
a
state
of
affairs
belonged
already
to
ancient
history
,
if
i
could
believe
the
elderly
headman
of
the
fishing
village
,
who
came
on
board
to
act
as
a
sort
of
pilot
.
he
talked
to
me
(
the
second
white
man
he
had
ever
seen
)
with
confidence
,
and
most
of
his
talk
was
about
the
first
white
man
he
had
ever
seen
.
he
called
him
tuan
jim
,
and
the
tone
of
his
references
was
made
remarkable
by
a
strange
mixture
of
familiarity
and
awe
.
they
,
in
the
village
,
were
under
that
lord
'
s
special
protection
,
which
showed
that
jim
bore
no
grudge
.
if
he
had
warned
me
that
i
would
hear
of
him
it
was
perfectly
true
.
i
was
hearing
of
him
.
there
was
already
a
story
that
the
tide
had
turned
two
hours
before
its
time
to
help
him
on
his
journey
up
the
river
.
the
talkative
old
man
himself
had
steered
the
canoe
and
had
marvelled
at
the
phenomenon
.
moreover
,
all
the
glory
was
in
his
family
.
his
son
and
his
son
-
in
-
law
had
paddled
;
but
they
were
only
youths
without
experience
,
who
did
not
notice
the
speed
of
the
canoe
till
he
pointed
out
to
them
the
amazing
fact
.
'
jim
'
s
coming
to
that
fishing
village
was
a
blessing
;
but
to
them
,
as
to
many
of
us
,
the
blessing
came
heralded
by
terrors
.
so
many
generations
had
been
released
since
the
last
white
man
had
visited
the
river
that
the
very
tradition
had
been
lost
.
the
appearance
of
the
being
that
descended
upon
them
and
demanded
inflexibly
to
be
taken
up
to
patusan
was
discomposing
;
his
insistence
was
alarming
;
his
generosity
more
than
suspicious
.
it
was
an
unheard
-
of
request
.
there
was
no
precedent
.
what
would
the
rajah
say
to
this
?
what
would
he
do
to
them
?
the
best
part
of
the
night
was
spent
in
consultation
;
but
the
immediate
risk
from
the
anger
of
that
strange
man
seemed
so
great
that
at
last
a
cranky
dug
-
out
was
got
ready
.
the
women
shrieked
with
grief
as
it
put
off
.
a
fearless
old
hag
cursed
the
stranger
.
'
he
sat
in
it
,
as
i
'
ve
told
you
,
on
his
tin
box
,
nursing
the
unloaded
revolver
on
his
lap
.
he
sat
with
precaution
than
which
there
is
nothing
more
fatiguing
and
thus
entered
the
land
he
was
destined
to
fill
with
the
fame
of
his
virtues
,
from
the
blue
peaks
inland
to
the
white
ribbon
of
surf
on
the
coast
.
at
the
first
bend
he
lost
sight
of
the
sea
with
its
labouring
waves
for
ever
rising
,
sinking
,
and
vanishing
to
rise
again
the
very
image
of
struggling
mankind
and
faced
the
immovable
forests
rooted
deep
in
the
soil
,
soaring
towards
the
sunshine
,
everlasting
in
the
shadowy
might
of
their
tradition
,
like
life
itself
.
and
his
opportunity
sat
veiled
by
his
side
like
an
eastern
bride
waiting
to
be
uncovered
by
the
hand
of
the
master
.
he
too
was
the
heir
of
a
shadowy
and
mighty
tradition
!
he
told
me
,
however
,
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
felt
so
depressed
and
tired
as
in
that
canoe
.
all
the
movement
he
dared
to
allow
himself
was
to
reach
,
as
it
were
by
stealth
,
after
the
shell
of
half
a
cocoa
-
nut
floating
between
his
shoes
,
and
bale
some
of
the
water
out
with
a
carefully
restrained
action
.
he
discovered
how
hard
the
lid
of
a
block
-
tin
case
was
to
sit
upon
.
he
had
heroic
health
;
but
several
times
during
that
journey
he
experienced
fits
of
giddiness
,
and
between
whiles
he
speculated
hazily
as
to
the
size
of
the
blister
the
sun
was
raising
on
his
back
.
for
amusement
he
tried
by
looking
ahead
to
decide
whether
the
muddy
object
he
saw
lying
on
the
water
'
s
edge
was
a
log
of
wood
or
an
alligator
.
only
very
soon
he
had
to
give
that
up
.
no
fun
in
it
.
always
alligator
.
one
of
them
flopped
into
the
river
and
all
but
capsized
the
canoe
.
but
this
excitement
was
over
directly
.
then
in
a
long
empty
reach
he
was
very
grateful
to
a
troop
of
monkeys
who
came
right
down
on
the
bank
and
made
an
insulting
hullabaloo
on
his
passage
.
such
was
the
way
in
which
he
was
approaching
greatness
as
genuine
as
any
man
ever
achieved
.
principally
,
he
longed
for
sunset
;
and
meantime
his
three
paddlers
were
preparing
to
put
into
execution
their
plan
of
delivering
him
up
to
the
rajah
.
i
suppose
i
must
have
been
stupid
with
fatigue
,
or
perhaps
i
did
doze
off
for
a
time
,
he
said
.
the
first
thing
he
knew
was
his
canoe
coming
to
the
bank
.
he
became
instantaneously
aware
of
the
forest
having
been
left
behind
,
of
the
first
houses
being
visible
higher
up
,
of
a
stockade
on
his
left
,
and
of
his
boatmen
leaping
out
together
upon
a
low
point
of
land
and
taking
to
their
heels
.
instinctively
he
leaped
out
after
them
.
at
first
he
thought
himself
deserted
for
some
inconceivable
reason
,
but
he
heard
excited
shouts
,
a
gate
swung
open
,
and
a
lot
of
people
poured
out
,
making
towards
him
.
at
the
same
time
a
boat
full
of
armed
men
appeared
on
the
river
and
came
alongside
his
empty
canoe
,
thus
shutting
off
his
retreat
.
i
was
too
startled
to
be
quite
cool
do
not
you
know
?
and
if
that
revolver
had
been
loaded
i
would
have
shot
somebody
perhaps
two
,
three
bodies
,
and
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
me
.
but
it
wasn
'
t
.
why
not
?
i
asked
.
well
,
i
could
not
fight
the
whole
population
,
and
i
was
not
coming
to
them
as
if
i
were
afraid
of
my
life
,
he
said
,
with
just
a
faint
hint
of
his
stubborn
sulkiness
in
the
glance
he
gave
me
.
i
refrained
from
pointing
out
to
him
that
they
could
not
have
known
the
chambers
were
actually
empty
.
he
had
to
satisfy
himself
in
his
own
way
.
anyhow
it
wasn
'
t
,
he
repeated
good
-
humouredly
,
and
so
i
just
stood
still
and
asked
them
what
was
the
matter
.
that
seemed
to
strike
them
dumb
.
i
saw
some
of
these
thieves
going
off
with
my
box
.
that
long
-
legged
old
scoundrel
kassim
(
i
will
show
him
to
you
to
-
morrow
)
ran
out
fussing
to
me
about
the
rajah
wanting
to
see
me
.
i
said
,
'
all
right
.
'
i
too
wanted
to
see
the
rajah
,
and
i
simply
walked
in
through
the
gate
and
and
here
i
am
.
he
laughed
,
and
then
with
unexpected
emphasis
,
and
do
you
know
what
'
s
the
best
in
it
?
he
asked
.
i
will
tell
you
.
it
is
the
knowledge
that
had
i
been
wiped
out
it
is
this
place
that
would
have
been
the
loser
.
'
he
spoke
thus
to
me
before
his
house
on
that
evening
i
'
ve
mentioned
after
we
had
watched
the
moon
float
away
above
the
chasm
between
the
hills
like
an
ascending
spirit
out
of
a
grave
;
its
sheen
descended
,
cold
and
pale
,
like
the
ghost
of
dead
sunlight
.
there
is
something
haunting
in
the
light
of
the
moon
;
it
has
all
the
dispassionateness
of
a
disembodied
soul
,
and
something
of
its
inconceivable
mystery
.
it
is
to
our
sunshine
,
which
say
what
you
like
is
all
we
have
to
live
by
,
what
the
echo
is
to
the
sound
:
misleading
and
confusing
whether
the
note
be
mocking
or
sad
.
it
robs
all
forms
of
matter
which
,
after
all
,
is
our
domain
of
their
substance
,
and
gives
a
sinister
reality
to
shadows
alone
.
and
the
shadows
were
very
real
around
us
,
but
jim
by
my
side
looked
very
stalwart
,
as
though
nothing
not
even
the
occult
power
of
moonlight
could
rob
him
of
his
reality
in
my
eyes
.
perhaps
,
indeed
,
nothing
could
touch
him
since
he
had
survived
the
assault
of
the
dark
powers
.
all
was
silent
,
all
was
still
;
even
on
the
river
the
moonbeams
slept
as
on
a
pool
.
it
was
the
moment
of
high
water
,
a
moment
of
immobility
that
accentuated
the
utter
isolation
of
this
lost
corner
of
the
earth
.
the
houses
crowding
along
the
wide
shining
sweep
without
ripple
or
glitter
,
stepping
into
the
water
in
a
line
of
jostling
,
vague
,
grey
,
silvery
forms
mingled
with
black
masses
of
shadow
,
were
like
a
spectral
herd
of
shapeless
creatures
pressing
forward
to
drink
in
a
spectral
and
lifeless
stream
.
here
and
there
a
red
gleam
twinkled
within
the
bamboo
walls
,
warm
,
like
a
living
spark
,
significant
of
human
affections
,
of
shelter
,
of
repose
.
'
he
confessed
to
me
that
he
often
watched
these
tiny
warm
gleams
go
out
one
by
one
,
that
he
loved
to
see
people
go
to
sleep
under
his
eyes
,
confident
in
the
security
of
to
-
morrow
.
peaceful
here
,
eh
?
he
asked
.
he
was
not
eloquent
,
but
there
was
a
deep
meaning
in
the
words
that
followed
.
look
at
these
houses
;
there
'
s
not
one
where
i
am
not
trusted
.
jove
!
i
told
you
i
would
hang
on
.
ask
any
man
,
woman
,
or
child
he
paused
.
well
,
i
am
all
right
anyhow
.
'
i
observed
quickly
that
he
had
found
that
out
in
the
end
.
i
had
been
sure
of
it
,
i
added
.
he
shook
his
head
.
were
you
?
he
pressed
my
arm
lightly
above
the
elbow
.
well
,
then
you
were
right
.
'
there
was
elation
and
pride
,
there
was
awe
almost
,
in
that
low
exclamation
.
jove
!
he
cried
,
only
think
what
it
is
to
me
.
again
he
pressed
my
arm
.
and
you
asked
me
whether
i
thought
of
leaving
.
good
god
!
i
!
want
to
leave
!
especially
now
after
what
you
told
me
of
mr
stein
'
s
leave
!
why
!
that
'
s
what
i
was
afraid
of
.
it
would
have
been
it
would
have
been
harder
than
dying
.
no
on
my
word
.
do
not
laugh
.
i
must
feel
every
day
,
every
time
i
open
my
eyes
that
i
am
trusted
that
nobody
has
a
right
do
not
you
know
?
leave
!
for
where
?
what
for
?
to
get
what
?
'
i
had
told
him
(
indeed
it
was
the
main
object
of
my
visit
)
that
it
was
stein
'
s
intention
to
present
him
at
once
with
the
house
and
the
stock
of
trading
goods
,
on
certain
easy
conditions
which
would
make
the
transaction
perfectly
regular
and
valid
.
he
began
to
snort
and
plunge
at
first
.
confound
your
delicacy
!
i
shouted
.
it
is
not
stein
at
all
.
it
is
giving
you
what
you
had
made
for
yourself
.
and
in
any
case
keep
your
remarks
for
mcneil
when
you
meet
him
in
the
other
world
.
i
hope
it
wo
not
happen
soon
.
he
had
to
give
in
to
my
arguments
,
because
all
his
conquests
,
the
trust
,
the
fame
,
the
friendships
,
the
love
all
these
things
that
made
him
master
had
made
him
a
captive
,
too
.
he
looked
with
an
owner
'
s
eye
at
the
peace
of
the
evening
,
at
the
river
,
at
the
houses
,
at
the
everlasting
life
of
the
forests
,
at
the
life
of
the
old
mankind
,
at
the
secrets
of
the
land
,
at
the
pride
of
his
own
heart
;
but
it
was
they
that
possessed
him
and
made
him
their
own
to
the
innermost
thought
,
to
the
slightest
stir
of
blood
,
to
his
last
breath
.
'
it
was
something
to
be
proud
of
.
i
,
too
,
was
proud
for
him
,
if
not
so
certain
of
the
fabulous
value
of
the
bargain
.
it
was
wonderful
.
it
was
not
so
much
of
his
fearlessness
that
i
thought
.
it
is
strange
how
little
account
i
took
of
it
:
as
if
it
had
been
something
too
conventional
to
be
at
the
root
of
the
matter
.
no
.
i
was
more
struck
by
the
other
gifts
he
had
displayed
.
he
had
proved
his
grasp
of
the
unfamiliar
situation
,
his
intellectual
alertness
in
that
field
of
thought
.
there
was
his
readiness
,
too
!
amazing
.
and
all
this
had
come
to
him
in
a
manner
like
keen
scent
to
a
well
-
bred
hound
.
he
was
not
eloquent
,
but
there
was
a
dignity
in
this
constitutional
reticence
,
there
was
a
high
seriousness
in
his
stammerings
.
he
had
still
his
old
trick
of
stubborn
blushing
.
now
and
then
,
though
,
a
word
,
a
sentence
,
would
escape
him
that
showed
how
deeply
,
how
solemnly
,
he
felt
about
that
work
which
had
given
him
the
certitude
of
rehabilitation
.
that
is
why
he
seemed
to
love
the
land
and
the
people
with
a
sort
of
fierce
egoism
,
with
a
contemptuous
tenderness
.
'
this
is
where
i
was
prisoner
for
three
days
,
he
murmured
to
me
(
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
our
visit
to
the
rajah
)
,
while
we
were
making
our
way
slowly
through
a
kind
of
awestruck
riot
of
dependants
across
tunku
allang
'
s
courtyard
.
filthy
place
,
is
not
it
?
and
i
could
not
get
anything
to
eat
either
,
unless
i
made
a
row
about
it
,
and
then
it
was
only
a
small
plate
of
rice
and
a
fried
fish
not
much
bigger
than
a
stickleback
confound
them
!
jove
!
i
'
ve
been
hungry
prowling
inside
this
stinking
enclosure
with
some
of
these
vagabonds
shoving
their
mugs
right
under
my
nose
.
i
had
given
up
that
famous
revolver
of
yours
at
the
first
demand
.
glad
to
get
rid
of
the
bally
thing
.
look
like
a
fool
walking
about
with
an
empty
shooting
-
iron
in
my
hand
.
at
that
moment
we
came
into
the
presence
,
and
he
became
unflinchingly
grave
and
complimentary
with
his
late
captor
.
oh
!
magnificent
!
i
want
to
laugh
when
i
think
of
it
.
but
i
was
impressed
,
too
.
the
old
disreputable
tunku
allang
could
not
help
showing
his
fear
(
he
was
no
hero
,
for
all
the
tales
of
his
hot
youth
he
was
fond
of
telling
)
;
and
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
wistful
confidence
in
his
manner
towards
his
late
prisoner
.
note
!
even
where
he
would
be
most
hated
he
was
still
trusted
.
jim
as
far
as
i
could
follow
the
conversation
was
improving
the
occasion
by
the
delivery
of
a
lecture
.
some
poor
villagers
had
been
waylaid
and
robbed
while
on
their
way
to
doramin
'
s
house
with
a
few
pieces
of
gum
or
beeswax
which
they
wished
to
exchange
