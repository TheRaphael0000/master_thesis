after
two
years
of
training
he
went
to
sea
,
and
entering
the
regions
so
well
known
to
his
imagination
,
found
them
strangely
barren
of
adventure
.
he
made
many
voyages
.
he
knew
the
magic
monotony
of
existence
between
sky
and
water
:
he
had
to
bear
the
criticism
of
men
,
the
exactions
of
the
sea
,
and
the
prosaic
severity
of
the
daily
task
that
gives
bread
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
whose
only
reward
is
in
the
perfect
love
of
the
work
.
this
reward
eluded
him
.
yet
he
could
not
go
back
,
because
there
is
nothing
more
enticing
,
disenchanting
,
and
enslaving
than
the
life
at
sea
.
besides
,
his
prospects
were
good
.
he
was
gentlemanly
,
steady
,
tractable
,
with
a
thorough
knowledge
of
his
duties
;
and
in
time
,
when
yet
very
young
,
he
became
chief
mate
of
a
fine
ship
,
without
ever
having
been
tested
by
those
events
of
the
sea
that
show
in
the
light
of
day
the
inner
worth
of
a
man
,
the
edge
of
his
temper
,
and
the
fibre
of
his
stuff
;
that
reveal
the
quality
of
his
resistance
and
the
secret
truth
of
his
pretences
,
not
only
to
others
but
also
to
himself
.
only
once
in
all
that
time
he
had
again
a
glimpse
of
the
earnestness
in
the
anger
of
the
sea
.
that
truth
is
not
so
often
made
apparent
as
people
might
think
.
there
are
many
shades
in
the
danger
of
adventures
and
gales
,
and
it
is
only
now
and
then
that
there
appears
on
the
face
of
facts
a
sinister
violence
of
intention
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
indefinable
something
which
forces
it
upon
the
mind
and
the
heart
of
a
man
,
that
this
complication
of
accidents
or
these
elemental
furies
are
coming
at
him
with
a
purpose
of
malice
,
with
a
strength
beyond
control
,
with
an
unbridled
cruelty
that
means
to
tear
out
of
him
his
hope
and
his
fear
,
the
pain
of
his
fatigue
and
his
longing
for
rest
:
which
means
to
smash
,
to
destroy
,
to
annihilate
all
he
has
seen
,
known
,
loved
,
enjoyed
,
or
hated
;
all
that
is
priceless
and
necessary
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
sunshine
,
the
memories
,
the
future
;
which
means
to
sweep
the
whole
precious
world
utterly
away
from
his
sight
by
the
simple
and
appalling
act
of
taking
his
life
.
jim
,
disabled
by
a
falling
spar
at
the
beginning
of
a
week
of
which
his
scottish
captain
used
to
say
afterwards
,
'
man
!
it
is
a
pairfect
meeracle
to
me
how
she
lived
through
it
!
'
spent
many
days
stretched
on
his
back
,
dazed
,
battered
,
hopeless
,
and
tormented
as
if
at
the
bottom
of
an
abyss
of
unrest
.
he
did
not
care
what
the
end
would
be
,
and
in
his
lucid
moments
overvalued
his
indifference
.
the
danger
,
when
not
seen
,
has
the
imperfect
vagueness
of
human
thought
.
the
fear
grows
shadowy
;
and
imagination
,
the
enemy
of
men
,
the
father
of
all
terrors
,
unstimulated
,
sinks
to
rest
in
the
dullness
of
exhausted
emotion
.
jim
saw
nothing
but
the
disorder
of
his
tossed
cabin
.
he
lay
there
battened
down
in
the
midst
of
a
small
devastation
,
and
felt
secretly
glad
he
had
not
to
go
on
deck
.
but
now
and
again
an
uncontrollable
rush
of
anguish
would
grip
him
bodily
,
make
him
gasp
and
writhe
under
the
blankets
,
and
then
the
unintelligent
brutality
of
an
existence
liable
to
the
agony
of
such
sensations
filled
him
with
a
despairing
desire
to
escape
at
any
cost
.
then
fine
weather
returned
,
and
he
thought
no
more
about
it
.
his
lameness
,
however
,
persisted
,
and
when
the
ship
arrived
at
an
eastern
port
he
had
to
go
to
the
hospital
.
his
recovery
was
slow
,
and
he
was
left
behind
.
there
were
only
two
other
patients
in
the
white
men
'
s
ward
:
the
purser
of
a
gunboat
,
who
had
broken
his
leg
falling
down
a
hatchway
;
and
a
kind
of
railway
contractor
from
a
neighbouring
province
,
afflicted
by
some
mysterious
tropical
disease
,
who
held
the
doctor
for
an
ass
,
and
indulged
in
secret
debaucheries
of
patent
medicine
which
his
tamil
servant
used
to
smuggle
in
with
unwearied
devotion
.
they
told
each
other
the
story
of
their
lives
,
played
cards
a
little
,
or
,
yawning
and
in
pyjamas
,
lounged
through
the
day
in
easy
-
chairs
without
saying
a
word
.
the
hospital
stood
on
a
hill
,
and
a
gentle
breeze
entering
through
the
windows
,
always
flung
wide
open
,
brought
into
the
bare
room
the
softness
of
the
sky
,
the
languor
of
the
earth
,
the
bewitching
breath
of
the
eastern
waters
.
there
were
perfumes
in
it
,
suggestions
of
infinite
repose
,
the
gift
of
endless
dreams
.
jim
looked
every
day
over
the
thickets
of
gardens
,
beyond
the
roofs
of
the
town
,
over
the
fronds
of
palms
growing
on
the
shore
,
at
that
roadstead
which
is
a
thoroughfare
to
the
east
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
at
the
roadstead
dotted
by
garlanded
islets
,
lighted
by
festal
sunshine
,
its
ships
like
toys
,
its
brilliant
activity
resembling
a
holiday
pageant
,
with
the
eternal
serenity
of
the
eastern
sky
overhead
and
the
smiling
peace
of
the
eastern
seas
possessing
the
space
as
far
as
the
horizon
.
directly
he
could
walk
without
a
stick
,
he
descended
into
the
town
to
look
for
some
opportunity
to
get
home
.
nothing
offered
just
then
,
and
,
while
waiting
,
he
associated
naturally
with
the
men
of
his
calling
in
the
port
.
these
were
of
two
kinds
.
some
,
very
few
and
seen
there
but
seldom
,
led
mysterious
lives
,
had
preserved
an
undefaced
energy
with
the
temper
of
buccaneers
and
the
eyes
of
dreamers
.
they
appeared
to
live
in
a
crazy
maze
of
plans
,
hopes
,
dangers
,
enterprises
,
ahead
of
civilisation
,
in
the
dark
places
of
the
sea
;
and
their
death
was
the
only
event
of
their
fantastic
existence
that
seemed
to
have
a
reasonable
certitude
of
achievement
.
the
majority
were
men
who
,
like
himself
,
thrown
there
by
some
accident
,
had
remained
as
officers
of
country
ships
.
they
had
now
a
horror
of
the
home
service
,
with
its
harder
conditions
,
severer
view
of
duty
,
and
the
hazard
of
stormy
oceans
.
they
were
attuned
to
the
eternal
peace
of
eastern
sky
and
sea
.
they
loved
short
passages
,
good
deck
-
chairs
,
large
native
crews
,
and
the
distinction
of
being
white
.
they
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
hard
work
,
and
led
precariously
easy
lives
,
always
on
the
verge
of
dismissal
,
always
on
the
verge
of
engagement
,
serving
chinamen
,
arabs
,
half
-
castes
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
would
have
served
the
devil
himself
had
he
made
it
easy
enough
.
they
talked
everlastingly
of
turns
of
luck
:
how
so
-
and
-
so
got
charge
of
a
boat
on
the
coast
of
china
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
soft
thing
;
how
this
one
had
an
easy
billet
in
japan
somewhere
,
and
that
one
was
doing
well
in
the
siamese
navy
;
and
in
all
they
said
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
their
actions
,
in
their
looks
,
in
their
persons
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
could
be
detected
the
soft
spot
,
the
place
of
decay
,
the
determination
to
lounge
safely
through
existence
.
to
jim
that
gossiping
crowd
,
viewed
as
seamen
,
seemed
at
first
more
unsubstantial
than
so
many
shadows
.
but
at
length
he
found
a
fascination
in
the
sight
of
those
men
,
in
their
appearance
of
doing
so
well
on
such
a
small
allowance
of
danger
and
toil
.
in
time
,
beside
the
original
disdain
there
grew
up
slowly
another
sentiment
;
and
suddenly
,
giving
up
the
idea
of
going
home
,
he
took
a
berth
as
chief
mate
of
the
patna
.
the
patna
was
a
local
steamer
as
old
as
the
hills
,
lean
like
a
greyhound
,
and
eaten
up
with
rust
worse
than
a
condemned
water
-
tank
.
she
was
owned
by
a
chinaman
,
chartered
by
an
arab
,
and
commanded
by
a
sort
of
renegade
new
south
wales
german
,
very
anxious
to
curse
publicly
his
native
country
,
but
who
,
apparently
on
the
strength
of
bismarck
'
s
victorious
policy
,
brutalised
all
those
he
was
not
afraid
of
,
and
wore
a
'
blood
-
and
-
iron
'
air
,
'
combined
with
a
purple
nose
and
a
red
moustache
.
after
she
had
been
painted
outside
and
whitewashed
inside
,
eight
hundred
pilgrims
(
more
or
less
)
were
driven
on
board
of
her
as
she
lay
with
steam
up
alongside
a
wooden
jetty
.
they
streamed
aboard
over
three
gangways
,
they
streamed
in
urged
by
faith
and
the
hope
of
paradise
,
they
streamed
in
with
a
continuous
tramp
and
shuffle
of
bare
feet
,
without
a
word
,
a
murmur
,
or
a
look
back
;
and
when
clear
of
confining
rails
spread
on
all
sides
over
the
deck
,
flowed
forward
and
aft
,
overflowed
down
the
yawning
hatchways
,
filled
the
inner
recesses
of
the
ship
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
like
water
filling
a
cistern
,
like
water
flowing
into
crevices
and
crannies
,
like
water
rising
silently
even
with
the
rim
.
eight
hundred
men
and
women
with
faith
and
hopes
,
with
affections
and
memories
,
they
had
collected
there
,
coming
from
north
and
south
and
from
the
outskirts
of
the
east
,
after
treading
the
jungle
paths
,
descending
the
rivers
,
coasting
in
praus
along
the
shallows
,
crossing
in
small
canoes
from
island
to
island
,
passing
through
suffering
,
meeting
strange
sights
,
beset
by
strange
fears
,
upheld
by
one
desire
.
they
came
from
solitary
huts
in
the
wilderness
,
from
populous
campongs
,
from
villages
by
the
sea
.
at
the
call
of
an
idea
they
had
left
their
forests
,
their
clearings
,
the
protection
of
their
rulers
,
their
prosperity
,
their
poverty
,
the
surroundings
of
their
youth
and
the
graves
of
their
fathers
.
they
came
covered
with
dust
,
with
sweat
,
with
grime
,
with
rags
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
strong
men
at
the
head
of
family
parties
,
the
lean
old
men
pressing
forward
without
hope
of
return
;
young
boys
with
fearless
eyes
glancing
curiously
,
shy
little
girls
with
tumbled
long
hair
;
the
timid
women
muffled
up
and
clasping
to
their
breasts
,
wrapped
in
loose
ends
of
soiled
head
-
cloths
,
their
sleeping
babies
,
the
unconscious
pilgrims
of
an
exacting
belief
.
'
look
at
dese
cattle
,
'
said
the
german
skipper
to
his
new
chief
mate
.
an
arab
,
the
leader
of
that
pious
voyage
,
came
last
.
he
walked
slowly
aboard
,
handsome
and
grave
in
his
white
gown
and
large
turban
.
a
string
of
servants
followed
,
loaded
with
his
luggage
;
the
patna
cast
off
and
backed
away
from
the
wharf
.
she
was
headed
between
two
small
islets
,
crossed
obliquely
the
anchoring
-
ground
of
sailing
-
ships
,
swung
through
half
a
circle
in
the
shadow
of
a
hill
,
then
ranged
close
to
a
ledge
of
foaming
reefs
.
the
arab
,
standing
up
aft
,
recited
aloud
the
prayer
of
travellers
by
sea
.
he
invoked
the
favour
of
the
most
high
upon
that
journey
,
implored
his
blessing
on
men
'
s
toil
and
on
the
secret
purposes
of
their
hearts
;
the
steamer
pounded
in
the
dusk
the
calm
water
of
the
strait
;
and
far
astern
of
the
pilgrim
ship
a
screw
-
pile
lighthouse
,
planted
by
unbelievers
on
a
treacherous
shoal
,
seemed
to
wink
at
her
its
eye
of
flame
,
as
if
in
derision
of
her
errand
of
faith
.
she
cleared
the
strait
,
crossed
the
bay
,
continued
on
her
way
through
the
'
one
-
degree
'
passage
.
she
held
on
straight
for
the
red
sea
under
a
serene
sky
,
under
a
sky
scorching
and
unclouded
,
enveloped
in
a
fulgor
of
sunshine
that
killed
all
thought
,
oppressed
the
heart
,
withered
all
impulses
of
strength
and
energy
.
and
under
the
sinister
splendour
of
that
sky
the
sea
,
blue
and
profound
,
remained
still
,
without
a
stir
,
without
a
ripple
,
without
a
wrinkle
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
viscous
,
stagnant
,
dead
.
the
patna
,
with
a
slight
hiss
,
passed
over
that
plain
,
luminous
and
smooth
,
unrolled
a
black
ribbon
of
smoke
across
the
sky
,
left
behind
her
on
the
water
a
white
ribbon
of
foam
that
vanished
at
once
,
like
the
phantom
of
a
track
drawn
upon
a
lifeless
sea
by
the
phantom
of
a
steamer
.
every
morning
the
sun
,
as
if
keeping
pace
in
his
revolutions
with
the
progress
of
the
pilgrimage
,
emerged
with
a
silent
burst
of
light
exactly
at
the
same
distance
astern
of
the
ship
,
caught
up
with
her
at
noon
,
pouring
the
concentrated
fire
of
his
rays
on
the
pious
purposes
of
the
men
,
glided
past
on
his
descent
,
and
sank
mysteriously
into
the
sea
evening
after
evening
,
preserving
the
same
distance
ahead
of
her
advancing
bows
.
the
five
whites
on
board
lived
amidships
,
isolated
from
the
human
cargo
.
the
awnings
covered
the
deck
with
a
white
roof
from
stem
to
stern
,
and
a
faint
hum
,
a
low
murmur
of
sad
voices
,
alone
revealed
the
presence
of
a
crowd
of
people
upon
the
great
blaze
of
the
ocean
.
such
were
the
days
,
still
,
hot
,
heavy
,
disappearing
one
by
one
into
the
past
,
as
if
falling
into
an
abyss
for
ever
open
in
the
wake
of
the
ship
;
and
the
ship
,
lonely
under
a
wisp
of
smoke
,
held
on
her
steadfast
way
black
and
smouldering
in
a
luminous
immensity
,
as
if
scorched
by
a
flame
flicked
at
her
from
a
heaven
without
pity
.
the
nights
descended
on
her
like
a
benediction
.
a
marvellous
stillness
pervaded
the
world
,
and
the
stars
,
together
with
the
serenity
of
their
rays
,
seemed
to
shed
upon
the
earth
the
assurance
of
everlasting
security
.
the
young
moon
recurved
,
and
shining
low
in
the
west
,
was
like
a
slender
shaving
thrown
up
from
a
bar
of
gold
,
and
the
arabian
sea
,
smooth
and
cool
to
the
eye
like
a
sheet
of
ice
,
extended
its
perfect
level
to
the
perfect
circle
of
a
dark
horizon
.
the
propeller
turned
without
a
check
,
as
though
its
beat
had
been
part
of
the
scheme
of
a
safe
universe
;
and
on
each
side
of
the
patna
two
deep
folds
of
water
,
permanent
and
sombre
on
the
unwrinkled
shimmer
,
enclosed
within
their
straight
and
diverging
ridges
a
few
white
swirls
of
foam
bursting
in
a
low
hiss
,
a
few
wavelets
,
a
few
ripples
,
a
few
undulations
that
,
left
behind
,
agitated
the
surface
of
the
sea
for
an
instant
after
the
passage
of
the
ship
,
subsided
splashing
gently
,
calmed
down
at
last
into
the
circular
stillness
of
water
and
sky
with
the
black
speck
of
the
moving
hull
remaining
everlastingly
in
its
centre
.
jim
on
the
bridge
was
penetrated
by
the
great
certitude
of
unbounded
safety
and
peace
that
could
be
read
on
the
silent
aspect
of
nature
like
the
certitude
of
fostering
love
upon
the
placid
tenderness
of
a
mother
'
s
face
.
below
the
roof
of
awnings
,
surrendered
to
the
wisdom
of
white
men
and
to
their
courage
,
trusting
the
power
of
their
unbelief
and
the
iron
shell
of
their
fire
-
ship
,
the
pilgrims
of
an
exacting
faith
slept
on
mats
,
on
blankets
,
on
bare
planks
,
on
every
deck
,
in
all
the
dark
corners
,
wrapped
in
dyed
cloths
,
muffled
in
soiled
rags
,
with
their
heads
resting
on
small
bundles
,
with
their
faces
pressed
to
bent
forearms
:
the
men
,
the
women
,
the
children
;
the
old
with
the
young
,
the
decrepit
with
the
lusty
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
all
equal
before
sleep
,
death
'
s
brother
.
a
draught
of
air
,
fanned
from
forward
by
the
speed
of
the
ship
,
passed
steadily
through
the
long
gloom
between
the
high
bulwarks
,
swept
over
the
rows
of
prone
bodies
;
a
few
dim
flames
in
globe
-
lamps
were
hung
short
here
and
there
under
the
ridge
-
poles
,
and
in
the
blurred
circles
of
light
thrown
down
and
trembling
slightly
to
the
unceasing
vibration
of
the
ship
appeared
a
chin
upturned
,
two
closed
eyelids
,
a
dark
hand
with
silver
rings
,
a
meagre
limb
draped
in
a
torn
covering
,
a
head
bent
back
,
a
naked
foot
,
a
throat
bared
and
stretched
as
if
offering
itself
to
the
knife
.
the
well
-
to
-
do
had
made
for
their
families
shelters
with
heavy
boxes
and
dusty
mats
;
the
poor
reposed
side
by
side
with
all
they
had
on
earth
tied
up
in
a
rag
under
their
heads
;
the
lone
old
men
slept
,
with
drawn
-
up
legs
,
upon
their
prayer
-
carpets
,
with
their
hands
over
their
ears
and
one
elbow
on
each
side
of
the
face
;
a
father
,
his
shoulders
up
and
his
knees
under
his
forehead
,
dozed
dejectedly
by
a
boy
who
slept
on
his
back
with
tousled
hair
and
one
arm
commandingly
extended
;
a
woman
covered
from
head
to
foot
,
like
a
corpse
,
with
a
piece
of
white
sheeting
,
had
a
naked
child
in
the
hollow
of
each
arm
;
the
arab
'
s
belongings
,
piled
right
aft
,
made
a
heavy
mound
of
broken
outlines
,
with
a
cargo
-
lamp
swung
above
,
and
a
great
confusion
of
vague
forms
behind
:
gleams
of
paunchy
brass
pots
,
the
foot
-
rest
of
a
deck
-
chair
,
blades
of
spears
,
the
straight
scabbard
of
an
old
sword
leaning
against
a
heap
of
pillows
,
the
spout
of
a
tin
coffee
-
pot
.
the
patent
log
on
the
taffrail
periodically
rang
a
single
tinkling
stroke
for
every
mile
traversed
on
an
errand
of
faith
.
above
the
mass
of
sleepers
a
faint
and
patient
sigh
at
times
floated
,
the
exhalation
of
a
troubled
dream
;
and
short
metallic
clangs
bursting
out
suddenly
in
the
depths
of
the
ship
,
the
harsh
scrape
of
a
shovel
,
the
violent
slam
of
a
furnace
-
door
,
exploded
brutally
,
as
if
the
men
handling
the
mysterious
things
below
had
their
breasts
full
of
fierce
anger
:
while
the
slim
high
hull
of
the
steamer
went
on
evenly
ahead
,
without
a
sway
of
her
bare
masts
,
cleaving
continuously
the
great
calm
of
the
waters
under
the
inaccessible
serenity
of
the
sky
.
jim
paced
athwart
,
and
his
footsteps
in
the
vast
silence
were
loud
to
his
own
ears
,
as
if
echoed
by
the
watchful
stars
:
his
eyes
,
roaming
about
the
line
of
the
horizon
,
seemed
to
gaze
hungrily
into
the
unattainable
,
and
did
not
see
the
shadow
of
the
coming
event
.
the
only
shadow
on
the
sea
was
the
shadow
of
the
black
smoke
pouring
heavily
from
the
funnel
its
immense
streamer
,
whose
end
was
constantly
dissolving
in
the
air
.
two
malays
,
silent
and
almost
motionless
,
steered
,
one
on
each
side
of
the
wheel
,
whose
brass
rim
shone
fragmentarily
in
the
oval
of
light
thrown
out
by
the
binnacle
.
now
and
then
a
hand
,
with
black
fingers
alternately
letting
go
and
catching
hold
of
revolving
spokes
,
appeared
in
the
illumined
part
;
the
links
of
wheel
-
chains
ground
heavily
in
the
grooves
of
the
barrel
.
jim
would
glance
at
the
compass
,
would
glance
around
the
unattainable
horizon
,
would
stretch
himself
till
his
joints
cracked
,
with
a
leisurely
twist
of
the
body
,
in
the
very
excess
of
well
-
being
;
and
,
as
if
made
audacious
by
the
invincible
aspect
of
the
peace
,
he
felt
he
cared
for
nothing
that
could
happen
to
him
to
the
end
of
his
days
.
from
time
to
time
he
glanced
idly
at
a
chart
pegged
out
with
four
drawing
-
pins
on
a
low
three
-
legged
table
abaft
the
steering
-
gear
case
.
the
sheet
of
paper
portraying
the
depths
of
the
sea
presented
a
shiny
surface
under
the
light
of
a
bull
'
s
-
eye
lamp
lashed
to
a
stanchion
,
a
surface
as
level
and
smooth
as
the
glimmering
surface
of
the
waters
.
parallel
rulers
with
a
pair
of
dividers
reposed
on
it
;
the
ship
'
s
position
at
last
noon
was
marked
with
a
small
black
cross
,
and
the
straight
pencil
-
line
drawn
firmly
as
far
as
perim
figured
the
course
of
the
ship
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
path
of
souls
towards
the
holy
place
,
the
promise
of
salvation
,
the
reward
of
eternal
life
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
while
the
pencil
with
its
sharp
end
touching
the
somali
coast
lay
round
and
still
like
a
naked
ship
'
s
spar
floating
in
the
pool
of
a
sheltered
dock
.
'
how
steady
she
goes
,
'
thought
jim
with
wonder
,
with
something
like
gratitude
for
this
high
peace
of
sea
and
sky
.
at
such
times
his
thoughts
would
be
full
of
valorous
deeds
:
he
loved
these
dreams
and
the
success
of
his
imaginary
achievements
.
they
were
the
best
parts
of
life
,
its
secret
truth
,
its
hidden
reality
.
they
had
a
gorgeous
virility
,
the
charm
of
vagueness
,
they
passed
before
him
with
an
heroic
tread
;
they
carried
his
soul
away
with
them
and
made
it
drunk
with
the
divine
philtre
of
an
unbounded
confidence
in
itself
.
there
was
nothing
he
could
not
face
.
he
was
so
pleased
with
the
idea
that
he
smiled
,
keeping
perfunctorily
his
eyes
ahead
;
and
when
he
happened
to
glance
back
he
saw
the
white
streak
of
the
wake
drawn
as
straight
by
the
ship
'
s
keel
upon
the
sea
as
the
black
line
drawn
by
the
pencil
upon
the
chart
.
the
ash
-
buckets
racketed
,
clanking
up
and
down
the
stoke
-
hold
ventilators
,
and
this
tin
-
pot
clatter
warned
him
the
end
of
his
watch
was
near
.
he
sighed
with
content
,
with
regret
as
well
at
having
to
part
from
that
serenity
which
fostered
the
adventurous
freedom
of
his
thoughts
.
he
was
a
little
sleepy
too
,
and
felt
a
pleasurable
languor
running
through
every
limb
as
though
all
the
blood
in
his
body
had
turned
to
warm
milk
.
his
skipper
had
come
up
noiselessly
,
in
pyjamas
and
with
his
sleeping
-
jacket
flung
wide
open
.
red
of
face
,
only
half
awake
,
the
left
eye
partly
closed
,
the
right
staring
stupid
and
glassy
,
he
hung
his
big
head
over
the
chart
and
scratched
his
ribs
sleepily
.
there
was
something
obscene
in
the
sight
of
his
naked
flesh
.
his
bared
breast
glistened
soft
and
greasy
as
though
he
had
sweated
out
his
fat
in
his
sleep
.
he
pronounced
a
professional
remark
in
a
voice
harsh
and
dead
,
resembling
the
rasping
sound
of
a
wood
-
file
on
the
edge
of
a
plank
;
the
fold
of
his
double
chin
hung
like
a
bag
triced
up
close
under
the
hinge
of
his
jaw
.
jim
started
,
and
his
answer
was
full
of
deference
;
but
the
odious
and
fleshy
figure
,
as
though
seen
for
the
first
time
in
a
revealing
moment
,
fixed
itself
in
his
memory
for
ever
as
the
incarnation
of
everything
vile
and
base
that
lurks
in
the
world
we
love
:
in
our
own
hearts
we
trust
for
our
salvation
,
in
the
men
that
surround
us
,
in
the
sights
that
fill
our
eyes
,
in
the
sounds
that
fill
our
ears
,
and
in
the
air
that
fills
our
lungs
.
the
thin
gold
shaving
of
the
moon
floating
slowly
downwards
had
lost
itself
on
the
darkened
surface
of
the
waters
,
and
the
eternity
beyond
the
sky
seemed
to
come
down
nearer
to
the
earth
,
with
the
augmented
glitter
of
the
stars
,
with
the
more
profound
sombreness
in
the
lustre
of
the
half
-
transparent
dome
covering
the
flat
disc
of
an
opaque
sea
.
the
ship
moved
so
smoothly
that
her
onward
motion
was
imperceptible
to
the
senses
of
men
,
as
though
she
had
been
a
crowded
planet
speeding
through
the
dark
spaces
of
ether
behind
the
swarm
of
suns
,
in
the
appalling
and
calm
solitudes
awaiting
the
breath
of
future
creations
.
'
hot
is
no
name
for
it
down
below
,
'
said
a
voice
.
jim
smiled
without
looking
round
.
the
skipper
presented
an
unmoved
breadth
of
back
:
it
was
the
renegade
'
s
trick
to
appear
pointedly
unaware
of
your
existence
unless
it
suited
his
purpose
to
turn
at
you
with
a
devouring
glare
before
he
let
loose
a
torrent
of
foamy
,
abusive
jargon
that
came
like
a
gush
from
a
sewer
.
now
he
emitted
only
a
sulky
grunt
;
the
second
engineer
at
the
head
of
the
bridge
-
ladder
,
kneading
with
damp
palms
a
dirty
sweat
-
rag
,
unabashed
,
continued
the
tale
of
his
complaints
.
the
sailors
had
a
good
time
of
it
up
here
,
and
what
was
the
use
of
them
in
the
world
he
would
be
blowed
if
he
could
see
.
the
poor
devils
of
engineers
had
to
get
the
ship
along
anyhow
,
and
they
could
very
well
do
the
rest
too
;
by
gosh
they
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
'
shut
up
!
'
growled
the
german
stolidly
.
'
oh
yes
!
shut
up
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
when
anything
goes
wrong
you
fly
to
us
,
do
not
you
?
'
went
on
the
other
.
he
was
more
than
half
cooked
,
he
expected
;
but
anyway
,
now
,
he
did
not
mind
how
much
he
sinned
,
because
these
last
three
days
he
had
passed
through
a
fine
course
of
training
for
the
place
where
the
bad
boys
go
when
they
die
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
b
'
gosh
,
he
had
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
besides
being
made
jolly
well
deaf
by
the
blasted
racket
below
.
the
durned
,
compound
,
surface
-
condensing
,
rotten
scrap
-
heap
rattled
and
banged
down
there
like
an
old
deck
-
winch
,
only
more
so
;
and
what
made
him
risk
his
life
every
night
and
day
that
god
made
amongst
the
refuse
of
a
breaking
-
up
yard
flying
round
at
fifty
-
seven
revolutions
,
was
more
than
he
could
tell
.
he
must
have
been
born
reckless
,
b
'
gosh
.
he
.
.
.
'
where
did
you
get
drink
?
'
inquired
the
german
,
very
savage
;
but
motionless
in
the
light
of
the
binnacle
,
like
a
clumsy
effigy
of
a
man
cut
out
of
a
block
of
fat
.
jim
went
on
smiling
at
the
retreating
horizon
;
his
heart
was
full
of
generous
impulses
,
and
his
thought
was
contemplating
his
own
superiority
.
'
drink
!
'
repeated
the
engineer
with
amiable
scorn
:
he
was
hanging
on
with
both
hands
to
the
rail
,
a
shadowy
figure
with
flexible
legs
.
'
not
from
you
,
captain
.
you
are
far
too
mean
,
b
'
gosh
.
you
would
let
a
good
man
die
sooner
than
give
him
a
drop
of
schnapps
.
that
'
s
what
you
germans
call
economy
.
penny
wise
,
pound
foolish
.
'
he
became
sentimental
.
the
chief
had
given
him
a
four
-
finger
nip
about
ten
o
'
clock
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
'
only
one
,
s
'
elp
me
!
'
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
good
old
chief
;
but
as
to
getting
the
old
fraud
out
of
his
bunk
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
five
-
ton
crane
could
not
do
it
.
not
it
.
not
to
-
night
anyhow
.
he
was
sleeping
sweetly
like
a
little
child
,
with
a
bottle
of
prime
brandy
under
his
pillow
.
from
the
thick
throat
of
the
commander
of
the
patna
came
a
low
rumble
,
on
which
the
sound
of
the
word
schwein
fluttered
high
and
low
like
a
capricious
feather
in
a
faint
stir
of
air
.
he
and
the
chief
engineer
had
been
cronies
for
a
good
few
years
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
serving
the
same
jovial
,
crafty
,
old
chinaman
,
with
horn
-
rimmed
goggles
and
strings
of
red
silk
plaited
into
the
venerable
grey
hairs
of
his
pigtail
.
the
quay
-
side
opinion
in
the
patna
'
s
home
-
port
was
that
these
two
in
the
way
of
brazen
peculation
'
had
done
together
pretty
well
everything
you
can
think
of
.
'
outwardly
they
were
badly
matched
:
one
dull
-
eyed
,
malevolent
,
and
of
soft
fleshy
curves
;
the
other
lean
,
all
hollows
,
with
a
head
long
and
bony
like
the
head
of
an
old
horse
,
with
sunken
cheeks
,
with
sunken
temples
,
with
an
indifferent
glazed
glance
of
sunken
eyes
.
he
had
been
stranded
out
east
somewhere
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
canton
,
in
shanghai
,
or
perhaps
in
yokohama
;
he
probably
did
not
care
to
remember
himself
the
exact
locality
,
nor
yet
the
cause
of
his
shipwreck
.
he
had
been
,
in
mercy
to
his
youth
,
kicked
quietly
out
of
his
ship
twenty
years
ago
or
more
,
and
it
might
have
been
so
much
worse
for
him
that
the
memory
of
the
episode
had
in
it
hardly
a
trace
of
misfortune
.
then
,
steam
navigation
expanding
in
these
seas
and
men
of
his
craft
being
scarce
at
first
,
he
had
'
got
on
'
after
a
sort
.
he
was
eager
to
let
strangers
know
in
a
dismal
mumble
that
he
was
'
an
old
stager
out
here
.
'
when
he
moved
,
a
skeleton
seemed
to
sway
loose
in
his
clothes
;
his
walk
was
mere
wandering
,
and
he
was
given
to
wander
thus
around
the
engine
-
room
skylight
,
smoking
,
without
relish
,
doctored
tobacco
in
a
brass
bowl
at
the
end
of
a
cherrywood
stem
four
feet
long
,
with
the
imbecile
gravity
of
a
thinker
evolving
a
system
of
philosophy
from
the
hazy
glimpse
of
a
truth
.
he
was
usually
anything
but
free
with
his
private
store
of
liquor
;
but
on
that
night
he
had
departed
from
his
principles
,
so
that
his
second
,
a
weak
-
headed
child
of
wapping
,
what
with
the
unexpectedness
of
the
treat
and
the
strength
of
the
stuff
,
had
become
very
happy
,
cheeky
,
and
talkative
.
the
fury
of
the
new
south
wales
german
was
extreme
;
he
puffed
like
an
exhaust
-
pipe
,
and
jim
,
faintly
amused
by
the
scene
,
was
impatient
for
the
time
when
he
could
get
below
:
the
last
ten
minutes
of
the
watch
were
irritating
like
a
gun
that
hangs
fire
;
those
men
did
not
belong
to
the
world
of
heroic
adventure
;
they
were
not
bad
chaps
though
.
even
the
skipper
himself
.
.
.
his
gorge
rose
at
the
mass
of
panting
flesh
from
which
issued
gurgling
mutters
,
a
cloudy
trickle
of
filthy
expressions
;
but
he
was
too
pleasurably
languid
to
dislike
actively
this
or
any
other
thing
.
the
quality
of
these
men
did
not
matter
;
he
rubbed
shoulders
with
them
,
but
they
could
not
touch
him
;
he
shared
the
air
they
breathed
,
but
he
was
different
.
.
.
.
would
the
skipper
go
for
the
engineer
?
.
the
life
was
easy
and
he
was
too
sure
of
himself
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
too
sure
of
himself
to
the
line
dividing
his
meditation
from
a
surreptitious
doze
on
his
feet
was
thinner
than
a
thread
in
a
spider
'
s
web
.
the
second
engineer
was
coming
by
easy
transitions
to
the
consideration
of
his
finances
and
of
his
courage
.
'
who
'

drunk
?
i
?
no

no
,
captain

wo

'
the
german
lifted
two
heavy
fists
to
heaven
and
shook
them
a
little
without
a
word
.
'

the
engineer
,

enthusiasm

sincere
conviction

he
let
go
the
rail
and
made
ample
gestures
as
if
demonstrating
in
the
air
the
shape
and
extent
of
his
valour
;
his
thin
voice
darted
in
prolonged
squeaks
upon
the
sea
,
he
tiptoed
back
and
forth
for
the
better
emphasis
of
utterance
,
and
suddenly
pitched
down
head
-
first
as
though
he
had
been
clubbed
from
behind
.
he
said
'
damn
!
'
as
he
tumbled
;
an
instant
of
silence
followed
upon
his
screeching
:
jim
and
the
skipper
staggered
forward
by
common
accord
,
and
catching
themselves
up
,
stood
very
stiff
and
still
gazing
,
amazed
,
at
the
undisturbed
level
of
the
sea
.
then
they
looked
upwards
at
the
stars
.
what
had
happened
?
the
wheezy
thump
of
the
engines
went
on
.
had
the
earth
been
checked
in
her
course
?
they
could
not
understand
;
and
suddenly
the
calm
sea
,
the
sky
without
a
cloud
,
appeared
formidably
insecure
in
their
immobility
,
as
if
poised
on
the
brow
of
yawning
destruction
.
the
engineer
rebounded
vertically
full
length
and
collapsed
again
into
a
vague
heap
.
this
heap
said
'
what
'
s
that

'
in
the
muffled
accents
of
profound
grief
.
a
faint
noise
as
of
thunder
,
of
thunder
infinitely
remote
,
less
than
a
sound
,
hardly
more
than
a
vibration
,
passed
slowly
,
and
the
ship
quivered
in
response
,
as
if
the
thunder
had
growled
deep
down
in
the
water
.
the
eyes
of
the
two
malays
at
the
wheel
glittered
towards
the
white
men
,
but
their
dark
hands
remained
closed
on
the
spokes
.
the
sharp
hull
driving
on
its
way
seemed
to
rise
a
few
inches
in
succession
through
its
whole
length
,
as
though
it
had
become
pliable
,
and
settled
down
again
rigidly
to
its
work
of
cleaving
the
smooth
surface
of
the
sea
.
its
quivering
stopped
,
and
the
faint
noise
of
thunder
ceased
all
at
once
,
as
though
the
ship
had
steamed
across
a
narrow
belt
of
vibrating
water
and
of
humming
air
.
a
month
or
so
afterwards
,
when
jim
,
in
answer
to
pointed
questions
,
tried
to
tell
honestly
the
truth
of
this
experience
,
he
said
,
speaking
of
the
ship
:
'
she
went
over
whatever
it
was
as
easy
as
a
snake
crawling
over
a
stick
.
'
the
illustration
was
good
:
the
questions
were
aiming
at
facts
,
and
the
official
inquiry
was
being
held
in
the
police
court
of
an
eastern
port
.
he
stood
elevated
in
the
witness
-
box
,
with
burning
cheeks
in
a
cool
lofty
room
:
the
big
framework
of
punkahs
moved
gently
to
and
fro
high
above
his
head
,
and
from
below
many
eyes
were
looking
at
him
out
of
dark
faces
,
out
of
white
faces
,
out
of
red
faces
,
out
of
faces
attentive
,
spellbound
,
as
if
all
these
people
sitting
in
orderly
rows
upon
narrow
benches
had
been
enslaved
by
the
fascination
of
his
voice
.
it
was
very
loud
,
it
rang
startling
in
his
own
ears
,
it
was
the
only
sound
audible
in
the
world
,
for
the
terribly
distinct
questions
that
extorted
his
answers
seemed
to
shape
themselves
in
anguish
and
pain
within
his
breast
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
came
to
him
poignant
and
silent
like
the
terrible
questioning
of
one
'
s
conscience
.
outside
the
court
the
sun
blazed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
within
was
the
wind
of
great
punkahs
that
made
you
shiver
,
the
shame
that
made
you
burn
,
the
attentive
eyes
whose
glance
stabbed
.
the
face
of
the
presiding
magistrate
,
clean
shaved
and
impassible
,
looked
at
him
deadly
pale
between
the
red
faces
of
the
two
nautical
assessors
.
the
light
of
a
broad
window
under
the
ceiling
fell
from
above
on
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
the
three
men
,
and
they
were
fiercely
distinct
in
the
half
-
light
of
the
big
court
-
room
where
the
audience
seemed
composed
of
staring
shadows
.
they
wanted
facts
.
facts
!
they
demanded
facts
from
him
,
as
if
facts
could
explain
anything
!
'
after
you
had
concluded
you
had
collided
with
something
floating
awash
,
say
a
water
-
logged
wreck
,
you
were
ordered
by
your
captain
to
go
forward
and
ascertain
if
there
was
any
damage
done
.
did
you
think
it
likely
from
the
force
of
the
blow
?
'
asked
the
assessor
sitting
to
the
left
.
he
had
a
thin
horseshoe
beard
,
salient
cheek
-
bones
,
and
with
both
elbows
on
the
desk
clasped
his
rugged
hands
before
his
face
,
looking
at
jim
with
thoughtful
blue
eyes
;
the
other
,
a
heavy
,
scornful
man
,
thrown
back
in
his
seat
,
his
left
arm
extended
full
length
,
drummed
delicately
with
his
finger
-
tips
on
a
blotting
-
pad
:
in
the
middle
the
magistrate
upright
in
the
roomy
arm
-
chair
,
his
head
inclined
slightly
on
the
shoulder
,
had
his
arms
crossed
on
his
breast
and
a
few
flowers
in
a
glass
vase
by
the
side
of
his
inkstand
.
'
i
did
not
,
'
said
jim
.
'
i
was
told
to
call
no
one
and
to
make
no
noise
for
fear
of
creating
a
panic
.
i
thought
the
precaution
reasonable
.
i
took
one
of
the
lamps
that
were
hung
under
the
awnings
and
went
forward
.
after
opening
the
forepeak
hatch
i
heard
splashing
in
there
.
i
lowered
then
the
lamp
the
whole
drift
of
its
lanyard
,
and
saw
that
the
forepeak
was
more
than
half
full
of
water
already
.
i
knew
then
there
must
be
a
big
hole
below
the
water
-
line
.
'
he
paused
.
'
yes
,
'
said
the
big
assessor
,
with
a
dreamy
smile
at
the
blotting
-
pad
;
his
fingers
played
incessantly
,
touching
the
paper
without
noise
.
'
i
did
not
think
of
danger
just
then
.
i
might
have
been
a
little
startled
:
all
this
happened
in
such
a
quiet
way
and
so
very
suddenly
.
i
knew
there
was
no
other
bulkhead
in
the
ship
but
the
collision
bulkhead
separating
the
forepeak
from
the
forehold
.
i
went
back
to
tell
the
captain
.
i
came
upon
the
second
engineer
getting
up
at
the
foot
of
the
bridge
-
ladder
:
he
seemed
dazed
,
and
told
me
he
thought
his
left
arm
was
broken
;
he
had
slipped
on
the
top
step
when
getting
down
while
i
was
forward
.
he
exclaimed
,
"
my
god
!
that
rotten
bulkhead
will
give
way
in
a
minute
,
and
the
damned
thing
will
go
down
under
us
like
a
lump
of
lead
.
"
he
pushed
me
away
with
his
right
arm
and
ran
before
me
up
the
ladder
,
shouting
as
he
climbed
.
his
left
arm
hung
by
his
side
.
i
followed
up
in
time
to
see
the
captain
rush
at
him
and
knock
him
down
flat
on
his
back
.
he
did
not
strike
him
again
:
he
stood
bending
over
him
and
speaking
angrily
but
quite
low
.
i
fancy
he
was
asking
him
why
the
devil
he
did
not
go
and
stop
the
engines
,
instead
of
making
a
row
about
it
on
deck
.
i
heard
him
say
,
"
get
up
!
run
!
fly
!
"
he
swore
also
.
the
engineer
slid
down
the
starboard
ladder
and
bolted
round
the
skylight
to
the
engine
-
room
companion
which
was
on
the
port
side
.
he
moaned
as
he
ran
.
he
spoke
slowly
;
he
remembered
swiftly
and
with
extreme
vividness
;
he
could
have
reproduced
like
an
echo
the
moaning
of
the
engineer
for
the
better
information
of
these
men
who
wanted
facts
.
after
his
first
feeling
of
revolt
he
had
come
round
to
the
view
that
only
a
meticulous
precision
of
statement
would
bring
out
the
true
horror
behind
the
appalling
face
of
things
.
the
facts
those
men
were
so
eager
to
know
had
been
visible
,
tangible
,
open
to
the
senses
,
occupying
their
place
in
space
and
time
,
requiring
for
their
existence
a
fourteen
-
hundred
-
ton
steamer
and
twenty
-
seven
minutes
by
the
watch
;
they
made
a
whole
that
had
features
,
shades
of
expression
,
a
complicated
aspect
that
could
be
remembered
by
the
eye
,
and
something
else
besides
,
something
invisible
,
a
directing
spirit
of
perdition
that
dwelt
within
,
like
a
malevolent
soul
in
a
detestable
body
.
he
was
anxious
to
make
this
clear
.
this
had
not
been
a
common
affair
,
everything
in
it
had
been
of
the
utmost
importance
,
and
fortunately
he
remembered
everything
.
he
wanted
to
go
on
talking
for
truth
'
s
sake
,
perhaps
for
his
own
sake
also
;
and
while
his
utterance
was
deliberate
,
his
mind
positively
flew
round
and
round
the
serried
circle
of
facts
that
had
surged
up
all
about
him
to
cut
him
off
from
the
rest
of
his
kind
:
it
was
like
a
creature
that
,
finding
itself
imprisoned
within
an
enclosure
of
high
stakes
,
dashes
round
and
round
,
distracted
in
the
night
,
trying
to
find
a
weak
spot
,
a
crevice
,
a
place
to
scale
,
some
opening
through
which
it
may
squeeze
itself
and
escape
.
this
awful
activity
of
mind
made
him
hesitate
at
times
in
his
speech
.
'
the
captain
kept
on
moving
here
and
there
on
the
bridge
;
he
seemed
calm
enough
,
only
he
stumbled
several
times
;
and
once
as
i
stood
speaking
to
him
he
walked
right
into
me
as
though
he
had
been
stone
-
blind
.
he
made
no
definite
answer
to
what
i
had
to
tell
.
he
mumbled
to
himself
;
all
i
heard
of
it
were
a
few
words
that
sounded
like
"
confounded
steam
!
"
and
"
infernal
steam
!
"
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
something
about
steam
.
i
thought
'
he
was
becoming
irrelevant
;
a
question
to
the
point
cut
short
his
speech
,
like
a
pang
of
pain
,
and
he
felt
extremely
discouraged
and
weary
.
he
was
coming
to
that
,
he
was
coming
to
that
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
now
,
checked
brutally
,
he
had
to
answer
by
yes
or
no
.
he
answered
truthfully
by
a
curt
'
yes
,
i
did
'
;
and
fair
of
face
,
big
of
frame
,
with
young
,
gloomy
eyes
,
he
held
his
shoulders
upright
above
the
box
while
his
soul
writhed
within
him
.
he
was
made
to
answer
another
question
so
much
to
the
point
and
so
useless
,
then
waited
again
.
his
mouth
was
tastelessly
dry
,
as
though
he
had
been
eating
dust
,
then
salt
and
bitter
as
after
a
drink
of
sea
-
water
.
he
wiped
his
damp
forehead
,
passed
his
tongue
over
parched
lips
,
felt
a
shiver
run
down
his
back
.
the
big
assessor
had
dropped
his
eyelids
,
and
drummed
on
without
a
sound
,
careless
and
mournful
;
the
eyes
of
the
other
above
the
sunburnt
,
clasped
fingers
seemed
to
glow
with
kindliness
;
the
magistrate
had
swayed
forward
;
his
pale
face
hovered
near
the
flowers
,
and
then
dropping
sideways
over
the
arm
of
his
chair
,
he
rested
his
temple
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
.
the
wind
of
the
punkahs
eddied
down
on
the
heads
,
on
the
dark
-
faced
natives
wound
about
in
voluminous
draperies
,
on
the
europeans
sitting
together
very
hot
and
in
drill
suits
that
seemed
to
fit
them
as
close
as
their
skins
,
and
holding
their
round
pith
hats
on
their
knees
;
while
gliding
along
the
walls
the
court
peons
,
buttoned
tight
in
long
white
coats
,
flitted
rapidly
to
and
fro
,
running
on
bare
toes
,
red
-
sashed
,
red
turban
on
head
,
as
noiseless
as
ghosts
,
and
on
the
alert
like
so
many
retrievers
.
jim
'
s
eyes
,
wandering
in
the
intervals
of
his
answers
,
rested
upon
a
white
man
who
sat
apart
from
the
others
,
with
his
face
worn
and
clouded
,
but
with
quiet
eyes
that
glanced
straight
,
interested
and
clear
.
jim
answered
another
question
and
was
tempted
to
cry
out
,
'
what
'
s
the
good
of
this
!
what
'
s
the
good
!
'
he
tapped
with
his
foot
slightly
,
bit
his
lip
,
and
looked
away
over
the
heads
.
he
met
the
eyes
of
the
white
man
.
the
glance
directed
at
him
was
not
the
fascinated
stare
of
the
others
.
it
was
an
act
of
intelligent
volition
.
jim
between
two
questions
forgot
himself
so
far
as
to
find
leisure
for
a
thought
.
this
fellow
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
ran
the
thought
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
looks
at
me
as
though
he
could
see
somebody
or
something
past
my
shoulder
.
he
had
come
across
that
man
before
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
the
street
perhaps
.
he
was
positive
he
had
never
spoken
to
him
.
for
days
,
for
many
days
,
he
had
spoken
to
no
one
,
but
had
held
silent
,
incoherent
,
and
endless
converse
with
himself
,
like
a
prisoner
alone
in
his
cell
or
like
a
wayfarer
lost
in
a
wilderness
.
at
present
he
was
answering
questions
that
did
not
matter
though
they
had
a
purpose
,
but
he
doubted
whether
he
would
ever
again
speak
out
as
long
as
he
lived
.
the
sound
of
his
own
truthful
statements
confirmed
his
deliberate
opinion
that
speech
was
of
no
use
to
him
any
longer
.
that
man
there
seemed
to
be
aware
of
his
hopeless
difficulty
.
jim
looked
at
him
,
then
turned
away
resolutely
,
as
after
a
final
parting
.
and
later
on
,
many
times
,
in
distant
parts
of
the
world
,
marlow
showed
himself
willing
to
remember
jim
,
to
remember
him
at
length
,
in
detail
and
audibly
.
perhaps
it
would
be
after
dinner
,
on
a
verandah
draped
in
motionless
foliage
and
crowned
with
flowers
,
in
the
deep
dusk
speckled
by
fiery
cigar
-
ends
.
the
elongated
bulk
of
each
cane
-
chair
harboured
a
silent
listener
.
now
and
then
a
small
red
glow
would
move
abruptly
,
and
expanding
light
up
the
fingers
of
a
languid
hand
,
part
of
a
face
in
profound
repose
,
or
flash
a
crimson
gleam
into
a
pair
of
pensive
eyes
overshadowed
by
a
fragment
of
an
unruffled
forehead
;
and
with
the
very
first
word
uttered
marlow
'
s
body
,
extended
at
rest
in
the
seat
,
would
become
very
still
,
as
though
his
spirit
had
winged
its
way
back
into
the
lapse
of
time
and
were
speaking
through
his
lips
from
the
past
.
'
oh
yes
.
i
attended
the
inquiry
,
'
he
would
say
,
'
and
to
this
day
i
have
not
left
off
wondering
why
i
went
.
i
am
willing
to
believe
each
of
us
has
a
guardian
angel
,
if
you
fellows
will
concede
to
me
that
each
of
us
has
a
familiar
devil
as
well
.
i
want
you
to
own
up
,
because
i
do
not
like
to
feel
exceptional
in
any
way
,
and
i
know
i
have
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
devil
,
i
mean
.
i
have
not
seen
him
,
of
course
,
but
i
go
upon
circumstantial
evidence
.
he
is
there
right
enough
,
and
,
being
malicious
,
he
lets
me
in
for
that
kind
of
thing
.
what
kind
of
thing
,
you
ask
?
why
,
the
inquiry
thing
,
the
yellow
-
dog
thing
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
would
not
think
a
mangy
,
native
tyke
would
be
allowed
to
trip
up
people
in
the
verandah
of
a
magistrate
'
s
court
,
would
you
?
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
kind
of
thing
that
by
devious
,
unexpected
,
truly
diabolical
ways
causes
me
to
run
up
against
men
with
soft
spots
,
with
hard
spots
,
with
hidden
plague
spots
,
by
jove
!
and
loosens
their
tongues
at
the
sight
of
me
for
their
infernal
confidences
;
as
though
,
forsooth
,
i
had
no
confidences
to
make
to
myself
,
as
though
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
god
help
me
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
did
not
have
enough
confidential
information
about
myself
to
harrow
my
own
soul
till
the
end
of
my
appointed
time
.
and
what
i
have
done
to
be
thus
favoured
i
want
to
know
.
i
declare
i
am
as
full
of
my
own
concerns
as
the
next
man
,
and
i
have
as
much
memory
as
the
average
pilgrim
in
this
valley
,
so
you
see
i
am
not
particularly
fit
to
be
a
receptacle
of
confessions
.
then
why
?
ca
not
tell
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
unless
it
be
to
make
time
pass
away
after
dinner
.
charley
,
my
dear
chap
,
your
dinner
was
extremely
good
,
and
in
consequence
these
men
here
look
upon
a
quiet
rubber
as
a
tumultuous
occupation
.
they
wallow
in
your
good
chairs
and
think
to
themselves
,
"
hang
exertion
.
let
that
marlow
talk
.
"
'
talk
?
so
be
it
.
and
it
is
easy
enough
to
talk
of
master
jim
,
after
a
good
spread
,
two
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
-
level
,
with
a
box
of
decent
cigars
handy
,
on
a
blessed
evening
of
freshness
and
starlight
that
would
make
the
best
of
us
forget
we
are
only
on
sufferance
here
and
got
to
pick
our
way
in
cross
lights
,
watching
every
precious
minute
and
every
irremediable
step
,
trusting
we
shall
manage
yet
to
go
out
decently
in
the
end
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
not
so
sure
of
it
after
all
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
with
dashed
little
help
to
expect
from
those
we
touch
elbows
with
right
and
left
.
of
course
there
are
men
here
and
there
to
whom
the
whole
of
life
is
like
an
after
-
dinner
hour
with
a
cigar
;
easy
,
pleasant
,
empty
,
perhaps
enlivened
by
some
fable
of
strife
to
be
forgotten
before
the
end
is
told
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
before
the
end
is
told
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
even
if
there
happens
to
be
any
end
to
it
.
'
my
eyes
met
his
for
the
first
time
at
that
inquiry
.
you
must
know
that
everybody
connected
in
any
way
with
the
sea
was
there
,
because
the
affair
had
been
notorious
for
days
,
ever
since
that
mysterious
cable
message
came
from
aden
to
start
us
all
cackling
.
i
say
mysterious
,
because
it
was
so
in
a
sense
though
it
contained
a
naked
fact
,
about
as
naked
and
ugly
as
a
fact
can
well
be
.
the
whole
waterside
talked
of
nothing
else
.
first
thing
in
the
morning
as
i
was
dressing
in
my
state
-
room
,
i
would
hear
through
the
bulkhead
my
parsee
dubash
jabbering
about
the
patna
with
the
steward
,
while
he
drank
a
cup
of
tea
,
by
favour
,
in
the
pantry
.
no
sooner
on
shore
i
would
meet
some
acquaintance
,
and
the
first
remark
would
be
,
"
did
you
ever
hear
of
anything
to
beat
this
?
"
and
according
to
his
kind
the
man
would
smile
cynically
,
or
look
sad
,
or
let
out
a
swear
or
two
.
complete
strangers
would
accost
each
other
familiarly
,
just
for
the
sake
of
easing
their
minds
on
the
subject
:
every
confounded
loafer
in
the
town
came
in
for
a
harvest
of
drinks
over
this
affair
:
you
heard
of
it
in
the
harbour
office
,
at
every
ship
-
broker
'
s
,
at
your
agent
'
s
,
from
whites
,
from
natives
,
from
half
-
castes
,
from
the
very
boatmen
squatting
half
naked
on
the
stone
steps
as
you
went
up
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
by
jove
!
there
was
some
indignation
,
not
a
few
jokes
,
and
no
end
of
discussions
as
to
what
had
become
of
them
,
you
know
.
this
went
on
for
a
couple
of
weeks
or
more
,
and
the
opinion
that
whatever
was
mysterious
in
this
affair
would
turn
out
to
be
tragic
as
well
,
began
to
prevail
,
when
one
fine
morning
,
as
i
was
standing
in
the
shade
by
the
steps
of
the
harbour
office
,
i
perceived
four
men
walking
towards
me
along
the
quay
.
i
wondered
for
a
while
where
that
queer
lot
had
sprung
from
,
and
suddenly
,
i
may
say
,
i
shouted
to
myself
,
"
here
they
are
!
"
'
there
they
were
,
sure
enough
,
three
of
them
as
large
as
life
,
and
one
much
larger
of
girth
than
any
living
man
has
a
right
to
be
,
just
landed
with
a
good
breakfast
inside
of
them
from
an
outward
-
bound
dale
line
steamer
that
had
come
in
about
an
hour
after
sunrise
.
there
could
be
no
mistake
;
i
spotted
the
jolly
skipper
of
the
patna
at
the
first
glance
:
the
fattest
man
in
the
whole
blessed
tropical
belt
clear
round
that
good
old
earth
of
ours
.
moreover
,
nine
months
or
so
before
,
i
had
come
across
him
in
samarang
.
his
steamer
was
loading
in
the
roads
,
and
he
was
abusing
the
tyrannical
institutions
of
the
german
empire
,
and
soaking
himself
in
beer
all
day
long
and
day
after
day
in
de
jongh
'
s
back
-
shop
,
till
de
jongh
,
who
charged
a
guilder
for
every
bottle
without
as
much
as
the
quiver
of
an
eyelid
,
would
beckon
me
aside
,
and
,
with
his
little
leathery
face
all
puckered
up
,
declare
confidentially
,
"
business
is
business
,
but
this
man
,
captain
,
he
make
me
very
sick
.
tfui
!
"
'
i
was
looking
at
him
from
the
shade
.
he
was
hurrying
on
a
little
in
advance
,
and
the
sunlight
beating
on
him
brought
out
his
bulk
in
a
startling
way
.
he
made
me
think
of
a
trained
baby
elephant
walking
on
hind
-
legs
.
he
was
extravagantly
gorgeous
too
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
got
up
in
a
soiled
sleeping
-
suit
,
bright
green
and
deep
orange
vertical
stripes
,
with
a
pair
of
ragged
straw
slippers
on
his
bare
feet
,
and
somebody
'
s
cast
-
off
pith
hat
,
very
dirty
and
two
sizes
too
small
for
him
,
tied
up
with
a
manilla
rope
-
yarn
on
the
top
of
his
big
head
.
you
understand
a
man
like
that
has
not
the
ghost
of
a
chance
when
it
comes
to
borrowing
clothes
.
very
well
.
on
he
came
in
hot
haste
,
without
a
look
right
or
left
,
passed
within
three
feet
of
me
,
and
in
the
innocence
of
his
heart
went
on
pelting
upstairs
into
the
harbour
office
to
make
his
deposition
,
or
report
,
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
.
'
it
appears
he
addressed
himself
in
the
first
instance
to
the
principal
shipping
-
master
.
archie
ruthvel
had
just
come
in
,
and
,
as
his
story
goes
,
was
about
to
begin
his
arduous
day
by
giving
a
dressing
-
down
to
his
chief
clerk
.
some
of
you
might
have
known
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
an
obliging
little
portuguese
half
-
caste
with
a
miserably
skinny
neck
,
and
always
on
the
hop
to
get
something
from
the
shipmasters
in
the
way
of
eatables
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
piece
of
salt
pork
,
a
bag
of
biscuits
,
a
few
potatoes
,
or
what
not
.
one
voyage
,
i
recollect
,
i
tipped
him
a
live
sheep
out
of
the
remnant
of
my
sea
-
stock
:
not
that
i
wanted
him
to
do
anything
for
me
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
couldn
'
t
,
you
know
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
because
his
childlike
belief
in
the
sacred
right
to
perquisites
quite
touched
my
heart
.
it
was
so
strong
as
to
be
almost
beautiful
.
the
race
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
two
races
rather
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
the
climate
however
,
never
mind
.
i
know
where
i
have
a
friend
for
life
.
'
well
,
ruthvel
says
he
was
giving
him
a
severe
lecture
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
on
official
morality
,
i
suppose
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
when
he
heard
a
kind
of
subdued
commotion
at
his
back
,
and
turning
his
head
he
saw
,
in
his
own
words
,
something
round
and
enormous
,
resembling
a
sixteen
-
hundred
-
weight
sugar
-
hogshead
wrapped
in
striped
flannelette
,
up
-
ended
in
the
middle
of
the
large
floor
space
in
the
office
.
he
declares
he
was
so
taken
aback
that
for
quite
an
appreciable
time
he
did
not
realise
the
thing
was
alive
,
and
sat
still
wondering
for
what
purpose
and
by
what
means
that
object
had
been
transported
in
front
of
his
desk
.
the
archway
from
the
ante
-
room
was

their

climbing
on

by
that
time
the
fellow
had
managed
to
tug
and
jerk
his
hat
clear
of
his
head
,
and
advanced
with
slight
bows
at
ruthvel
,
who
told
me
the
sight
was
so
discomposing
that
for
some
time
he
listened
,
quite
unable
to
make
out
what
that
apparition
wanted
.
it
spoke
in
a
voice
harsh
and
lugubrious
but
intrepid
,
and
little
by
little
it
dawned
upon
archie
that
this
was
a
development
of
the
patna
case

he
says
that
as
soon
as
he
understood
who
it
was
before
him
he
felt
quite
unwell

so
sympathetic

easily
upset

pulled
himself
together

shouted

at

some
sort

he
saw
the
old

lift
his
head
from
some
writing
so
sharp
that
his
nose
-
nippers
fell
off
,
banged
the
door
to
,
and
fled
to
his
desk
,
where
he
had
some
papers
waiting
for
his
signature
:
but
he
says
the
row
that
burst
out
in
there
was
so
awful
that
he
could
not
collect
his
senses
sufficiently
to
remember
the
spelling
of
his
own
name

'

the
most
sensitive
shipping

master
in

two
hemispheres
.
he
declares
he
felt
as
though
he
had
thrown
a
man
to
a
hungry
lion
.
no
doubt
the
noise
was
great
.
i
heard
it
down
below
,
and
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
it
was
heard
clear
across
the
esplanade
as
far
as
the
band
-
stand
.
old
father
elliot
had
a
great
stock
of
words
and
could
shout
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
did
not
mind
who
he
shouted
at
either
.
he
would
have
shouted
at
the
viceroy
himself
.
as
he
used
to
tell
me
:
"
i
am
as
high
as
i
can
get
;
my
pension
is
safe
.
i
'
ve
a
few
pounds
laid
by
,
and
if
they
do
not
like
my
notions
of
duty
i
would
just
as
soon
go
home
as
not
.
i
am
an
old
man
,
and
i
have
always
spoken
my
mind
.
all
i
care
for
now
is
to
see
my
girls
married
before
i
die

"
he
was
a
little
crazy
on
that
point
.
his
three
daughters
were
awfully
nice
,
though
they
resembled
him
amazingly
,
and
on
the
mornings
he
woke
up
with
a
gloomy
view
of
their
matrimonial
prospects
the
office
would
read
it
in
his
eye
and
tremble
,
because
,
they
said
,
he
was
sure
to
have
somebody
for
breakfast
.
however
,
that
morning
he
did
not
eat
the
renegade
,
but
,
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
carry
on
the
metaphor
,
chewed
him
up
very
small
,
so
to
speak
,
and
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
ah
!
ejected
him
again
.
'
thus
in
a
very
few
moments
i
saw
his
monstrous
bulk
descend
in
haste
and
stand
still
on
the
outer
steps
.
he
had
stopped
close
to
me
for
the
purpose
of
profound
meditation
:
his
large
purple
cheeks
quivered
.
he
was
biting
his
thumb
,
and
after
a
while
noticed
me
with
a
sidelong
vexed
look
.
the
other
three
chaps
that
had
landed
with
him
made
a
little
group
waiting
at
some
distance
.
there
was
a
sallow
-
faced
,
mean
little
chap
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
,
and
a
long
individual
in
a
blue
flannel
coat
,
as
dry
as
a
chip
and
no
stouter
than
a
broomstick
,
with
drooping
grey
moustaches
,
who
looked
about
him
with
an
air
of
jaunty
imbecility
.
the
third
was
an
upstanding
,
broad
-
shouldered
youth
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
turning
his
back
on
the
other
two
who
appeared
to
be
talking
together
earnestly
.
he
stared
across
the
empty
esplanade
.
a
ramshackle
gharry
,
all
dust
and
venetian
blinds
,
pulled
up
short
opposite
the
group
,
and
the
driver
,
throwing
up
his
right
foot
over
his
knee
,
gave
himself
up
to
the
critical
examination
of
his
toes
.
the
young
chap
,
making
no
movement
,
not
even
stirring
his
head
,
just
stared
into
the
sunshine
.
this
was
my
first
view
of
jim
.
he
looked
as
unconcerned
and
unapproachable
as
only
the
young
can
look
.
there
he
stood
,
clean
-
limbed
,
clean
-
faced
,
firm
on
his
feet
,
as
promising
a
boy
as
the
sun
ever
shone
on
;
and
,
looking
at
him
,
knowing
all
he
knew
and
a
little
more
too
,
i
was
as
angry
as
though
i
had
detected
him
trying
to
get
something
out
of
me
by
false
pretences
.
he
had
no
business
to
look
so
sound
.
i
thought
to
myself
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
well
,
if
this
sort
can
go
wrong
like
that
.
.
.
and
i
felt
as
though
i
could
fling
down
my
hat
and
dance
on
it
from
sheer
mortification
,
as
i
once
saw
the
skipper
of
an
italian
barque
do
because
his
duffer
of
a
mate
got
into
a
mess
with
his
anchors
when
making
a
flying
moor
in
a
roadstead
full
of
ships
.
i
asked
myself
,
seeing
him
there
apparently
so
much
at
ease
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
is
he
silly
?
is
he
callous
?
he
seemed
ready
to
start
whistling
a
tune
.
and
note
,
i
did
not
care
a
rap
about
the
behaviour
of
the
other
two
.
their
persons
somehow
fitted
the
tale
that
was
public
property
,
and
was
going
to
be
the
subject
of
an
official
inquiry
.
that
old
mad
rogue
upstairs
called
me
a
hound
,
"
said
the
captain
of
the
patna
.
i
ca
not
tell
whether
he
recognised
me
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
rather
think
he
did
;
but
at
any
rate
our
glances
met
.
he
glared
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
smiled
;
hound
was
the
very
mildest
epithet
that
had
reached
me
through
the
open
window
.
did
he
?
"
i
said
from
some
strange
inability
to
hold
my
tongue
.
he
nodded
,
bit
his
thumb
again
,
swore
under
his
breath
:
then
lifting
his
head
and
looking
at
me
with
sullen
and
passionate
impudence
.

paused
reflectively
,

without
effort

could
depict
to
myself
the
