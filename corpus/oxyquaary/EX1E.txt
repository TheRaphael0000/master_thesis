the
disturbance
caused
by
my
father
'
s
outbreak
was
quickly
suppressed
,
for
george
got
him
out
of
the
temple
almost
immediately
;
it
was
bruited
about
,
however
,
that
the
sunchild
had
come
down
from
the
palace
of
the
sun
,
but
had
disappeared
as
soon
as
any
one
had
tried
to
touch
him
.
in
vain
did
hanky
try
to
put
fresh
life
into
his
sermon
;
its
back
had
been
broken
,
and
large
numbers
left
the
church
to
see
what
they
could
hear
outside
,
or
failing
information
,
to
discourse
more
freely
with
one
another
.
hanky
did
his
best
to
quiet
his
hearers
when
he
found
that
he
could
not
infuriate
them
,
.
.

.
"
this
poor
man
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
already
known
to
me
,
as
one
of
those
who
have
deluded
themselves
into
believing
that
they
are
the
sunchild
.
i
have
known
of
his
so
declaring
himself
,
more
than
once
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bridgeford
,
and
others
have
not
infrequently
done
the
same
;
i
did
not
at
first
recognize
him
,
and
regret
that
the
shock
of
horror
his
words
occasioned
me
should
have
prompted
me
to
suggest
violence
against
him
.
let
this
unfortunate
affair
pass
from
your
minds
,
and
let
me
again
urge
upon
you
the
claims
of
the
sunchild
evidence
society

"
the
audience
on
hearing
that
they
were
to
be
told
more
about
the
sunchild
evidence
society
melted
away
even
more
rapidly
than
before
,
and
the
sermon
fizzled
out
to
an
ignominious
end
quite
unworthy
of
its
occasion
.
about
half
-
past
twelve
,
the
service
ended
,
and
hanky
went
to
the
robing

room
to
take
off
his
vestments
.
yram
,
the
mayor
,

waited
for
him
at
the
door
opposite
to
that
through
which
my
father
had
been
taken
;
while
waiting
,
yram
scribbled
off
two
notes
in
pencil
,
one
to
dr

she
gave
these
notes
to
the
mayor
,

bade
him
bring
both
the
invited
guests
along
with
him

the

left
just

still
furious
about

just
taken

"
hanky
looked
black
and
said
nothing
.
as
for
panky
he
was
morally
in
a
state
of
collapse
,
and
did
not
count
.
hardly
had
they
reached
the
mayor
'

house
when
the
mayor
also
arrived
with
dr
downie

mrs

,
both
of
whom
had
seen
and
recognised
my
father
in
spite
of
his
having
dyed
his
hair
.
dr

met
him
at
supper
in
mr
thims
'

rooms
when
he
had
visited
bridgeford
,
and
naturally
enough
had
observed
him
closely
.
mrs
humdrum
,
as
i
have
already
said
,
had
seen
him
more
than
once
when
he
was
in
prison
.
she
and
dr
downie
were
talking
earnestly
over
the
strange
reappearance
of
one
whom
they
had
believed
long
since
dead
,
but
yram
imposed
on
them
the
same
silence
that
she
had
already
imposed
on
the
professors

little
alarmed

secret
conclave

does
not
know

well
a

can
hold
her
tongue

she
chooses

should
have
told

you
had
better
hear
everything
yourself

hanky
still
looked
black
,

he
said
nothing
.
luncheon
was
promptly
served
,
and
done
justice
to
in
spite
of
much
preoccupation
;
for
if
there
is
one
thing
that
gives
a
better
appetite
than
another
,
it
is
a
sunday
morning
'
s
service
with
a
charity
sermon
to
follow
.
as
the
guests
might
not
talk
on
the
subject
they
wanted
to
talk
about
,
and
were
in
no
humour
to
speak
of
anything
else
,
they
gave
their
whole
attention
to
the
good
things
that
were
before
them
,
without
so
much
as
a
thought
about
reserving
themselves
for
the
evening
'
s
banquet
.
nevertheless
,
when
luncheon
was
over
,
the
professors
were
in
no
more
genial
,
manageable
,
state
of
mind
than
they
had
been
when
it
began
.
when
the
servants
had
left
the
room
,
yram
said
to
hanky
,
"
you
saw
the
prisoner

was
the
man
you
met
on
thursday
night

"
"
certainly
,
he
was
wearing
the
forbidden
dress
and
he
had
many
quails
in
his
possession
.
there
is
no
doubt
also
that
he
was
a
foreign
devil

at
this
point
,
it
being
now
nearly
half
-
past
two
,
george
came
in
,

took
a
seat
next
to
mrs

.
.
.
between
her
and
his
mother

.

.
.

who
of
course
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
the
mayor
opposite
to
her
.
on
one
side
of
the
table
sat
the
professors
,

on
the
other
dr
downie
,
mrs
humdrum
,

george
,
who
had
heard
the
last
few
words
that
hanky
had
spoken
.
"
now
who
,
"
said
yram
,
"
is
this
unfortunate
creature
to
be

is
brought
up

,
on
the
charge
of
poaching

"
"
it
is
not
necessary
,
"
said
hanky
severely
,
"
that
he
should
be
brought
up
for
poaching
.
he
is
a
foreign
devil

as
such
your
son
is
bound
to
fling
him
without
trial
into
the
blue
pool
.
why
bring
a
smaller
charge
when
you
must
inflict
the
death
penalty
on
a
more
serious
one
?
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
shall
feel
it
my
duty
to
report
the
matter
at
headquarters
,
unless
i
am
satisfied
that
the
death
penalty
has
been
inflicted
.
"
"
of
course
,
"
said
george
,
"
we
must
all
of
us
do
our
duty
,
and
i
shall
not
shrink
from
mine
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
i
have
arrested
this
man
on
a
charge
of
poaching
,
and
must
give
my
reasons
;
the
case
cannot
be
dropped
,
and
it
must
be
heard
in
public
.
am
i
,
or
am
i
not
,
to
have
the
sworn
depositions
of
both
you
gentlemen
to
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
is
the
man
you
saw
with
quails
in
his
possession
?
if
you
can
depose
to
this
he
will
be
convicted
,
for
there
can
be
no
doubt
he
killed
the
birds
himself
.
the
least
penalty
my
father
can
inflict
is
twelve
months
'
imprisonment
with
hard
labour
;
and
he
must
undergo
this
sentence
before
i
can
blue
-
pool
him
.
"
then
comes
the
question
whether
or
no
he
is
a
foreign
devil
.
i
may
decide
this
in
private
,
but
i
must
have
depositions
on
oath
before
i
do
so
,
and
at
present
i
have
nothing
but
hearsay
.
perhaps
you
gentlemen
can
give
me
the
evidence
i
shall
require
,
but
the
case
is
one
of
such
importance
that
were
the
prisoner
proved
never
so
clearly
to
be
a
foreign
devil
,
i
should
not
blue
-
pool
him
till
i
had
taken
the
king
'
s
pleasure
concerning
him
.
i
shall
rejoice
,
therefore
,
if
you
gentlemen
can
help
me
to
sustain
the
charge
of
poaching
,
and
thus
give
me
legal
standing
-
ground
for
deferring
action
which
the
king
might
regret
,
and
which
once
taken
cannot
be
recalled
.

settle

what

shall
allow
the
prisoner
to

he
is

up
to

this

the
rest
will
settle
itself

he
has
declared
himself
to
be
the
sunchild

will
probably
do
so
again

i

identify
him

is
dr
downie

so
is
mrs
humdrum
,
the
interpreter
,
and
doubtless
my
father
.
others
of
known
respectability
will
also
do
so
,
and
his
marks
and
measurements
are
sure
to
correspond
quite
sufficiently
.
the
question
is
,
whether
all
this
is
to
be
allowed
to
appear
on
evidence
,

whether
it
is
to
be
established

it
easily
may
,

we
give
our
minds
to
it
,

he
is
not

whatever
else
he
is

hanky

he

he
must

the
charge
of
poaching
cannot
be
dropped
,
be
a
poacher
and
a
foreign
devil

i
was
doubtless
too
hasty
when
i
said
that
i
believed
i
recognized
the
man
as

more
than

up
at
the

morning

walked
three

four
hundred
yards

there
was
less
snow

over
the
snow

went
two

once
a

he
showed
the
soles
of
his
boots
,

the
professors
were
obliged
to
admit
that
the
tracks
were
his
.
he
cautioned
them
as
to
the
rest
of
the
points
on
which
they
relied
.
might
they
not
be
as
mistaken
,
as
they
had
just
proved
to
be
about
the
tracks
?
he
could
not
,
however
,
stir
them
from
sticking
to
it
that
there
was
enough
evidence
to
prove
my
father
to
be
a
foreign
devil
,

declaring
their
readiness
to
depose
to
the
facts
on
oath
.
in
the
end
hanky
again
fiercely
accused
him
of
trying
to
shield
the
prisoner
.
"

said
george

hanky
significantly

innuendo

he
went
to
a
writing

table
in
another
part

the

out
the

eagerly
in
an
undertone
among

blind
with
rage

had
a
sense
that

was
going
to
be
outwitted
;
the
mayor

mrs

had
already
seen
that
george
thought
he
had
all
the
trumps
in
his
own
hand
,
but
they
did
not
know
more

dr
downie
was
frightened
,
and
panky
so
muddled
as
to
be
hors
de
combat
.
george
now
rejoined
the
professors
,
and
read
the
depositions
:
the
mayor
administered
the
oath
according
to
erewhonian
custom
;
the
professors
signed
without
a
word
,
and
george
then
handed
the
document
to
his
father
to
countersign
.
the
mayor
examined
it
,
and
almost
immediately
said
,
"
my
dear
george
,
you
have
made
a
mistake
;
these
depositions

for
deponents
who
are
on
the
point
of
death

"
"
alas

answered
george

"
there
is
no
help
for
it

my
utmost

be
able
to
shut
my
eyes

i
can
now
no
longer
do
so

as
the
inevitable
consequence

i
must
blue

pool
both
the
professors

midnight

man
of
ordinary

not

have
done

this
time

started

horrified
astonishment

he
could
hoodwink
two
such
learned
professors
so
cleverly
as
to
get
their
permit
out
of
them
.
obviously
he
seduced
you
into
selling
him
your
permit
,
and
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
presume
because
he
wanted
a
little
of
our
money
.

he
made
you
pay
him
for
his

am
satisfied
that
you
have
not
only
had
traffic
with
a
foreign
devil
,

traffic
of
a
singularly
atrocious
kind

this
being
so

i
shall

you

you

goes

from
that
point
you
can
walk
up

be
dragged
up

you
may
prefer
,

you
will
probably
find
walking
more
comfortable

hanky

looking
for
all
the

like
a
rat
caught
in
a
trap
.
as
he
spoke
he
seized
a
knife
from
the
table
,
whereon
george
pulled
a
pair
of
handcuffs
from
his
pocket

slipped
them
on
to

was
heard
from

it
said
;
and
the
effect
was
so
comic
that
every
one
except

smiled
.
meanwhile
yram
had
conducted
dr
downie

mrs

into
an
adjoining
room
.
they
returned
in
about
ten
minutes
,

dr
downie
asked
mrs

to
say
what
they
had
agreed
to
recommend
.
"
we
think
,
"
said
she
very
demurely
,
"
that
the
strict
course
would
be
to
drop
the
charge
of
poaching
,

blue

pool
both
the
professors
and
the
prisoner
without
delay

"
we
also
think
that
the
proper
thing
would
be
to
place
on
record
that
the
prisoner
is
the
sunchild
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
about
which
neither
dr
downie
nor
i
have
a
shadow
of
doubt
.
"
these
measures
we
hold
to
be
the
only
legal
ones
,
but
at
the
same
time
we
do
not
recommend
them
.
we
think
it
would
offend
the
public
conscience
if
it
came
to
be
known
,
as
it
certainly
would
,
that
the
sunchild
was
violently
killed
,
on
the
very
day
that
had
seen
us
dedicate
a
temple
in
his
honour
,
and
perhaps
at
the
very
hour
when
laudatory
speeches
were
being
made
about
him
at
the
mayor
'
s
banquet
;
we
think
also
that
we
should
strain
a
good
many
points
rather
than
blue
-
pool
the
professors
.
"
nothing
is
perfect
,
and
truth
makes
her
mistakes
like
other
people
;
when
she
goes
wrong
and
reduces
herself
to
such
an
absurdity
as
she
has
here
done
,
those
who
love
her
must
save
her
from
herself
,
correct
her
,
and
rehabilitate
her
.
"
our
conclusion
,
therefore
,
is
this
:
-
"
the
prisoner
must
recant
on
oath
his
statement
that
he
is
the
sunchild
.
the
interpreter
must
be
squared
,
or
convinced
of
his
mistake
.
the
mayoress
,
dr
downie
,
i
,
and
the
gaoler
(
with
the
interpreter
if
we
can
manage
him
)
,
must
depose
on
oath
that
the
prisoner
is
not
higgs
.
this
must
be
our
contribution
to
the
rehabilitation
of
truth
.
"
the
professors
must
contribute
as
follows
:
they
must
swear
that
the
prisoner
is
not
the
man
they
met
with
quails
in
his
possession
on
thursday
night
.
they
must
further
swear
that
they
have
one
or
both
of
them
known
him
,
off
and
on
,
for
many
years
past
,
as
a
monomaniac
with
sunchildism
on
the
brain
but
otherwise
harmless
.
if
they
will
do
this
,
no
proceedings
are
to
be
taken
against
them
.
"
the
mayor
'
s
contribution
shall
be
to
reprimand
the
prisoner
,
and
order
him
to
repeat
his
recantation
in
the
new
temple
before
the
manager
and
head
cashier
,
and
to
confirm
his
statement
on
oath
by
kissing
the
reliquary
containing
the
newly
found
relic
.
"
the
ranger
and
the
master
of
the
gaol
must
contribute
that
the
prisoner
'
s
measurements
,
and
the
marks
found
on
his
body
,
negative
all
possibility
of
his
identity
with
the
sunchild
,
and
that
all
the
hair
on
the
covered
as
well
as
the
uncovered
parts
of
his
body
was
found
to
be
jet
black
.
"
we
advise
further
that
the
prisoner
should
have
his
nuggets
and
his
kit
returned
to
him
,
and
that
the
receipt
given
by
the
professors
together
with
professor
hanky
'
s
handkerchief
be
given
back
to
the
professors
.
"
furthermore
,
seeing
that
we
should
all
of
us
like
to
have
a
quiet
evening
with
the
prisoner
,
we
should
petition
the
mayor
and
mayoress
to
ask
him
to
meet
all
here
present
at
dinner
to
-
morrow
evening
,
after
his
discharge
,
on
the
plea
that
professors
hanky
and
panky
and
dr
downie
may
give
him
counsel
,
convince
him
of
his
folly
,
and
if
possible
free
him
henceforth
from
the
monomania
under
which
he
now
suffers
.
"
the
prisoner
shall
give
his
word
of
honour
,
never
to
return
to
erewhon
,
nor
to
encourage
any
of
his
countrymen
to
do
so
.
after
the
dinner
to
which
we
hope
the
mayoress
will
invite
us
,
the
ranger
,
if
the
night
is
fair
,
shall
escort
the
prisoner
as
far
as
the
statues
,
whence
he
will
find
his
own
way
home
.
"
those
who
are
in
favour
of
this
compromise
hold
up
their
hands
.
"
the
mayor
and
yram
held
up
theirs
.
"
will
you
hold
up
yours

hanky

said
george
,
"
if

"
"
yes
,
"
said
hanky
with
a
gruff
laugh
,
whereon
george
released
him
and
he
held
up
both
his
hands
.
panky
did
not
hold
up
his
,

hanky
said
,

are
really
very
well
out
of
it

"
panky
,
hardly
lifting
his
head
,
sobbed
out
,
"

"
i
am
afraid

,
"
said
george
,
"
that
the
prisoner
must
have
spent
the
greater
part
of
this
money
.
"
every
one
smiled
,
indeed
it
was
all
george
could
do
to
prevent
himself
from
laughing
outright
.
the
mayor
brought
out
his
purse
,
counted
the
money
,
and
handed
it
good
-
humouredly
to
panky
,
who
gratefully
received
it
,
and
said
he
would
divide
it
with
hanky
.
he
then
held
up
his
hands
,
"
but
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
his
brother
professor
,
"
so
long
as
i
live
,
hanky
,
i
will
never
go
out
anywhere
again
with
you
.
"
george
then
turned
to
hanky
and
said
,
"
i
am
afraid
i
must
now
trouble
you
and
professor
panky
to
depose
on
oath
to
the
facts
which
mrs
humdrum
and
dr
downie
propose
you
should
swear
to
in
open
court
to
-
morrow
.
i
knew
you
would
do
so
,
and
have
brought
an
ordinary
form
,
duly
filled
up
,
which
declares
that
the
prisoner
is
not
the
poacher
you
met
on
thursday
;
and
also
,
that
he
has
been
long
known
to
both
of
you
as
a
harmless
monomaniac
.
"
as
he
spoke
he
brought
out
depositions
to
the
above
effect
which
he
had
just
written
in
his
office
;
he
shewed
the
professors
that
the
form
was
this
time
an
innocent
one
,
whereon
they
made
no
demur
to
signing
and
swearing
in
the
presence
of
the
mayor
,
who
attested
.
"
the
former
depositions
,
"
said
hanky
,
"
had
better
be
destroyed
at
once
.
"
"
that
,
"
said
george
,
"
may
hardly
be
,
but
so
long
as
you
stick
to
what
you
have
just
sworn
to
,
they
will
not
be
used
against
you
.
"
hanky
scowled
,
but
knew
that
he
was
powerless
and
said
no
more
.
the
knowledge
of
what
ensued
did
not
reach
me
from
my
father
.
george
and
his
mother
,
seeing
how
ill
he
looked
,
and
what
a
shock
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
had
given
him
,
resolved
that
he
should
not
know
of
the
risk
that
george
was
about
to
run
;
they
therefore
said
nothing
to
him
about
it
.
what
i
shall
now
tell
,
i
learned
on
the
occasion
already
referred
to
when
i
had
the
happiness
to
meet
george
.
i
am
in
some
doubt
whether
it
is
more
fitly
told
here
,
or
when
i
come
to
the
interview
between
him
and
me
;
on
the
whole
,
however
,
i
suppose
chronological
order
is
least
outraged
by
dealing
with
it
here
.
as
soon
as
the
professors
had
signed
the
second
depositions
,
george
said
,
"
i
have
not
yet
held
up
my
hands
,
but
i
will
hold
them
up
if
mrs
humdrum
and
dr
downie
will
approve
of
what
i
propose
.
their
compromise
does
not
go
far
enough
,
for
swear
as
we
may
,
it
is
sure
to
get
noised
abroad
,
with
the
usual
exaggerations
,
that
the
sunchild
has
been
here
,
and
that
he
has
been
spirited
away
either
by
us
,
or
by
the
sun
his
father
.
for
one
person
whom
we
know
of
as
having
identified
him
,
there
will
be
five
,
of
whom
we
know
nothing
,
and
whom
we
cannot
square
.
reports
will
reach
the
king
sooner
or
later
,
and
i
shall
be
sent
for
.
meanwhile
the
professors
will
be
living
in
fear
of
intrigue
on
my
part
,
and
i
,
however
unreasonably
,
shall
fear
the
like
on
theirs
.
this
should
not
be
.
i
mean
,
therefore
,
on
the
day
following
my
return
from
escorting
the
prisoner
,
to
set
out
for
the
capital
,
see
the
king
,
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
matter
.
to
this
end
i
must
have
the
nuggets
,
the
prisoner
'
s
kit
,
his
receipt
,
professor
hanky
'
s
handkerchief

,
of
course
,
the
two
depositions
just
sworn
to
by
the
professors
.
i
hope
and
think
that
the
king
will
pardon
us
all
round
;
but
whatever
he
may
do
i
shall
tell
him
everything
.
"
hanky
was
up
in
arms
at
once
.
"
sheer
madness
,
"
he
exclaimed
.
yram
and
the
mayor
looked
anxious
;
dr
downie
eyed
george
as
though
he
were
some
curious
creature
,
which
he
heard
of
but
had
never
seen
,
and
was
rather
disposed
to
like
.
mrs
humdrum
nodded
her
head
approvingly
.
"
quite
right
,
george
,
"
said
she
,
"
tell
his
majesty
everything
.
"
dr
downie
then
said
,
"
your
son
,
mayoress
,
is
a
very
sensible
fellow
.
i
will
go
with
him
,
and
with
the
professors
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
they
had
better
come
too
:
each
will
hear
what
the
other
says
,
and
we
will
tell
the
truth
,
the
whole
truth
,
and
nothing
but
the
truth
.
i
am
,
as
you
know
,
a
persona
grata
at
court
;
i
will
say
that
i
advised
your
son
'
s
action
.
the
king
has
liked
him
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
,
and
i
am
not
much
afraid
about
what
he
will
do
.
in
public
,
no
doubt
we
had
better
hush
things
up
,
but
in
private
the
king
must
be
told
.
"
hanky
fought
hard
for
some
time
,
but
george
told
him
that
it
did
not
matter
whether
he
agreed
or
no
.
"
you
can
come
,
"
he
said
,
"
or
stop
away
,
just
as
you
please
.
if
you
come
,
you
can
hear
and
speak
;
if
you
do
not
,
you
will
not
hear
,
but
these
two
depositions
will
speak
for
you
.
please
yourself
.
"
"
very
well
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
"
i
suppose
we
had
better
go
.
"
every
one
having
now
understood
what
his
or
her
part
was
to
be
,
yram
said
they
had
better
shake
hands
all
round
and
take
a
couple
of
hours
'
rest
before
getting
ready
for
the
banquet
.
george
said
that
the
professors
did
not
shake
hands
with
him
very
cordially
,
but
the
farce
was
gone
through
.
when
the
hand
-
shaking
was
over
,
dr
downie
and
mrs
humdrum
left
the
house
,
and
the
professors
retired
grumpily
to
their
own
room
.
i
will
say
here
that
no
harm
happened
either
to
george
or
the
professors
in
consequence
of
his
having
told
the
king
,
but
will
reserve
particulars
for
my
concluding
chapter
.
yram
did
not
take
the
advice
she
had
given
her
guests
,
but
set
about
preparing
a
basket
of
the
best
cold
dainties
she
could
find
,
including
a
bottle
of
choice
wine
that
she
knew
my
father
would
like
;
thus
loaded
she
went
to
the
gaol
,
which
she
entered
by
her
father
'
s
private
entrance
.
it
was
now
about
half
-
past
four
,
so
that
much
more
must
have
been
said
and
done
after
luncheon
at
the
mayor
'
s
than
ever
reached
my
father
.
the
wonder
is
that
he
was
able
to
collect
so
much
.
he
,
poor
man
,
as
soon
as
george
left
him
,
flung
himself
on
to
the
bed
that
was
in
his
cell
and
lay
there
wakeful
,
but
not
unquiet
,
till
near
the
time
when
yram
reached
the
gaol
.
the
old
gaoler
came
to
tell
him
that
she
had
come
and
would
be
glad
to
see
him
;
much
as
he
dreaded
the
meeting
there
was
no
avoiding
it
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
yram
stood
before
him
.
both
were
agitated
,
but
yram
betrayed
less
of
what
she
felt
than
my
father
.
he
could
only
bow
his
head
and
cover
his
face
with
his
hands
.
yram
said
,
"
we
are
old
friends
;
take
your
hands
from
your
face
and
let
me
see
you
.
there
!
that
is
well
.
"
she
took
his
right
hand
between
both
hers
,
looked
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
kindness
,
and
said
softly
-
"
you
are
not
much
changed
,
but
you
look
haggard
,
worn
,
and
ill
;
i
am
uneasy
about
you
.
remember
,
you
are
among
friends
,
who
will
see
that
no
harm
befalls
you
.
there
is
a
look
in
your
eyes
that
frightens
me
.
"
as
she
spoke
she
took
the
wine
out
of
her
basket
,
and
poured
him
out
a
glass
,
but
rather
to
give
him
some
little
thing
to
distract
his
attention
,
than
because
she
expected
him
to
drink
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
which
he
could
not
do
.
she
never
asked
him
whether
he
found
her
altered
,
or
turned
the
conversation
ever
such
a
little
on
to
herself
;
all
was
for
him
;
to
soothe
and
comfort
him
,
not
in
words
alone
,
but
in
look
,
manner
,
and
voice
.
my
father
knew
that
he
could
thank
her
best
by
controlling
himself
,
and
letting
himself
be
soothed
and
comforted
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
at
any
rate
so
far
as
he
could
seem
to
be
.
up
to
this
time
they
had
been
standing
,
but
now
yram
,
seeing
my
father
calmer
,
said
,
"
enough
,
let
us
sit
down
.
"
so
saying
she
seated
herself
at
one
end
of
the
small
table
that
was
in
the
cell
,
and
motioned
my
father
to
sit
opposite
to
her
.
"
the
light
hurts
you
?
"
she
said
,
for
the
sun
was
coming
into
the
room
.
"
change
places
with
me
,
i
am
a
sun
worshipper
.
no
,
we
can
move
the
table
,
and
we
can
then
see
each
other
better
.
"
this
done
,
she
said
,
still
very
softly
,
"
and
now
tell
me
what
it
is
all
about
.
why
have
you
come
here
?
"
"
tell
me
first
,
"
said
my
father
,
"
what
befell
you
after
i
had
been
taken
away
.
why
did
you
not
send
me
word
when
you
found
what
had
happened
?
or
come
after
me
?
you
know
i
should
have
married
you
at
once
,
unless
they
bound
me
in
fetters
.
"
"
i
know
you
would
;
but
you
remember
mrs
humdrum
?
yes
,
i
see
you
do
.
i
told
her
everything
;
it
was
she
who
saved
me
.
we
thought
of
you
,
but
she
saw
that
it
would
not
do
.
as
i
was
to
marry
mr
strong
,
the
more
you
were
lost
sight
of
the
better
,
but
with
george
ever
with
me
i
have
not
been
able
to
forget
you
.
i
might
have
been
very
happy
with
you
,
but
i
could
not
have
been
happier
than
i
have
been
ever
since
that
short
dreadful
time
was
over
.
george
must
tell
you
the
rest
.
i
cannot
do
so

all
is
well

i
love
my
husband

my
whole
heart

his
.

knows
everything

george
is
his
son

yours

we
have
settled
it
so
,
though
we
both
know
otherwise
;
as
between
you
and
me
,
for
this
one
hour
,
here
,
there
is
no
use
in
pretending
that
you
are
not

father

i
have
said
all
i
need
say
.

asked
you

are
you
here

said
my
father
,
set
at
rest
by
the
sweetness
of
yram
'
s
voice
and
manner
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
told
me

had
never
seen
any
one
to
compare
with
her
except
my
mother

i
fear

to
do
as
much
harm
now

i
did
before
,
and
with
as
little
wish
to
do
any
harm
at
all
.
"
he
then
told
her
all
that
the
reader
knows
,
and
explained
how
he
had
thought
he
could
have
gone
about
the
country
as
a
peasant
,
and
seen
how
she
herself
had
fared
,
without
her
,
or
any
one
,
even
suspecting
that
he
was
in
the
country
.
"
you
say
your
wife

dead

she
left
you

dark

after
his
mother

is
handsome

good

talk
about
this
morning

you

yourself

"
"
i
do
not
know
what
i
meant

what
i
most
cared
about
was
the
doing
what
i
thought
george
would
wish
to
see
his
father
do
.
"
"
you
did
that

you

who
you
were
.
"
"
so
he
did
,
but
i
knew
what
he
would
think
right

was
uppermost
in
my
thoughts
all
the
time

yram
smiled
,
and
said
,
"
george

a
dangerous
person

you

foolish

bad

is
beyond
me

at
peace
about
it

shall
do
the
like
again
to

morrow
before
the
mayor

"
i
heartily
hope
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
.
george
tells
me
you
have
promised
him
to
be
good
and
to
do
as
we
bid
you
.
"
"
so
i
will
;

he
will
not
tell
me
to
say
that
i
am
not
what
i
am

"
"
yes
,
he
will
,

i
will
tell
you
why
.
if
we
permit
you
to
be
higgs
the
sunchild
,
he
must
either
throw
his
own
father
into
the
blue
pool
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
which
he
will
not
do
.
.
.
.
.
.
.

run
great
risk
of
being
thrown
into
it
himself
,
for
not
having
blue

pooled
a
foreigner

am
afraid

shall
have
to
make
you

a
good
deal

neither
you

we
shall
like

"
she
then
told
him
briefly
of
what
had
passed
after
luncheon
at
her
house
,
and
what
it
had
been
settled
to
do
,
leaving
george
to
tell
the
details
while
escorting
him
towards
the
statues
on
the
following
evening
.
she
said
that
every
one
would
be
so
completely
in
every
one
else
'
s
power
that
there
was
no
fear
of
any
one
'
s
turning
traitor
.

she
said
nothing
about
george
'
s
intention
of
setting
out
for
the
capital
on
wednesday
morning
to
tell
the
whole
story
to
the
king
.
"
now
,
"
she
said
,
when
she
had
told
him
as
much
as
was
necessary
,
"
be
good
,

do
as
you
said

would

"
i
will

will
deny
myself

once

twice

as
often
as
is
necessary

will
kiss
the
reliquary

when
i
meet
hanky

my
father
,
knowing
that
he
might
not
have
another
chance
of
seeing
yram
alone
,
now
changed
the
conversation
.
"
i
have
something

he
said
,

for
george

he
must
know
nothing
about
it
till
after
i
am
gone

as
he
spoke
,
he
took
from
his
pockets
the
nine
small
bags
of
nuggets
that
remained
to
him
.
"
but
this
,
"
said
yram
,
"
being
gold
,
is
a
large
sum
:
can
you
indeed
spare
it
,
and
do
you
really
wish
george
to
have
it
all
?
"
"
i
shall
be
very
unhappy

know
nothing
about
it
till
i
am
out

"
my
father
then
explained
to
her
that
he
was
now
very
rich
,
and
would
have
brought
ten
times
as
much
,
if
he
had
known
of
george
'
s
existence
.
"
then
,
"
said
yram
,
musing
,
"
if
you
are
rich
,
i
accept
and
thank
you
heartily
on
his
behalf
.
i
can
see
a
reason
for
his
not
knowing
what
you
are
giving
him
at
present
,
but
it
is
too
long
to
tell
.
"
the
reason
was
,
that
if
george
knew
of
this
gold
before
he
saw
the
king
,
he
would
be
sure
to
tell
him
of
it
,
and
the
king
might
claim
it
,
for
george
would
never
explain
that
it
was
a
gift
from
father
to
son
;
whereas
if
the
king
had
once
pardoned
him
,
he
would
not
be
so
squeamish
as
to
open
up
the
whole
thing
again
with
a
postscript
to
his
confession
.
but
of
this
she
said
not
a
word
.
my
father
then
told
her
of
the
box
of
sovereigns
that
he
had
left
in
his
saddle
-
bags
.
"
they
are
coined
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
george
will
have
to
melt
them
down
,
but
he
will
find
some
way
of
doing
this
.
they
will
be
worth
rather
more
than
these
nine
bags
of
nuggets
.
"
"
the
difficulty
will
be
to
get
him
to
go
down
and
fetch
them
,
for
it
is
against
his
oath
to
go
far
beyond
the
statues
.
if
you
could
be
taken
faint
and
say
you
wanted
help
,
he
would
see
you
to
your
camping
ground
without
a
word
,
but
he
would
be
angry
if
he
found
he
had
been
tricked
into
breaking
his
oath
in
order
that
money
might
be
given
him
.
it
would
never
do
.
besides
,
there
would
not
be
time

he
must
be
back
here
on
tuesday
night

breaks
his
oath

it

married
for

must
tell
you
how
i
will
hide
them
.
they
are
in
a
silver
box
,
which
i
will
bind
to
the
bough
of
some
tree
close
to
my
camp

i
can
find
a
tree
with
a
hole
in
it
i
will
drop
the
box
into
the
hole
.
he
cannot
miss
my
camp
;
he
has
only
to
follow
the
stream
that
runs
down
from
the
pass
till
it
gets
near
a
large
river
,
and
on
a
small
triangular
patch
of
flat
ground
,
he
will
see
the
ashes
of
my
camp
fire
,
a
few
yards
away
from
the
stream
on
his
right
hand
as
he
descends
.
in
whatever
tree
i
may
hide
the
box
,
i
will
strew
wood
ashes
for
some
yards
in
a
straight
line
towards
it

i
will
then
light
another
fire
underneath
,

blaze
the
tree
with
a
knife
that
i
have
left
at
my
camping
ground

is
sure
to
find
it
.
"
yram
again
thanked
him
,
and
then
my
father
,
to
change
the
conversation
,
asked
whether
she
thought
that
george
really
would
have
blue
-
pooled
the
professors
.
"
there
is
no
knowing
,
"
said
yram
.
"
he
is
the
gentlest
creature
living
till
some
great
provocation
rouses
him
,
and
i
never
saw
him
hate
and
despise
any
one
as
he
does
the
professors
.
much
of
what
he
said
was
merely
put
on
,
for
he
knew
the
professors
must
yield
.
i
do
not
like
his
ever
having
to
throw
any
one
into
that
horrid
place
,
no
more
does
he
,
but
the
rangership
is
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
to
suit
him
,
and
the
opening
was
too
good
to
lose
.

must
now
leave
you

ready

"
she
put
out
her
hand
,
which
my
father
took
,
and
in
another
moment
she
was
gone
,
for
she
saw
a
look
in
his
face
as
though
he
would
fain
have
asked
her
to
let
him
once
more
press
his
lips
to
hers
.
had
he
done
this
,
without
thinking
about
it
,
it
is
likely
enough
she
would
not
have
been
ill
pleased
.
but
who
can
say
?
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
my
father
was
left
very
much
to
his
own
not
too
comfortable
reflections
.
he
spent
part
of
it
in
posting
up
the
notes
from
which
,
as
well
as
from
his
own
mouth
,
my
story
is
in
great
part
taken
.
the
good
things
that
yram
had
left
with
him
,
and
his
pipe
,
which
she
had
told
him
he
might
smoke
quite
freely
,
occupied
another
part
,
and
by
ten
o
'
clock
he
went
to
bed
.
while
my
father
was
thus
wiling
away
the
hours
in
his
cell
,
the
whole
town
was
being
illuminated
in
his
honour
,
and
not
more
than
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
off
,
at
the
mayor
'
s
banquet
,
he
was
being
extolled
as
a
superhuman
being
.
the
banquet
,
which
was
at
the
town
hall
,
was
indeed
a
very
brilliant
affair
,
but
the
little
space
that
is
left
me
forbids
my
saying
more
than
that
hanky
made
what
was
considered
the
speech
of
the
evening
,
and
betrayed
no
sign
of
ill
effects
from
the
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
which
he
had
spent
so
recently
.
not
a
trace
was
to
be
seen
of
any
desire
on
his
part
to
change
his
tone
as
regards
sunchildism
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
,
for
example
,
to
minimize
the
importance
of
the
relic
,
or
to
remind
his
hearers
that
though
the
chariot
and
horses
had
undoubtedly
come
down
from
the
sky
and
carried
away
my
father
and
mother
,
yet
that
the
earlier
stage
of
the
ascent
had
been
made
in
a
balloon
.
it
almost
seemed
,
so
george
told
my
father
,
as
though
he
had
resolved
that
he
would
speak
lies
,
all
lies
,
and
nothing
but
lies
.
panky
,
who
was
also
to
have
spoken
,
was
excused
by
the
mayor
on
the
ground
that
the
great
heat
and
the
excitement
of
the
day
'
s
proceedings
had
quite
robbed
him
of
his
voice
.
dr
downie
had
a
jumping
cat
before
his
mental
vision
.
he
spoke
quietly
and
sensibly
,
dwelling
chiefly
on
the
benefits
that
had
already
accrued
to
the
kingdom
through
the
abolition
of
the
edicts
against
machinery
,
and
the
great
developments
which
he
foresaw
as
probable
in
the
near
future
.
he
held
up
the
sunchild
'
s
example
,
and
his
ethical
teaching
,
to
the
imitation
and
admiration
of
his
hearers
,
but
he
said
nothing
about
the
miraculous
element
in
my
father
'
s
career
,
on
which
he
declared
that
his
friend
professor
hanky
had
already
so
eloquently
enlarged
as
to
make
further
allusion
to
it
superfluous
.
the
reader
knows
what
was
to
happen
on
the
following
morning
.
the
programme
concerted
at
the
mayor
'
s
was
strictly
adhered
to
.
the
following
account
,
however
,
which
appeared
in
the
sunch
'
ston
bi
-
weekly
newspaper
two
days
after
my
father
had
left
,
was
given
me
by
george
a
year
later
,
on
the
occasion
of
that
interview
to
which
i
have
already
more
than
once
referred
.
there
were
other
accounts
in
other
papers
,
but
the
one
i
am
giving
departs
the
least
widely
from
the
facts
.
it
ran
:
-
"
the
close
of
a
disagreeable
incident
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
our
readers
will
remember
that
on
sunday
last
during
the
solemn
inauguration
of
the
temple
now
dedicated
to
the
sunchild
,
an
individual
on
the
front
bench
of
those
set
apart
for
the
public
suddenly
interrupted
professor
hanky
'
s
eloquent
sermon
by
declaring
himself
to
be
the
sunchild
,
and
saying
that
he
had
come
down
from
the
sun
to
sanctify
by
his
presence
the
glorious
fane
which
the
piety
of
our
fellow
-
citizens
and
others
has
erected
in
his
honour
.
"
wild
rumours
obtained
credence
throughout
the
congregation
to
the
effect
that
this
person
was
none
other
than
the
sunchild
himself
,
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
his
complexion
and
the
colour
of
his
hair
showed
this
to
be
impossible
,
more
than
one
person
was
carried
away
by
the
excitement
of
the
moment
,
and
by
some
few
points
of
resemblance
between
the
stranger
and
the
sunchild
.
under
the
influence
of
this
belief
,
they
were
preparing
to
give
him
the
honour
which
they
supposed
justly
due
to
him
,
when
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
he
was
taken
into
custody
by
the
deservedly
popular
ranger
of
the
king
'
s
preserves
,
and
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
it
became
generally
known
that
he
had
been
arrested
on
the
charge
of
being
one
of
a
gang
of
poachers
who
have
been
known
for
some
time
past
to
be
making
much
havoc
among
the
quails
on
the
preserves
.
"
this
offence
,
at
all
times
deplored
by
those
who
desire
that
his
majesty
should
enjoy
good
sport
when
he
honours
us
with
a
visit
,
is
doubly
deplorable
during
the
season
when
,
on
the
higher
parts
of
the
preserves
,
the
young
birds
are
not
yet
able
to
shift
for
themselves
;
the
ranger
,
therefore
,
is
indefatigable
in
his
efforts
to
break
up
the
gang
,
and
with
this
end
in
view
,
for
the
last
fortnight
has
been
out
night
and
day
on
the
remoter
sections
of
the
forest
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
little
suspecting
that
the
marauders
would
venture
so
near
sunch
'
ston
as
it
now
seems
they
have
done
.
it
is
to
his
extreme
anxiety
to
detect
and
punish
these
miscreants
that
we
must
ascribe
the
arrest
of
a
man
,
who
,
however
foolish
,
and
indeed
guilty
,
he
is
in
other
respects
,
is
innocent
of
the
particular
crime
imputed
to
him
.
the
circumstances
that
led
to
his
arrest
have
reached
us
from
an
exceptionally
well
-
informed
source
,
and
are
as
follows
:
-
"
our
distinguished
guests
,
professors
hanky
and
panky
,
both
of
them
justly
celebrated
archaeologists
,
had
availed
themselves
of
the
opportunity
afforded
them
by
their
visit
to
sunch
'
ston
,
to
inspect
the
mysterious
statues
at
the
head
of
the
stream
that
comes
down
near
this
city
,
and
which
have
hitherto
baffled
all
those
who
have
tried
to
ascertain
their
date
and
purpose
.
"
on
their
descent
after
a
fatiguing
day
the
professors
were
benighted
,
and
lost
their
way
.
seeing
the
light
of
a
small
fire
among
some
trees
near
them
,
they
made
towards
it
,
hoping
to
be
directed
rightly
,
and
found
a
man
,
respectably
dressed
,
sitting
by
the
fire
with
several
brace
of
quails
beside
him
,
some
of
them
plucked
.
believing
that
in
spite
of
his
appearance
,
which
would
not
have
led
them
to
suppose
that
he
was
a
poacher
,
he
must
unquestionably
be
one
,
they
hurriedly
enquired
their
way
,
intending
to
leave
him
as
soon
as
they
had
got
their
answer
;
he
,
however
,
attacked
them
,
or
made
as
though
he
would
do
so
,
and
said
he
would
show
them
a
way
which
they
should
be
in
no
fear
of
losing
,
whereon
professor
hanky
,
with
a
well
-
directed
blow
,
felled
him
to
the
ground
.
the
two
professors
,
fearing
that
other
poachers
might
come
to
his
assistance
,
made
off
as
nearly
as
they
could
guess
in
the
direction
of
sunch
'
ston
.
when
they
had
gone
a
mile
or
two
onward
at
haphazard
,
they
sat
down
under
a
large
tree
,
and
waited
till
day
began
to
break
;
they
then
resumed
their
journey
,
and
before
long
struck
a
path
which
led
them
to
a
spot
from
which
they
could
see
the
towers
of
the
new
temple
.
"
fatigued
though
they
were
,
they
waited
before
taking
the
rest
of
which
they
stood
much
in
need
,
till
they
had
reported
their
adventure
at
the
ranger
'
s
office
.
the
ranger
was
still
out
on
the
preserves
,
but
immediately
on
his
return
on
saturday
morning
he
read
the
description
of
the
poacher
'
s
appearance
and
dress
,
about
which
last
,
however
,
the
only
remarkable
feature
was
that
it
was
better
than
a
poacher
might
be
expected
to
possess
,
and
gave
an
air
of
respectability
to
the
wearer
that
might
easily
disarm
suspicion
.
"
the
ranger
made
enquiries
at
all
the
inns
in
sunch
'
ston
,
and
at
length
succeeded
in
hearing
of
a
stranger
who
appeared
to
correspond
with
the
poacher
whom
the
professors
had
seen
;
but
the
man
had
already
left
,
and
though
the
ranger
did
his
best
to
trace
him
he
did
not
succeed
.
on
sunday
morning
,
however
,
he
observed
the
prisoner
,
and
found
that
he
answered
the
description
given
by
the
professors
;
he
therefore
arrested
him
quietly
in
the
temple
,
but
told
him
that
he
should
not
take
him
to
prison
till
the
service
was
over
.
the
man
said
he
would
come
quietly
inasmuch
as
he
should
easily
be
able
to
prove
his
innocence
.
in
the
meantime
,
however
,
he
professed
the
utmost
anxiety
to
hear
professor
hanky
'
s
sermon
,
which
he
said
he
believed
would
concern
him
nearly
.
the
ranger
paid
no
attention
to
this
,
and
was
as
much
astounded
as
the
rest
of
the
congregation
were
,
when
immediately
after
one
of
professor
hanky
'
s
most
eloquent
passages
,
the
man
started
up
and
declared
himself
to
be
the
sunchild
.
on
this
the
ranger
took
him
away
at
once
,
and
for
the
man
'
s
own
protection
hurried
him
off
to
prison
.
"
professor
hanky
was
so
much
shocked
at
such
outrageous
conduct
,
that
for
the
moment
he
failed
to
recognise
the
offender
;
after
a
few
seconds
,
however
,
he
grasped
the
situation
,
and
knew
him
to
be
one
who
on
previous
occasions
,
near
bridgeford
,
had
done
what
he
was
now
doing
.
it
seems
that
he
is
notorious
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bridgeford
,
as
a
monomaniac
who
is
so
deeply
impressed
with
the
beauty
of
the
sunchild
'
s
character
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
we
presume
also
of
his
own
-
-
as
to
believe
that
he
is
himself
the
sunchild
.
"
recovering
almost
instantly
from
the
shock
the
interruption
had
given
him
,
the
learned
professor
calmed
his
hearers
by
acquainting
them
with
the
facts
of
the
case
,
and
continued
his
sermon
to
the
delight
of
all
who
heard
it
.
we
should
say
,
however
,
that
the
gentleman
who
twenty
years
ago
instructed
the
sunchild
in
the
erewhonian
language
,
was
so
struck
with
some
few
points
of
resemblance
between
the
stranger
,
and
his
former
pupil
,
that
he
acclaimed
him
,
and
was
removed
forcibly
by
the
vergers
.
"
on
monday
morning
the
prisoner
was
brought
up
before
the
mayor
.
we
cannot
say
whether
it
was
the
sobering
effect
of
prison
walls
,
or
whether
he
had
been
drinking
before
he
entered
the
temple
,
and
had
now
had
time
enough
to
recover
himself
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
at
any
rate
for
some
reason
or
other
he
was
abjectly
penitent
when
his
case
came
on
for
hearing
.
the
charge
of
poaching
was
first
gone
into
,
but
was
immediately
disposed
of
by
the
evidence
of
the
two
professors
,
who
stated
that
the
prisoner
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
poacher
they
had
seen
,
save
that
he
was
about
the
same
height
and
age
,
and
was
respectably
dressed
.
"
the
charge
of
disturbing
the
congregation
by
declaring
himself
the
sunchild
was
then
proceeded
with
,
and
unnecessary
as
it
may
appear
to
be
,
it
was
thought
advisable
to
prevent
all
possibility
of
the
man
'
s
assertion
being
accepted
by
the
ignorant
as
true
,
at
some
later
date
,
when
those
who
could
prove
its
falsehood
were
no
longer
living
.
the
prisoner
,
therefore
,
was
removed
to
his
cell
,
and
there
measured
by
the
master
of
the
gaol
,
and
the
ranger
in
the
presence
of
the
mayor
,
who
attested
the
accuracy
of
the
measurements
.
not
one
single
one
of
them
corresponded
with
those
recorded
of
the
sunchild
himself
,
and
a
few
marks
such
as
moles
,
and
permanent
scars
on
the
sunchild
'
s
body
were
not
found
on
the
prisoner
'
s
.
furthermore
the
prisoner
was
shaggy
-
breasted
,
with
much
coarse
jet
black
hair
on
the
fore
-
arms
and
from
the
knees
downwards
,
whereas
the
sunchild
had
little
hair
save
on
his
head
,
and
what
little
there
was
,
was
fine
,
and
very
light
in
colour
.
"
confronted
with
these
discrepancies
,
the
gentleman
who
had
taught
the
sunchild
our
language
was
convinced
of
his
mistake
,
though
he
still
maintained
that
there
was
some
superficial
likeness
between
his
former
pupil
and
the
prisoner
.
here
he
was
confirmed
by
the
master
of
the
gaol
,
the
mayoress
,
mrs
humdrum
,
and
professors
hanky
and
panky
,
who
all
of
them
could
see
what
the
interpreter
meant
,
but
denied
that
the
prisoner
could
be
mistaken
for
the
sunchild
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
.
no
doubt
the
prisoner
'
s
unhappy
delusion
has
been
fostered
,
if
not
entirely
caused
,
by
his
having
been
repeatedly
told
that
he
was
like
the
sunchild
.
the
celebrated
dr
downie
,
who
well
remembers
the
sunchild
,
was
also
examined
,
and
gave
his
evidence
with
so
much
convincing
detail
as
to
make
it
unnecessary
to
call
further
witnesses
.
"
it
having
been
thus
once
for
all
officially
and
authoritatively
placed
on
record
that
the
prisoner
was
not
the
sunchild
,
professors
hanky
and
panky
then
identified
him
as
a
well
known
monomaniac
on
the
subject
of
sunchildism
,
who
in
other
respects
was
harmless
.
we
withhold
his
name
and
place
of
abode
,
out
of
consideration
for
the
well
known
and
highly
respectable
family
to
which
he
belongs
.
the
prisoner
admitted
with
much
contrition
that
he
had
made
a
disturbance
in
the
temple
,
but
pleaded
that
he
had
been
carried
away
by
the
eloquence
of
professor
hanky
;
he
promised
to
avoid
all
like
offence
in
future
,
and
threw
himself
on
the
mercy
of
the
court
.

mayor

that
sunday

memorable
ceremony
should
