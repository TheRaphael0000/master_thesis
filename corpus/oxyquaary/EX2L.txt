'
o
avice
he
cried
with
the
tenderly
subdued
scolding
of
a
mother
what
is
this
you
have
done
to
alarm
me
so
she
seemed
unconscious
of
having
done
anything
and
was
altogether
surprised
at
his
anxiety
in
his
relief
he
did
not
speak
further
till
he
asked
her
suddenly
if
she
would
take
his
arm
since
she
must
be
tired
'
o
no
sir
she
assured
him
i
am
not
a
bit
tired
and
i
do
not
require
any
help
at
all
thank
you
they
went
upstairs
without
using
the
lift
and
he
let
her
and
himself
in
with
his
latchkey
she
entered
the
kitchen
and
he
following
sat
down
in
a
chair
there
'
where
have
you
been
he
said
with
almost
angered
concern
on
his
face
you
ought
not
to
have
been
absent
more
than
ten
minutes
'
i
knew
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
and
thought
i
should
like
to
see
a
little
of
london
she
replied
naively
so
when
i
had
got
the
stamps
i
went
on
into
the
fashionable
streets
where
ladies
are
all
walking
about
just
as
if
it
were
daytime
twas
for
all
the
world
like
coming
home
by
night
from
martinmas
fair
at
the
street
o
'
wells
only
more
genteel
'
o
avice
avice
you
must
not
go
out
like
this
do
not
you
know
that
i
am
responsible
for
your
safety
i
am
your
well
guardian
in
fact
and
am
bound
by
law
and
morals
and
i
do
not
know
what
-
all
to
deliver
you
up
to
your
native
island
without
a
scratch
or
blemish
and
yet
you
indulge
in
such
a
midnight
vagary
as
this
'
but
i
am
sure
sir
the
gentlemen
in
the
street
were
more
respectable
than
they
are
anywhere
at
home
they
were
dressed
in
the
latest
fashion
and
would
have
scorned
to
do
me
any
harm
and
as
to
their
love
-
making
i
never
heard
anything
so
polite
before
'
well
you
must
not
do
it
again
i
will
tell
you
some
day
why
what
'
s
that
you
have
in
your
hand
'
a
mouse
-
trap
there
are
lots
of
mice
in
this
kitchen
sooty
mice
not
clean
like
ours
and
i
thought
i
'
d
try
to
catch
them
that
was
what
i
went
so
far
to
buy
as
there
were
no
shops
open
just
about
here
i
will
set
it
now
she
proceeded
at
once
to
do
so
and
pierston
remained
in
his
seat
regarding
the
operation
which
seemed
entirely
to
engross
her
it
was
extraordinary
indeed
to
observe
how
she
wilfully
limited
her
interests
with
what
content
she
received
the
ordinary
things
that
life
offered
and
persistently
refused
to
behold
what
an
infinitely
extended
life
lay
open
to
her
through
him
if
she
had
only
said
the
word
he
would
have
got
a
licence
and
married
her
the
next
morning
was
it
possible
that
she
did
not
perceive
this
tendency
in
him
she
could
hardly
be
a
woman
if
she
did
not
and
in
her
airy
elusive
offhand
demeanour
she
was
very
much
of
a
woman
indeed
'
it
only
holds
one
mouse
he
said
absently
'
but
i
shall
hear
it
throw
in
the
night
and
set
it
again
he
sighed
and
left
her
to
her
own
resources
and
retired
to
rest
though
he
felt
no
tendency
to
sleep
at
some
small
hour
of
the
darkness
owing
possibly
to
some
intervening
door
being
left
open
he
heard
the
mouse
-
trap
click
another
light
sleeper
must
have
heard
it
too
for
almost
immediately
after
the
pit
-
pat
of
naked
feet
accompanied
by
the
brushing
of
drapery
was
audible
along
the
passage
towards
the
kitchen
after
her
absence
in
that
apartment
long
enough
to
reset
the
trap
he
was
startled
by
a
scream
from
the
same
quarter
pierston
sprang
out
of
bed
jumped
into
his
dressing
-
gown
and
hastened
in
the
direction
of
the
cry
avice
barefooted
and
wrapped
in
a
shawl
was
standing
in
a
chair
the
mouse
-
trap
lay
on
the
floor
the
mouse
running
round
and
round
in
its
neighbourhood
'
i
was
trying
to
take
en
out
said
she
excitedly
and
he
got
away
from
me
pierston
secured
the
mouse
while
she
remained
standing
on
the
chair
then
having
set
the
trap
anew
his
feeling
burst
out
petulantly
'
a
girl
like
you
to
throw
yourself
away
upon
such
a
commonplace
fellow
as
that
quarryman
why
do
you
do
it
her
mind
was
so
intently
fixed
upon
the
matter
in
hand
that
it
was
some
moments
before
she
caught
his
irrelevant
subject
because
i
am
a
foolish
girl
she
said
quietly
'
what
do
not
you
love
him
said
jocelyn
with
a
surprised
stare
up
at
her
as
she
stood
in
her
concern
appearing
the
very
avice
who
had
kissed
him
twenty
years
earlier
'
it
is
not
much
use
to
talk
about
that
said
she
'
then
is
it
the
soldier
'
yes
though
i
have
never
spoken
to
him
'
never
spoken
to
the
soldier
'
never
'
has
either
one
treated
you
badly
deceived
you
'
no
certainly
not
'
well
i
ca
not
make
you
out
and
i
do
not
wish
to
know
more
than
you
choose
to
tell
me
come
avice
why
not
tell
me
exactly
how
things
are
'
not
now
sir
she
said
her
pretty
pink
face
and
brown
eyes
turned
in
simple
appeal
to
him
from
her
pedestal
i
will
tell
you
all
to
-
morrow
an
that
i
will
he
retreated
to
his
own
room
and
lay
down
meditating
some
quarter
of
an
hour
after
she
had
retreated
to
hers
the
mouse
-
trap
clicked
again
and
pierston
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
to
listen
the
place
was
so
still
and
the
jerry
-
built
door
-
panels
so
thin
that
he
could
hear
the
mouse
jumping
about
inside
the
wires
of
the
trap
but
he
heard
no
footstep
this
time
as
he
was
wakeful
and
restless
he
again
arose
proceeded
to
the
kitchen
with
a
light
and
removing
the
mouse
reset
the
trap
returning
he
listened
once
more
he
could
see
in
the
far
distance
the
door
of
avice
'
s
room
but
that
thoughtful
housewife
had
not
heard
the
second
capture
from
the
room
came
a
soft
breathing
like
that
of
an
infant
he
entered
his
own
chamber
and
reclined
himself
gloomily
enough
her
lack
of
all
consciousness
of
him
the
aspect
of
the
deserted
kitchen
the
cold
grate
impressed
him
with
a
deeper
sense
of
loneliness
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
foolish
he
was
indeed
to
be
so
devoted
to
this
young
woman
her
defencelessness
her
freedom
from
the
least
thought
that
there
lurked
a
danger
in
their
propinquity
were
in
fact
secondary
safeguards
not
much
less
strong
than
that
of
her
being
her
mother
'
s
image
against
risk
to
her
from
him
yet
it
was
out
of
this
that
his
depression
came
at
sight
of
her
the
next
morning
pierston
felt
that
he
must
put
an
end
to
such
a
state
of
things
he
sent
avice
off
to
the
studio
wrote
to
an
agent
for
a
couple
of
servants
and
then
went
round
to
his
work
avice
was
busy
righting
all
that
she
was
allowed
to
touch
it
was
the
girl
'
s
delight
to
be
occupied
among
the
models
and
casts
which
for
the
first
time
she
regarded
with
the
wistful
interest
of
a
soul
struggling
to
receive
ideas
of
beauty
vaguely
discerned
yet
ever
eluding
her
that
brightness
in
her
mother
'
s
mind
which
might
have
descended
to
the
second
avice
with
the
maternal
face
and
form
had
been
dimmed
by
admixture
with
the
mediocrity
of
her
father
'
s
and
by
one
who
remembered
like
pierston
the
dual
organization
the
opposites
could
be
often
seen
wrestling
internally
they
were
alone
in
the
studio
and
his
feelings
found
vent
putting
his
arms
round
her
he
said
my
darling
sweet
little
avice
i
want
to
ask
you
something
surely
you
guess
what
i
want
to
know
this
will
you
be
married
to
me
and
live
here
with
me
always
and
ever
'
o
mr
pierston
what
nonsense
'
nonsense
said
he
shrinking
somewhat
'
yes
sir
'
well
why
am
i
too
old
surely
there
'
s
no
serious
difference
'
o
no
i
should
not
mind
that
if
it
came
to
marrying
the
difference
is
not
much
for
husband
and
wife
though
it
is
rather
much
for
keeping
company
she
struggled
to
get
free
and
when
in
the
movement
she
knocked
down
the
empress
faustina
'
s
head
he
did
not
try
to
retain
her
he
saw
that
she
was
not
only
surprised
but
a
little
alarmed
'
you
have
not
said
why
it
is
nonsense
he
remarked
tartly
'
why
i
did
not
know
you
was
thinking
of
me
like
that
i
had
not
any
thought
of
it
and
all
alone
here
what
shall
i
do
'
say
yes
my
pretty
avice
we
will
then
go
out
and
be
married
at
once
and
nobody
be
any
the
wiser
she
shook
her
head
i
could
not
sir
'
it
would
be
well
for
you
you
do
not
like
me
perhaps
'
yes
i
do
very
much
but
not
in
that
sort
of
way
quite
still
i
might
have
got
to
love
you
in
time
if
'
well
then
try
he
said
warmly
your
mother
did
no
sooner
had
the
words
slipped
out
than
pierston
would
have
recalled
them
he
had
felt
in
a
moment
that
they
jeopardized
his
cause
'
mother
loved
you
said
avice
incredulously
gazing
at
him
'
yes
he
murmured
'
you
were
not
her
false
young
man
surely
that
one
who
'
yes
yes
say
no
more
about
it
'
who
ran
away
from
her
'
almost
'
then
i
can
never
never
like
you
again
i
did
not
know
it
was
a
gentleman
i
i
thought
'
it
was
not
a
gentleman
then
'
o
sir
please
go
away
i
ca
not
bear
the
sight
of
'
ee
at
this
moment
perhaps
i
shall
get
to
to
like
you
as
i
did
but
'
no
i
am
d
-
d
if
i
will
go
away
said
pierston
thoroughly
irritated
i
have
been
candid
with
you
you
ought
to
be
the
same
with
me
'
what
do
you
want
me
to
tell
'
enough
to
make
it
clear
to
me
why
you
do
not
accept
this
offer
everything
you
have
said
yet
is
a
reason
for
the
reverse
now
my
dear
i
am
not
angry
'
yes
you
are
'
no
i
am
not
now
what
is
your
reason
'
the
name
of
it
is
isaac
pierston
down
home
'
how
'
i
mean
he
courted
me
and
led
me
on
to
island
custom
and
then
i
went
to
chapel
one
morning
and
married
him
in
secret
because
mother
did
not
care
about
him
and
i
did
not
either
by
that
time
and
then
he
quarrelled
with
me
and
just
before
you
and
i
came
to
london
he
went
away
to
guernsey
then
i
saw
a
soldier
i
never
knew
his
name
but
i
fell
in
love
with
him
because
i
am
so
quick
at
that
still
as
it
was
wrong
i
tried
not
to
think
of
him
and
would
not
look
at
him
when
he
passed
but
it
made
me
cry
very
much
that
i
must
not
i
was
then
very
miserable
and
you
asked
me
to
come
to
london
i
did
not
care
what
i
did
with
myself
and
i
came
'
heaven
above
us
said
pierston
his
pale
and
distressed
face
showing
with
what
a
shock
this
announcement
had
come
why
have
you
done
such
extraordinary
things
or
rather
why
did
not
you
tell
me
of
this
before
then
at
the
present
moment
you
are
the
wife
of
a
man
who
is
in
guernsey
whom
you
do
not
love
at
all
but
instead
of
him
love
a
soldier
whom
you
have
never
spoken
to
while
i
have
nearly
brought
scandal
upon
us
both
by
your
letting
me
love
you
really
you
are
a
very
wicked
woman
'

pouted
still
avice
looked
pale
and
rather
frightened
and
did
not
lift
her
eyes
from
the
floor
i
said
it
was
nonsense
in
you
to
want
to
have
me
she
went
on
and
even
if
i
had
not
been
married
to
that
horrid
isaac
pierston
i
could
not
have
married
you
after
you
told
me
that
you
was
the
man
who
ran
away
from
my
mother
'
i
have
paid
the
penalty

said
sadly
men
of
my
sort
always
get
the
worst
of
it
somehow
though
i
never
did
your

any
harm
now

i
will
call
you
dear
avice
for
your

not
for

i
must
see
what
i
can
do
to
help
you
out
of
the
difficulty
that
unquestionably
you
are
in
why

love
your
husband

married
him
avice
looked
aside
at
the
statuary
as
if
the
subtleties
of
her
organization
were
not
very
easy
to
define
'
was
he
that
black
-
bearded
typical
local
character
i
saw
you
walking
with
one
sunday
the
same
surname
as
mine
though
of
course
you
do
not
notice
that
in
a
place
where
there
are
only
half
-
a
-
dozen
surnames
'
yes
that
was
ike
it
was
that
evening
we
disagreed
he
scolded
me
and
i
answered
him
(
you
must
have
heard
us
)
and
the
next
day
he
went
away
'
well
as
i
say
i
must
consider
what
it
will
be
best
to
do
for
you
in
this
the
first
thing
it
seems
to
me
will
be
to
get
your
husband
home
she
impatiently
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
do
not
like
him
'
then
why
did
you
marry
him
'
i
was
obliged
to
after
we
'
d
proved
each
other
by
island
custom
'
you
should
not
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
it
is
ridiculous
and
out
of
date
nowadays
'
ah
he
is
so
old
-
fashioned
in
his
notions
that
he
does
not
think
like
that
however
he
is
gone
'
ah
it
is
only
a
tiff
between
you
i
dare
say
i
will
start
him
in
business
if
he
will
come

the
cottage

back
there
you
go
straightway

to

up

she
found
it
was
no
use
to
disobey
precisely
at
the
moment
appointed
he
met
her
there
himself
burdened
only
with
a
valise
and
umbrella
she
with
a
box
and
other
things
directing
the
porter
to
put
avice
and
her
belongings
into
a
four
-
wheeled
cab
for
the
railway
-
station
he
walked
onward
from
the
door
and
kept
looking
behind
till
he
saw
the
cab
approaching
he
then
entered
beside
the
astonished
girl
and
onward
they
went
together
they
sat
opposite
each
other
in
an
empty
compartment
and
the
tedious
railway
journey
began
regarding
her
closely
now
by
the
light
of
her
revelation
he
wondered
at
himself
for
never
divining
her
secret
whenever
he
looked
at
her
the
girl
'
s
eyes
grew
rebellious
and
at
last
she
wept
'
i
do
not
want
to
go
to
him
she
sobbed
in
a
miserable
voice
pierston
was
almost
as
much
distressed
as
she
why
did
you
put
yourself
and
me
in
such
a
position
he
said
bitterly
it
is
no
use
to
regret
it
now
and
i
ca
not
say
that
i
do

me
a
way
out
of
a
trying
position

if
you

pierston
sighed
for
emotionally
he
was
not
much
older
than
she
that
hitch
in
his
development
rendering
him
the
most
lopsided
of
god
'
s
creatures
was
his
standing
misfortune
a
proposal
to
her
which
crossed
his
mind
was
dismissed
as
disloyalty
particularly
to
an
inexperienced
fellow
-
islander
and
one
who
was
by
race
and
traditions
almost
a
kinswoman
little
more
passed
between
the
twain
on
that
wretched

aphrodite
ashtaroth
freyja
or
whoever
the
love
-
queen
of
his
isle
might
have
been
was
punishing
him
sharply
as
she
knew
but
too
well
how
to
punish
her
votaries
when
they
reverted
from
the
ephemeral
to
the
stable
mood
when
was
it
to
end
this
curse
of
his
heart
not
ageing
while
his
frame
moved
naturally
onward
perhaps
only
with
life
his
first
act
the
day
after
depositing
her
in
her
own
house
was
to
go
to
the
chapel
where
by
her
statement
the
marriage
had
been
solemnized
and
make
sure
of
the
fact
perhaps
he
felt
an
illogical
hope
that
she
might
be
free
even
then
in
the
tarnished
condition
which
such
freedom
would
have
involved

there
stood
the
words
distinctly
isaac
pierston
ann

caro
son
and
daughter
of
so
-
and
-
so
married
on
such
a
day
signed
by
the
contracting
parties
the
officiating
minister
and
the
two
witnesses
one
evening
in
early
winter
when
the
air
was
dry
and
gusty
the
dark
little
lane
which
divided
the
grounds
of
sylvania
castle
from
the
cottage
of
avice
and
led
down
to
the
adjoining
ruin
of
red
-
king
castle
was
paced
by
a
solitary
man
the
cottage
was
the
centre
of
his
beat
its
western
limit
being
the
gates
of
the
former
residence
its
eastern
the
drawbridge
of
the
ruin

few
other
cottages
thereabout

as
if
carved
from
the
solid
rock
were
in
darkness
but
from
the
upper
window
of
avice
'
s
tiny
freehold
glimmered
a
light
its
rays
were
repeated
from
the
far
-
distant
sea
by
the
lightship
lying
moored
over
the
mysterious
shambles
quicksand
which
brought
tamelessness
and
domesticity
into
due
position
as
balanced
opposites
the
sea
moaned
more
than
moaned
among
the
boulders
below
the
ruins
a
throe
of
its
tide
being
timed
to
regular
intervals
these
sounds
were
accompanied
by
an
equally
periodic
moan
from
the
interior
of
the
cottage
chamber
so
that
the
articulate
heave
of
water
and
the
articulate
heave
of
life
seemed
but
differing
utterances
of
the
selfsame
troubled
terrestrial
being
which
in
one
sense
they
were
pierston
for
the
man
in
the
lane
was
he
would
look
from
lightship
to
cottage
window
then
back
again
as
he
waited
there
between
the
travail
of
the
sea
without
and
the
travail
of
the
woman
within
soon
an
infant
'
s
wail
of
the
very
feeblest
was
also
audible
in
the
house
he
started
from
his
easy
pacing
and
went
again
westward
standing
at
the
elbow
of
the
lane
a
long
time
then
the
peace
of
the
sleeping
village
which
lay
that
way
was
broken
by
light
wheels
and
the
trot
of
a
horse
pierston
went
back
to
the
cottage
gate
and
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
vehicle
it
was
a
light
cart
and
a
man
jumped
down
as
it
stopped
he
was
in
a
broad
-
brimmed
hat
under
which
no
more
of
him
could
be
perceived
than
that
he
wore
a
black
beard
clipped
like
a
yew
fence
a
typical
aspect
in
the
island
'
you
are
avice
'
s
husband
asked
the
sculptor
quickly
the
man
replied
that
he
was
in
the
local
accent
i
'
ve
just
come
in
by
to

added

contracted
for

had
to
see
to
'
t
to
the
end
'
well
said
pierston
your
coming
means
that
you
are
willing
to
make
it
up
with
her
'
ay
i

not

the

so
well

as
anything
else

if
you
do
thoroughly
a

your
old
line

you
here
in
the
island
'
wi
'
all
my

then
said
the
man
his
voice
was
energetic
and
though
slightly
touchy
it
showed
on
the
whole
a
disposition
to
set
things
right
the
driver
of
the
trap
was
paid
off
and
jocelyn
and
isaac
pierston
undoubtedly
scions
of
a
common
stock
in
this
isle
of
intermarriages
though
they
had
no
proof
of
it
entered
the
house
nobody
was
in
the
ground
-
floor
room
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
a
square
table
in
the
centre
of
the
table
a
little
wool
mat
and
in
the
centre
of
the
mat
a
lamp
the
apartment
having
the
appearance
of
being
rigidly
swept
and
set
in
order
for
an
event
of
interest
the
woman
who
lived
in
the
house
with
avice
now
came
downstairs
and
to
the
inquiry
of
the
comers
she
replied
that
matters
were
progressing
favourably
but
that
nobody
could
be
allowed
to
go
upstairs
just
then
after
placing
chairs
and
viands
for
them
she
retreated
and
they
sat
down
the
lamp
between
them
the
lover
of
the
sufferer
above
who
had
no
right
to
her
and
the
man
who
had
every
right
to
her
but
did
not
love
her
engaging
in
desultory
and
fragmentary
conversation
they
listened
to
the
trampling
of
feet
on
the
floor
-
boards
overhead
pierston
full
of
anxiety
and
attentiveness
ike
awaiting
the
course
of
nature
calmly
soon
they
heard
the
feeble
bleats
repeated
and
then
the
local
practitioner
descended
and
entered
the
room
'
how
is
she
now
said
pierston
the
more
taciturn
ike
looking
up
with
him
for
the
answer
that
he
felt
would
serve
for
two
as
well
as
for
one
'
doing
well
remarkably
well
replied
the
professional
gentleman
with
a
manner
of
having
said
it
in
other
places
and
his
vehicle
not
being
at
the
door
he
sat
down
and
shared
some
refreshment
with
the
others
when
he
had
departed
mrs
stockwool
again
stepped
down
and
informed
them
that
ike
'
s
presence
had
been
made
known
to
his
wife
the
truant
quarrier
seemed
rather
inclined
to
stay
where
he
was
and
finish
the
mug
of
ale
but
pierston
quickened
him
and
he
ascended
the
staircase
as
soon
as
the
lower
room
was
empty
pierston
leant
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
ike
was
absent
no
great
time
descending
with
a
proprietary
mien
that
had
been
lacking
before
he
invited
jocelyn
to
ascend
likewise
since
she
had
stated
that
she
would
like
to
see
him
jocelyn
went
up
the
crooked
old
steps
the
husband
remaining
below
avice
though
white
as
the
sheets
looked
brighter
and
happier
than
he
had
expected
to
find
her
and
was
apparently
very
much
fortified
by
the
pink
little
lump
at
her
side
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
'
i
just
wanted
to
tell
'
ee
she
said
striving
against
her
feebleness
i
thought
it
would
be
no
harm
to
see
you
though
'
tis
rather
soon
to
tell
'
ee
how
very
much
i
thank
you
for
getting
me
settled
again
with
ike
he
is
very
glad
to
come
home
again
too
he
says
yes
you
'

done
a
good
many
kind
things
for
me
sir
whether
she
were
really
glad
or
whether
the
words
were
expressed
as
a
matter
of
duty
pierston
did
not
attempt
to
learn
he
merely
said
that
he
valued
her
thanks
now
avice
he
added
tenderly
i
resign
my
guardianship
of
you
i
hope
to
see
your
husband
in
a
sound
little
business

very
short
time

some
timidity

the

he
was
to

again
under
very
altered
conditions

here
endeth
that
dream

he
hymen
in
secret
or
overt
guise
seemed
to
haunt
pierston
just
at
this
time
with
undignified
mockery
which
savoured
rather
of
harlequin
than
of
the
torch
-
bearer
two
days
after
parting
in
a
lone
island
from
the
girl
he
had
so
disinterestedly
loved
he
met
in
piccadilly
his
friend
somers
wonderfully
spruced
up
and
hastening
along
with
a
preoccupied
face
'
my
dear
fellow
said
somers
what
do
you
think
i
was
charged
not
to
tell
you
but
hang
it
i
may
just
as
well
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
now
as
later

you
are
not

pierston
with
divination
'
yes
what
i
said
on
impulse
six
months
back
i
am
about
to
carry
out
in
cold
blood

and
i
began
in
jest
and
ended
in
earnest
we
are
going
to
take
one
another
next
month
for
good
and
all
twenty
years
had
spread
their
films
over
the
events
which
wound
up
with
the
reunion
of
the
second
avice
and
her
husband
and
the
hoary
peninsula
called
an
island
looked
just
the
same
as
before
though
many
who
had
formerly
projected
their
daily
shadows
upon
its
unrelieved
summer
whiteness
ceased
now
to
disturb
the
colourless
sunlight
there
the
general
change
nevertheless
was
small
the
silent
ships
came
and
went
from
the
wharf
the
chisels
clinked
in
the
quarries
file
after
file
of
whitey
-
brown
horses
in
strings
of
eight
or
ten
painfully
dragged
down
the
hill
the
square
blocks
of
stone
on
the
antediluvian
wooden
wheels
just
as
usual
the
lightship
winked
every
night
from
the
quicksands
to
the
beal
lantern
and
the
beal
lantern
glared
through
its
eye
-
glass
on
the
ship
the
canine
gnawing
audible
on
the
pebble
-
bank
had
been
repeated
ever
since
at
each
tide
but
the
pebbles
remained
undevoured
men
drank
smoked
and
spat
in
the
inns
with
only
a
little
more
adulteration
in
their
refreshments
and
a
trifle
less
dialect
in
their
speech
than
of
yore
but
one
figure
had
never
been
seen
on
the
channel
rock
in
the
interval
the
form
of
pierston
the
sculptor
whose
first
use
of
the
chisel
that
rock
had
instigated
he
had
lived
abroad
a
great
deal
and
in
fact
at
this
very
date
he
was
staying
at
an
hotel
in
rome
though
he
had
not
once
set
eyes
on
avice
since
parting
from
her
in
the
room
with
her
firstborn
he
had
managed
to
obtain
tidings
of
her
from
time
to
time
during
the
interval
in
this
way
pierston
learnt
that
shortly
after
their
resumption
of
a
common
life
in
her
house
ike
had
ill
-
used
her
till
fortunately
the
business
to
which
jocelyn
had
assisted
him
chancing
to
prosper
he
became
immersed
in
its
details
and
allowed
avice
to
pursue
her
household
courses
without
interference
initiating
that
kind
of
domestic
reconciliation
which
is
so
calm
and
durable
having
as
its
chief
ingredient
neither
hate
nor
love
but
an
all
-
embracing
indifference
at
first
pierston
had
sent
her
sums
of
money
privately
fearing
lest
her
husband
should
deny
her
material
comforts
but
he
soon
found
to
his
great
relief
that
such
help
was
unnecessary
social
ambition
prompting
ike
to
set
up
as
quite
a
gentleman
-
islander
and
to
allow
avice
a
scope
for
show
which
he
would
never
have
allowed
in
mere
kindness
being
in
rome
as
aforesaid
pierston
returned
one
evening
to
his
hotel
to
dine
after
spending
the
afternoon
among
the
busts
in
the
long
gallery
of
the
vatican
the
unconscious
habit
common
to
so
many
people
of
tracing
likes
in
unlikes
had
often
led
him
to
discern
or
to
fancy
he
discerned
in
the
roman
atmosphere
in
its
lights
and
shades
and
particularly
in
its
reflected
or
secondary
lights
something
resembling
the
atmosphere
of
his
native
promontory
perhaps
it
was
that
in
each
case
the
eye
was
mostly
resting
on
stone
that
the
quarries
of
ruins
in
the
eternal
city
reminded
him
of
the
quarries
of
maiden
rock
at
home
this
being
in
his
mind
when
he
sat
down
to
dinner
at
the
common
table
he
was
surprised
to
hear
an
american
gentleman
who
sat
opposite
mention
the
name
of
pierston
'
s
birthplace
the
american
was
talking
to
a
friend
about
a
lady
an
english
widow
whose
acquaintance
they
had
renewed
somewhere
in
the
channel
islands
during
a
recent
tour
after
having
known
her
as
a
young
woman
who
came
to
san
francisco
with
her
father
and
mother
many
years
before
her
father
was
then
a
rich
man
just
retired
from
the
business
of
a
stone
-
merchant
in
the
isle
of
slingers
but
he
had
engaged
in
large
speculations
and
had
lost
nearly
all
his
fortune
jocelyn
further
gathered
that
the
widowed
daughter
'
s
name
was
mrs
leverre
that
she
had
a
step
-
son
her
husband
having
been
a
jersey
gentleman
a
widower
and
that
the
step
-
son
seemed
to
be
a
promising
and
interesting
young
man
pierston
was
instantly
struck
with
the
perception
that
these
and
other
allusions
though
general
were
in
accord
with
the
history
of
his
long
-
lost
marcia
he
hardly
felt
any
desire
to
hunt
her
up
after
nearly
two
score
years
of
separation
but
he
was
impressed
enough
to
resolve
to
exchange
a
word
with
the
strangers
as
soon
as
he
could
get
opportunity
he
could
not
well
attract
their
attention
through
the
plants
upon
the
wide
table
and
even
if
he
had
been
able
he
was
disinclined
to
ask
questions
in
public
he
waited
on
till
dinner
was
over
and
when
the
strangers
withdrew
pierston
withdrew
in
their
rear
they
were
not
in
the
drawing
-
room
and
he
found
that
they
had
gone
out
there
was
no
chance
of
overtaking
them
but
pierston
waked
to
restlessness
by
their
remarks
wandered
up
and
down
the
adjoining
piazza
di
spagna
thinking
they
might
return
the
streets
below
were
immersed
in
shade
the
front
of
the
church
of
the
trinita
de
'
monti
at
the
top
was
flooded
with
orange
light
the
gloom
of
evening
gradually
intensifying
upon
the
broad
long
flight
of
steps
which
foot
-
passengers
incessantly
ascended
and
descended
with
the
insignificance
of
ants
the
dusk
wrapped
up
the
house
to
the
left
in
which
shelley
had
lived
and
that
to
the
right
in
which
keats
had
died
getting
back
to
the
hotel
he
learnt
that
the
americans
had
only
dropped
in
to
dine
and
were
staying
elsewhere
he
saw
no
more
of
them
and
on
reflection
he
was
not
deeply
concerned
for
what
earthly
woman
going
off
in
a
freak
as
marcia
had
done
and
keeping
silence
so
long
would
care
for
a
belated
friendship
with
him
now
in
the
sere
even
if
he
were
to
take
the
trouble
to
discover
her
thus
much
marcia
the
other
thread
of
his
connection
with
the
ancient
isle
of
slingers
was
stirred
by
a
letter
he
received
from
avice
a
little
after
this
date
in
which
she
stated
that
her
husband
ike
had
been
killed
in
his
own
quarry
by
an
accident
within
the
past
year
that
she
herself
had
been
ill
and
though
well
again
and
left
amply
provided
for
she
would
like
to
see
him
if
he
ever
came
that
way
as
she
had
not
communicated
for
several
long
years
her
expressed
wish
to
see
him
now
was
likely
to
be
prompted
by
something
more
something
newer
than
memories
of
him
yet
the
manner
of
her
writing
precluded
all
suspicion
that
she
was
thinking
of
him
as
an
old
lover
whose
suit
events
had
now
made
practicable
he
told
her
he
was
sorry
to
hear
that
she
had
been
ill
and
that
he
would
certainly
take
an
early
opportunity
of
going
down
to
her
home
on
his
next
visit
to
england
he
did
more
her
request
had
revived
thoughts
of
his
old
home
and
its
associations
and
instead
of
awaiting
other
reasons
for
a
return
he
made
her
the
operating
one
about
a
week
later
he
stood
once
again
at
the
foot
of
the
familiar
steep
whereon
the
houses
at
the
entrance
to
the
isle
were
perched
like
grey
pigeons
on
a
roof
-
side
at
top
-
o
'
-
hill
as
the
summit
of
the
rock
was
mostly
called
he
stood
looking
at
the
busy
doings
in
the
quarries
beyond
where
the
numerous
black
hoisting
-
cranes
scattered
over
the
central
plateau
had
the
appearance
of
a
swarm
of
crane
-
flies
resting
there
he
went
a
little
further
made
some
general
inquiries
about
the
accident
which
had
carried
off
avice
'
s
husband
in
the
previous
year
and
learnt
that
though
now
a
widow
she
had
plenty
of
friends
and
sympathizers
about
her
which
rendered
any
immediate
attention
to
her
on
his
part
unnecessary
considering
therefore
that
there
was
no
great
reason
why
he
should
call
on
her
so
soon
and
without
warning
he
turned
back
perhaps
after
all
her
request
had
been
dictated
by
a
momentary
feeling
only
and
a
considerable
strangeness
to
each
other
must
naturally
be
the
result
of
a
score
of
dividing
years
descending
to
the
bottom
he
took
his
seat
in
the
train
on
the
shore
which
soon
carried
him
along
the
bank
and
round
to
the
watering
-
place
five
miles
off
at
which
he
had
taken
up
his
quarters
for
a
few
days
here
as
he
stayed
on
his
local
interests
revived
whenever
he
went
out
he
could
see
the
island
that
was
once
his
home
lying
like
a
great
snail
upon
the
sea
across
the
bay
it
was
the
spring
of
the
year
local
steamers
had
begun
to
run
and
he
was
never
tired
of
standing
on
the
thinly
occupied
deck
of
one
of
these
as
it
skirted
the
island
and
revealed
to
him
on
the
cliffs
far
up
its
height
the
ruins
of
red
-
king
castle
behind
which
the
little
village
of
east
quarriers
lay
thus
matters
went
on
if
they
did
not
rather
stand
still
for
several
days
before
pierston
redeemed
his
vague
promise
to
seek
avice
out
and
in
the
meantime
he
was
surprised
by
the
arrival
of
another
letter
from
her
by
a
roundabout
route
she
had
heard
she
said
that
he
had
been
on
the
island
and
imagined
him
therefore
to
be
staying
somewhere
near
why
did
he
not
call
as
he
had
told
her
he
would
do
she
was
always
thinking
of
him
and
wishing
to
see
him
her
tone
was
anxious
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
she
really
had
something
to
say
which
she
did
not
want
to
write
he
wondered
what
it
could
be
and
started
the
same
afternoon
avice
who
had
been
little
in
his
mind
of
late
years
began
to
renew
for
herself
a
distinct
position
therein
he
was
fully
aware
that
since
his
earlier
manhood
a
change
had
come
over
his
regard
of
womankind
once
the
individual
had
been
nothing
more
to
him
than
the
temporary
abiding
-
place
of
the
typical
or
ideal
now
his
heart
showed
its
bent
to
be
a
growing
fidelity
to
the
specimen
with
all
her
pathetic
flaws
of
detail
which
flaws
so
far
from
sending
him
further
increased
his
tenderness
this
maturer
feeling
if
finer
and
higher
was
less
convenient
than
the
old
ardours
of
passion
could
be
felt
as
in
youth
without
the
recuperative
intervals
which
had
accompanied
evanescence
the
first
sensation
was
to
find
that
she
had
long
ceased
to
live
in
the
little
freehold
cottage
she
had
occupied
of
old
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
he
was
directed
along
the
road
to
the
west
of
the
modern
castle
past
the
entrance
on
that
side
and
onward
to
the
very
house
that
had
once
been
his
own
home
there
it
stood
as
of
yore
facing
up
the
channel
a
comfortable
roomy
structure
the
euonymus
and
other
shrubs
which
alone
would
stand
in
the
teeth
of
the
salt
wind
living
on
at
about
the
same
stature
in
front
of
it
but
the
paint
-
work
much
renewed
a
thriving
man
had
resided
there
of
late
evidently
the
widow
in
mourning
who
received
him
in
the
front
parlour
was
alas
but
the
sorry
shadow
of
avice
the
second
how
could
he
have
fancied
otherwise
after
twenty
years
yet
he
had
been
led
to
fancy
otherwise
almost
without
knowing
it
by
feeling
himself
unaltered
indeed
curiously
enough
nearly
the
first
words
she
said
to
him
were
why
you
are
just
the
same
'
just
the
same
yes
i
am
avice
he
answered
sadly
for
this
inability
to
ossify
with
the
rest
of
his
generation
threw
him
out
of
proportion
with
the
time
moreover
while
wearing
the
aspect
of
comedy
it
was
of
the
nature
of
tragedy
'
it
is
well
to
be
you
sir
she
went
on
i
have
had
troubles
to
take
the
bloom
off
me
'
yes
i
have
been
sorry
for
you
she
continued
to
regard
him
curiously
with
humorous
interest
and
he
knew
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
that
this
man
to
whom
she
had
formerly
looked
up
as
to
a
person
far
in
advance
of
her
along
the
lane
of
life
seemed
now
to
be
a
well
-
adjusted
contemporary
the
pair
of
them
observing
the
world
with
fairly
level
eyes
he
had
come
to
her
with
warmth
for
a
vision
which
on
reaching
her
he
found
to
have
departed
and
though
fairly
weaned
by
the
natural
reality
he
was
so
far
staunch
as
to
linger
hankeringly
they
talked
of
past
days
his
old
attachment
which
she
had
then
despised
being
now
far
more
absorbing
and
present
to
her
than
to
himself
she
unmistakably
won
upon
him
as
he
sat
on
a
curious
closeness
between
them
had
been
produced
in
his
imagination
by
the
discovery
that
she
was
passing
her
life
within
the
house
of
his
own
childhood
her
similar
surname
meant
little
here
but
it
was
also
his
and
added
to
the
identity
of
domicile
lent
a
strong
suggestiveness
to
the
accident
'
this
is
where
i
used
to
sit
when
my
parents
occupied
the
house
he
said
placing
himself
beside
that
corner
of
the
fireplace
which
commanded
a
view
through
the
window
i
could
see
a
bough
of
tamarisk
wave
outside
at
that
time
and
beyond
the
bough
the
same
abrupt
grassy
waste
towards
the
sea
and
at
night
the
same
old
lightship
blinking
far
out
there
place
yourself
on
the
spot
to
please
me
she
set
her
chair
where
he
indicated
and
pierston
stood
close
beside
her
directing
her
gaze
to
the
familiar
objects
he
had
regarded
thence
as
a
boy
her
head
and
face
the
latter
thoughtful
and
worn
enough
poor
thing
to
suggest
a
married
life
none
too
comfortable
were
close
to
his
breast
and
with
a
few
inches
further
incline
would
have
touched
it
'
and
now
you
are
the
inhabitant
i
the
visitor
he
said
i
am
glad
to
see
you
here
so
glad
avice
you
are
fairly
well
provided
for
i
think
i
may
assume
that
he
looked
round
the
room
at
the
solid
mahogany
furniture
and
at
the
modern
piano
and
show
bookcase
'
yes
ike
left
me
comfortable
twas
he
who
thought
of
moving
from
my
cottage
to
this
larger
house
he
bought
it
and
i
can
live
here
as
long
as
i
choose
to
apart
from
the
decline
of
his
adoration
to
friendship
there
seemed
to
be
a
general
convergence
of
positions
which
suggested
that
he
might
make
amends
for
the
desertion
of
avice
the
first
by
proposing
to
this
avice
when
a
meet
time
should
arrive
if
he
did
not
love
her
as
he
had
done
when
she
was
a
slim
thing
catching
mice
in
his
rooms
in
london
he
could
surely
be
content
at
his
age
with
comradeship
after
all
she
was
only
forty
to
his
sixty
the
feeling
that
he
really
could
be
thus
content
was
so
convincing
that
he
almost
believed
the
luxury
of
getting
old
and
reposeful
was
coming
to
his
restless
wandering
heart
at
last
'
well
you
have
come
at
last
sir
she
went
on
and
i
am
grateful
to
you
i
did
not
like
writing
and
yet
i
wanted
to
be
straightforward
have
you
guessed
at
all
why
i
wished
to
see
you
so
much
that
i
could
not
help
sending
twice
to
you
'
i
have
tried
but
cannot
'
try
again
it
is
a
pretty
reason
which
i
hope
you
will
forgive
'
i
am
sure
i
sha
'
n
'
t
unriddle
it
but
i
will
say
this
on
my
own
account
before
you
tell
me
i
have
always
taken
a
lingering
interest
in
you
which
you
must
value
for
what
it
is
worth
it
originated
so
far
as
it
concerns
you
personally
with
the
sight
of
you
in
that
cottage
round
the
corner
nineteen
or
twenty
years
ago
when
i
became
tenant
of
the
castle
opposite
but
that
was
not
the
very
beginning
the
very
beginning
was
a
score
of
years
before
that
when
i
a
young
fellow
of
one
-
and
-
twenty
coming
home
here
from
london
to
see
my
father
encountered
a
tender
woman
as
like
you
as
your
double
was
much
attracted
by
her
as
i
saw
her
day
after
day
flit
past
this
window
till
i
made
it
my
business
to
accompany
her
in
her
walks
awhile
i
as
you
know
was
not
a
staunch
fellow
and
it
all
ended
badly
but
at
any
rate
you
her
daughter
and
i
are
friends
'
ah
there
she
is
suddenly
exclaimed
avice
whose
attention
had
wandered
somewhat
from
his
retrospective
discourse
she
was
looking
from
the
window
towards
the
cliffs
where
upon
the
open
ground
quite
near
at
hand
a
slender
female
form
was
seen
rambling
along
she
is
out
for
a
walk
avice
continued
i
wonder
if
she
is
going
to
call
here
this
afternoon
she
is
living
at
the
castle
opposite
as
governess
'
o
she
is
'
yes
her
education
was
very
thorough
better
even
than
her
grandmother
'
s
i
was
the
neglected
one
and
her
father
and
myself
both
vowed
that
there
should
be
no
complaint
on
that
score
about
her
we
christened
her
avice
to
keep
up
the
name
as
you
requested
i
wish
you
could
speak
to
her
i
am
sure
you
would
like
her
'
is
that
the
baby
faltered
jocelyn
'
yes
the
baby
the
person
signified
now
much
nearer
was
a
still
more
modernized
up
-
to
-
date
edition
of
the
two
avices
of
that
blood
with
whom
he
had
been
involved
more
or
less
for
the
last
forty
years
a
ladylike
creature
was
she
almost
elegant
she
was
altogether
finer
in
figure
than
her
mother
or
grandmother
had
ever
been
which
made
her
more
of
a
woman
in
appearance
than
in
years
she
wore
a
large
-
disked
sun
-
hat
with
a
brim
like
a
wheel
whose
spokes
were
radiating
folds
of
muslin
lining
the
brim
a
black
margin
beyond
the
muslin
being
the
felloe
beneath
this
brim
her
hair
was
massed
low
upon
her
brow
the
colour
of
the
thick
tresses
being
probably
from
her
complexion
repeated
in
the
irises
of
her
large
deep
eyes
her
rather
nervous
lips
were
thin
and
closed
so
that
they
only
appeared
as
a
delicate
red
line
a
changeable
temperament
was
shown
by
that
mouth
quick
transitions
from
affection
to
aversion
from
a
pout
to
a
smile
it
was
avice
the
third
jocelyn
and
the
second
avice
continued
to
gaze
ardently
at
her
'
ah
she
is
not
coming
in
now
she
has
not
time
murmured
the
mother
with
some
disappointment
perhaps
she
means
to
run
across
in
the
evening
the
tall
girl
in
fact
went
past
and
on
till
she
was
out
of
sight
pierston
stood
as
in
a
dream
it
was
the
very
she
in
all
essential
particulars
and
with
an
intensification
of
general
charm
who
had
kissed
him
forty
years
before
when
he
turned
his
head
from
the
window
his
eyes
fell
again
upon
the
intermediate
avice
at
his
side
before
but
the
relic
of
the
well
-
beloved
she
had
now
become
its
empty
shrine
warm
friendship
indeed
he
felt
for
her
but
whatever
that
might
have
done
towards
the
instauration
of
a
former
dream
was
now
hopelessly
barred
by
the
rivalry
of
the
thing
itself
in
the
guise
of
a
lineal
successor
pierston
had
been
about
to
leave
but
he
sat
down
again
on
being
asked
if
he
would
stay
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
he
hardly
knew
for
a
moment
what
he
did
a
dim
thought
that
avice
the
renewed
avice
might
come
into
the
house
made
his
reseating
himself
an
act
of
spontaneity
he
forgot
that
twenty
years
earlier
he
had
called
the
now
mrs
pierston
an
elf
a
witch
and
that
lapse
of
time
had
probably
not
diminished
the
subtleties
implied
by
those
epithets
he
did
not
know
that
she
had
noted
every
impression
that
her
daughter
had
made
upon
him
how
he
contrived
to
attenuate
and
disperse
the
rather
tender
personalities
he
had
opened
up
with
the
new
avice
'
s
mother
pierston
never
exactly
defined
perhaps
she
saw
more
than
he
thought
she
saw
read
something
in
his
face
knew
that
about
his
nature
which
he
gave
her
no
credit
for
knowing
anyhow
the
conversation
took
the
form
of
a
friendly
gossip
from
that
minute
his
remarks
being
often
given
while
his
mind
was
turned
elsewhere
but
a
chill
passed
through
jocelyn
when
there
had
been
time
for
reflection
the
renewed
study
of
his
art
in
rome
without
any
counterbalancing
practical
pursuit
had
nourished
and
developed
his
natural
responsiveness
to
impressions
he
now
felt
that
his
old
trouble
his
doom
his
curse
indeed
he
had
sometimes
called
it
was
come
back
again
his
divinity
was
not
yet
propitiated
for
that
original
sin
against
her
image
in
the
person
of
avice
the
first
and
now
at
the
age
of
one
-
and
-
sixty
he
was
urged
on
and
on
like
the
jew
ahasuerus
or
in
the
phrase
of
the
islanders
themselves
like
a
blind
ram
the
goddess
an
abstraction
to
the
general
was
a
fairly
real
personage
to
pierston
he
had
watched
the
marble
images
of
her
which
stood
in
his
working
-
room
under
all
changes
of
light
and
shade
in
the
brightening
of
morning
in
the
blackening
of
eve
in
moonlight
in
lamplight
every
line
and
curve
of
her
body
none
naturally
knew
better
than
he
and
though
not
a
belief
it
was
as
has
been
stated
a
formula
a
superstition
that
the
three
avices
were
inter
-
penetrated
with
her
essence
'
and
the
next
avice
your
daughter
he
said
stumblingly
she
is
you
say
a
governess
at
the
castle
opposite
mrs
pierston
reaffirmed
the
fact
adding
that
the
girl
often
slept
at
home
because
she
her
mother
was
so
lonely
she
often
thought
she
would
like
to
keep
her
daughter
at
home
altogether
'
she
plays
that
instrument
i
suppose
said
pierston
regarding
the
piano
'
yes
she
plays
beautifully
she
had
the
best
instruction
that
masters
could
give
her
she
was
educated
at
sandbourne
'
which
room
does
she
call
hers
when
at
home
he
asked
curiously
'
the
little
one
over
this
it
had
been
his
own
strange
he
murmured
he
finished
tea
and
sat
after
tea
but
the
youthful
avice
did
not
arrive
with
the
avice
present
he
conversed
as
the
old
friend
no
more
at
last
it
grew
dusk
and
pierston
could
not
find
an
excuse
for
staying
longer
'
i
hope
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
your
daughter
he
said
in
leaving
knowing
that
he
might
have
added
with
predestinate
truth
of
my
new
tenderly
-
beloved
'
i
hope
you
will
she
answered
this
evening
she
evidently
has
gone
for
a
walk
instead
of
coming
here
'
and
by
-
the
-
bye
you
have
not
told
me
what
you
especially
wanted
to
see
me
for
'
ah
no
i
will
put
it
off
'
very
well
i
do
not
pretend
to
guess
'
i
must
tell
you
another
time
'
if
it
is
any
little
business
in
connection
with
your
late
husband
'
s
affairs
do
command
me
i
will
do
anything
i
can
'
thank
you
and
i
shall
see
you
again
soon
'
certainly
quite
soon
when
he
was
gone
she
looked
reflectively
at
the
spot
where
he
had
been
standing
and
said
best
hold
my
tongue
it
will
work
of
itself
without
my
telling
jocelyn
went
from
the
house
but
as
the
white
road
passed
under
his
feet
he
felt
in
no
mood
to
get
back
to
his
lodgings
in
the
town
on
the
mainland
he
lingered
about
upon
the
rugged
ground
for
a
long
while
thinking
of
the
extraordinary
reproduction
of
the
original
girl
in
this
new
form
he
had
seen
and
of
himself
as
of
a
foolish
dreamer
in
being
so
suddenly
fascinated
by
the
renewed
image
in
a
personality
not
one
-
third
of
his
age
as
a
physical
fact
no
doubt
the
preservation
of
the
likeness
was
no
uncommon
thing
here
but
it
helped
the
dream
passing
round
the
walls
of
the
new
castle
he
deviated
from
his
homeward
track
by
turning
down
the
familiar
little
lane
which
led
to
the
ruined
castle
of
the
red
king
it
took
him
past
the
cottage
in
which
the
new
avice
was
born
from
whose
precincts
he
had
heard
her
first
infantine
cry
pausing
he
saw
near
the
west
behind
him
the
new
moon
growing
distinct
upon
the
glow
he
was
subject
to
gigantic
fantasies
still
in
spite
of
himself
the
sight
of
the
new
moon
as
representing
one
who
by
her
so
-
called
inconstancy
acted
up
to
his
own
idea
of
a
migratory
well
-
beloved
made
him
feel
as
if
his
wraith
in
a
changed
sex
had
suddenly
looked
over
the
horizon
at
him
in
a
crowd
secretly
or
in
solitude
boldly
he
had
often
bowed
the
knee
three
times
to
this
sisterly
divinity
on
her
first
appearance
monthly
and
directed
a
kiss
towards
her
shining
shape
the
curse
of
his
qualities
(
if
it
were
not
a
blessing
)
was
far
from
having
spent
itself
yet
in
the
other
direction
the
castle
ruins
rose
square
and
dusky
against
the
sea
he
went
on
towards
these
around
which
he
had
played
as
a
boy
and
stood
by
the
walls
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
pondering
there
was
no
wind
and
but
little
tide
and
he
thought
he
could
hear
from
years
ago
a
voice
that
he
knew
it
certainly
was
a
voice
but
it
came
from
the
rocks
beneath
the
castle
ruin
'
mrs
atway
a
silence
followed
and
nobody
came
the
voice
spoke
again
john
stoney
neither
was
this
summons
attended
to
the
cry
continued
with
more
entreaty
william
scribben
the
voice
was
that
of
a
pierston
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
young
avice
'
s
surely
something
or
other
seemed
to
be
detaining
her
down
there
against
her
will
a
sloping
path
beneath
the
beetling
cliff
and
the
castle
walls
rising
sheer
from
its
summit
led
down
to
the
lower
level
whence
the
voice
proceeded
pierston
followed
the
pathway
and
soon
beheld
a
girl
in
light
clothing
the
same
he
had
seen
through
the
window
standing
upon
one
of
the
rocks
apparently
unable
to
move
pierston
hastened
across
to
her
'
o
thank
you
for
coming
she
murmured
with
some
timidity
i
have
met
with
an
awkward
mishap
i
live
near
here
and
am
not
frightened
really
my
foot
has
become
jammed
in
a
crevice
of
the
rock
and
i
cannot
get
it
out
try
how
i
will
what
shall
i
do
jocelyn
stooped
and
examined
the
cause
of
discomfiture
i
think
if
you
can
take
your
boot
off
he
said
your
foot
might
slip
out
leaving
the
boot
behind
she
tried
to
act
upon
this
advice
but
could
not
do
so
effectually
pierston
then
experimented
by
slipping
his
hand
into
the
crevice
till
he
could
just
reach
the
buttons
of
her
boot
which
however
he
could
not
unfasten
any
more
than
she
taking
his
penknife
from
his
pocket
he
tried
again
and
cut
off
the
buttons
one
by
one
the
boot
unfastened
and
out
slipped
the
foot
'
o
how
glad
i
am
she
cried
joyfully
i
was
fearing
i
should
have
to
stay
here
all
night
how
can
i
thank
you
enough
he
was
tugging
to
withdraw
the
boot
but
no
skill
that
he
could
exercise
would
move
it
without
tearing
at
last
she
said
do
not
try
any
longer
it
is
not
far
to
the
house
i
can
walk
in
my
stocking
'
i
will
assist
you
in
he
said
she
said
she
did
not
want
help
nevertheless
allowed
him
to
help
her
on
the
unshod
side
as
they
moved
on
she
explained
that
she
had
come
out
through
the
garden
door
had
been
standing
on
the
boulders
to
look
at
something
out
at
sea
just
discernible
in
the
evening
light
as
assisted
by
the
moon
and
in
jumping
down
had
wedged
her
foot
as
he
had
found
it
whatever
pierston
'
s
years
might
have
made
him
look
by
day
in
the
dusk
of
evening
he
was
fairly
presentable
as
a
pleasing
man
of
no
marked
antiquity
his
outline
differing
but
little
from
what
it
had
been
when
he
was
half
his
years
he
was
well
preserved
still
upright
trimly
shaven
agile
in
movement
wore
a
tightly
buttoned
suit
which
set
of
a
naturally
slight
figure
in
brief
he
might
have
been
of
any
age
as
he
appeared
to
her
at
this
moment
she
talked
to
him
with
the
co
-
equality
of
one
who
assumed
him
to
be
not
far
ahead
of
her
own
generation
and
as
the
growing
darkness
obscured
him
more
and
more
he
adopted
her
assumption
of
his
age
with
increasing
boldness
of
tone
the
flippant
harmless
freedom
of
the
watering
-
place
miss
which
avice
had
plainly
acquired
during
her
sojourn
at
the
sandbourne
school
helped
pierston
greatly
in
this
role
of
jeune
premier
which
he
was
not
unready
to
play
not
a
word
did
he
say
about
being
a
native
of
the
island
still
more
carefully
did
he
conceal
the
fact
of
his
having
courted
her
grandmother
and
engaged
himself
to
marry
that
attractive
lady
he
found
that
she
had
come
out
upon
the
rocks
through
the
same
little
private
door
from
the
lawn
of
the
modern
castle
which
had
frequently
afforded
him
egress
to
the
same
spot
in
years
long
past
pierston
accompanied
her
across
the
grounds
almost
to
the
entrance
of
the
mansion
the
place
being
now
far
better
kept
and
planted
than
when
he
had
rented
it
as
a
lonely
tenant
almost
indeed
restored
to
the
order
and
neatness
which
had
characterized
it
when
he
was
a
boy
like
her
granny
she
was
too
inexperienced
to
be
reserved
and
during
this
little
climb
leaning
upon
his
arm
there
was
time
for
a
great
deal
of
confidence
when
he
had
bidden
her
farewell
and
she
had
entered
leaving
him
in
the
dark
a
rush
of
sadness
through
pierston
'
s
soul
swept
down
all
the
temporary
pleasure
he
had
found
in
the
charming
girl
'
s
company
had
mephistopheles
sprung
from
the
ground
there
and
then
with
an
offer
to
jocelyn
of
restoration
to
youth
on
the
usual
terms
of
his
firm
the
sculptor
might
have
consented
to
sell
a
part
of
himself
which
he
felt
less
immediate
need
of
than
of
a
ruddy
lip
and
cheek
and
an
unploughed
brow
but
what
could
only
have
been
treated
as
a
folly
by
outsiders
was
almost
a
sorrow
for
him
why
was
he
born
with
such
a
temperament
and
this
concatenated
interest
could
hardly
have
arisen
even
with
pierston
but
for
a
conflux
of
circumstances
only
possible
here
the
three
avices
the
second
something
like
the
first
the
third
a
glorification
of
the
first
at
all
events
externally
were
the
outcome
of
the
immemorial
island
customs
of
intermarriage
and
of
prenuptial
union
under
which
conditions
the
type
of
feature
was
almost
uniform
from
parent
to
child
through
generations
so
that
till
quite
latterly
to
have
seen
one
native
man
and
woman
was
to
have
seen
the
whole
population
of
that
isolated
rock
so
nearly
cut
off
from
the
mainland
his
own
predisposition
and
the
sense
of
his
early
faithlessness
did
all
the
rest
he
turned
gloomily
away
and
let
himself
out
of
the
precincts
before
walking
along
the
couple
of
miles
of
road
which
would
conduct
him
to
the
little
station
on
the
shore
he
redescended
to
the
rocks
whereon
he
had
found
her
and
searched
about
for
the
fissure
which
had
made
a
prisoner
of
this
terribly
belated
edition
of
the
beloved
kneeling
down
beside
the
spot
he
inserted
his
hand
and
ultimately
by
much
wriggling
withdrew
the
pretty
boot
he
mused
over
it
for
a
moment
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
followed
the
stony
route
to
the
street
of
wells
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
pierston
in
calling
upon
the
new
avice
'
s
mother
as
often
as
he
should
choose
beyond
the
five
miles
of
intervening
railway
and
additional
mile
or
two
of
clambering
over
the
heights
of
the
island
two
days
later
therefore
he
repeated
his
journey
and
knocked
about
tea
-
time
at
the
widow
'
s
door
as
he
had
feared
the
daughter
was
not
at
home
he
sat
down
beside
the
old
sweetheart
who
having
eclipsed
her
mother
in
past
days
had
now
eclipsed
herself
in
her
child
jocelyn
produced
the
girl
'
s
boot
from
his
pocket
'
then
tis
you
who
helped
avice
out
of
her
predicament
said
mrs
pierston
with
surprise
'
yes
my
dear
friend
and
perhaps
i
shall
ask
you
to
help
me
out
of
mine
before
i
have
done
but
never
mind
that
now
what
did
she
tell
you
about
the
adventure
mrs
pierston
was
looking
thoughtfully
upon
him
well
tis
rather
strange
it
should
have
been
you
sir
she
replied
she
seemed
to
be
a
good
deal
interested
i
thought
it
might
have
been
a
younger
man
a
much
younger
man
'
it
might
have
been
as
far
as
feelings
were
concerned
now
avice
i
will
to
the
point
at
once
virtually
i
have
known
your
daughter
any
number
of
years
when
i
talk
to
her
i
can
anticipate
every
turn
of
her
thought
every
sentiment
every
act
so
long
did
i
study
those
things
in
your
mother
and
in
you
therefore
i
do
not
require
to
learn
her
she
was
learnt
by
me
in
her
previous
existences
now
do
not
be
shocked
i
am
willing
to
marry
her
i
should
be
overjoyed
to
do
it
if
there
would
be
nothing
preposterous
about
it
or
that
would
seem
like
a
man
making
himself
too
much
of
a
fool
and
so
degrading
her
in
consenting
i
can
make
her
comparatively
rich
as
you
know
and
i
would
indulge
her
every
whim
there
is
the
idea
bluntly
put
it
would
set
right
something
in
my
mind
that
has
been
wrong
for
forty
years
after
my
death
she
would
have
plenty
of
freedom
and
plenty
of
means
to
enjoy
it
mrs
isaac
pierston
seemed
only
a
little
surprised
certainly
not
shocked
'
well
if
i
did
not
think
you
might
be
a
bit
taken
with
her
she
said
with
an
arch
simplicity
which
could
hardly
be
called
unaffected
knowing
the
set
of
your
mind
from
my
little
time
with
you
years
ago
nothing
you
could
do
in
this
way
would
astonish
me
'
but
you
do
not
think
badly
of
me
for
it
'
not
at
all
by
-
the
-
bye
did
you
ever
guess
why
i
asked
you
to
come
but
never
mind
it
now
the
matter
is
past
of
course
it
would
depend
upon
what
avice
felt
perhaps
she
would
rather
marry
a
younger
man
'
and
suppose
a
satisfactory
younger
man
should
not
appear
mrs
pierston
showed
in
her
face
that
she
fully
recognized
the
difference
between
a
rich
bird
in
hand
and
a
young
bird
in
the
bush
she
looked
him
curiously
up
and
down
'
i
know
you
would
make
anybody
a
very
nice
husband
she
said
i
know
that
you
would
be
nicer
than
many
men
half
your
age
and
though
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
you
and
her
there
have
been
more
unequal
marriages
that
'
s
true
speaking
as
her
mother
i
can
say
that
i
should
not
object
to
you
sir
for
her
provided
she
liked
you
that
is
where
the
difficulty
will
lie
'
i
wish
you
would
help
me
to
get
over
that
difficulty
he
said
gently
remember
i
brought
back
a
truant
husband
to
you
twenty
years
ago
'
yes
you
did
she
assented
and
though
i
may
say
no
great
things
as
to
happiness
came
of
it
i
'
ve
always
seen
that
your
intentions
towards
me
were
none
the
less
noble
on
that
account
i
would
do
for
you
what
i
would
do
for
no
other
man
and
there
is
one
reason
in
particular
which
inclines
me
to
help
you
with
avice
that
i
should
feel
absolutely
certain
i
was
helping
her
to
a
kind
husband
'
well
that
would
remain
to
be
seen
i
would
at
any
rate
try
to
be
worthy
of
your
opinion
come
avice
for
old
times
'
sake
you
must
help
me
you
never
felt
anything
but
friendship
in
those
days
you
know
and
that
makes
it
easy
and
proper
for
you
to
do
me
a
good
turn
now
after
a
little
more
conversation
his
old
friend
promised
that
she
really
would
do
everything
that
lay
in
her
power
she
did
not
say
how
simple
she
thought
him
not
to
perceive
that
she
had
already
by
writing
to
him
been
doing
everything
that
lay
in
her
