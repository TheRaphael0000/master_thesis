'
an
outward
-
bound
mail
-
boat
had
come
in
that
afternoon
,
and
the
big
dining
-
room
of
the
hotel
was
more
than
half
full
of
people
with
a
-
hundred
-
pounds
-
round
-
the
-
world
tickets
in
their
pockets
.
there
were
married
couples
looking
domesticated
and
bored
with
each
other
in
the
midst
of
their
travels
;
there
were
small
parties
and
large
parties
,
and
lone
individuals
dining
solemnly
or
feasting
boisterously
,
but
all
thinking
,
conversing
,
joking
,
or
scowling
as
was
their
wont
at
home
;
and
just
as
intelligently
receptive
of
new
impressions
as
their
trunks
upstairs
.
henceforth
they
would
be
labelled
as
having
passed
through
this
and
that
place
,
and
so
would
be
their
luggage
.
they
would
cherish
this
distinction
of
their
persons
,
and
preserve
the
gummed
tickets
on
their
portmanteaus
as
documentary
evidence
,
as
the
only
permanent
trace
of
their
improving
enterprise
.
the
dark
-
faced
servants
tripped
without
noise
over
the
vast
and
polished
floor
;
now
and
then
a
girl
'
s
laugh
would
be
heard
,
as
innocent
and
empty
as
her
mind
,
or
,
in
a
sudden
hush
of
crockery
,
a
few
words
in
an
affected
drawl
from
some
wit
embroidering
for
the
benefit
of
a
grinning
tableful
the
last
funny
story
of
shipboard
scandal
.
two
nomadic
old
maids
,
dressed
up
to
kill
,
worked
acrimoniously
through
the
bill
of
fare
,
whispering
to
each
other
with
faded
lips
,
wooden
-
faced
and
bizarre
,
like
two
sumptuous
scarecrows
.
a
little
wine
opened
jim
'
s
heart
and
loosened
his
tongue
.
his
appetite
was
good
,
too
,
i
noticed
.
he
seemed
to
have
buried
somewhere
the
opening
episode
of
our
acquaintance
.
it
was
like
a
thing
of
which
there
would
be
no
more
question
in
this
world
.
and
all
the
time
i
had
before
me
these
blue
,
boyish
eyes
looking
straight
into
mine
,
this
young
face
,
these
capable
shoulders
,
the
open
bronzed
forehead
with
a
white
line
under
the
roots
of
clustering
fair
hair
,
this
appearance
appealing
at
sight
to
all
my
sympathies
:
this
frank
aspect
,
the
artless
smile
,
the
youthful
seriousness
.
he
was
of
the
right
sort
;
he
was
one
of
us
.
he
talked
soberly
,
with
a
sort
of
composed
unreserve
,
and
with
a
quiet
bearing
that
might
have
been
the
outcome
of
manly
self
-
control
,
of
impudence
,
of
callousness
,
of
a
colossal
unconsciousness
,
of
a
gigantic
deception
.
who
can
tell
!
from
our
tone
we
might
have
been
discussing
a
third
person
,
a
football
match
,
last
year
'
s
weather
.
my
mind
floated
in
a
sea
of
conjectures
till
the
turn
of
the
conversation
enabled
me
,
without
being
offensive
,
to
remark
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
this
inquiry
must
have
been
pretty
trying
to
him
.
he
darted
his
arm
across
the
tablecloth
,
and
clutching
my
hand
by
the
side
of
my
plate
,
glared
fixedly
.
i
was
startled
.
it
must
be
awfully
hard
,
"
i
stammered
,
confused
by
this
display
of
speechless
feeling
.
it
is
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
hell
,
"
he
burst
out
in
a
muffled
voice
.
'
this
movement
and
these
words
caused
two
well
-
groomed
male
globe
-
trotters
at
a
neighbouring
table
to
look
up
in
alarm
from
their
iced
pudding
.
i
rose
,
and
we
passed
into
the
front
gallery
for
coffee
and
cigars
.
'
on
little
octagon
tables
candles
burned
in
glass
globes
;
clumps
of
stiff
-
leaved
plants
separated
sets
of
cosy
wicker
chairs
;
and
between
the
pairs
of
columns
,
whose
reddish
shafts
caught
in
a
long
row
the
sheen
from
the
tall
windows
,
the
night
,
glittering
and
sombre
,
seemed
to
hang
like
a
splendid
drapery
.
the
riding
lights
of
ships
winked
afar
like
setting
stars
,
and
the
hills
across
the
roadstead
resembled
rounded
black
masses
of
arrested
thunder
-
clouds
.
i
could
not
clear
out
,
"
jim
began
.
the
skipper
did
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
'
s
all
very
well
for
him
.
i
couldn
'
t
,
and
i
wouldn
'
t
.
they
all
got
out
of
it
in
one
way
or
another
,
but
it
would
not
do
for
me
.
"
'
i
listened
with
concentrated
attention
,
not
daring
to
stir
in
my
chair
;
i
wanted
to
know
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
,
i
can
only
guess
.
he
would
be
confident
and
depressed
all
in
the
same
breath
,
as
if
some
conviction
of
innate
blamelessness
had
checked
the
truth
writhing
within
him
at
every
turn
.
he
began
by
saying
,
in
the
tone
in
which
a
man
would
admit
his
inability
to
jump
a
twenty
-
foot
wall
,
that
he
could
never
go
home
now
;
and
this
declaration
recalled
to
my
mind
what
brierly
had
said
,
"
that
the
old
parson
in
essex
seemed
to
fancy
his
sailor
son
not
a
little
.
"
'
i
ca
not
tell
you
whether
jim
knew
he
was
especially
"
fancied
,
"
but
the
tone
of
his
references
to
"
my
dad
"
was
calculated
to
give
me
a
notion
that
the
good
old
rural
dean
was
about
the
finest
man
that
ever
had
been
worried
by
the
cares
of
a
large
family
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
.
this
,
though
never
stated
,
was
implied
with
an
anxiety
that
there
should
be
no
mistake
about
it
,
which
was
really
very
true
and
charming
,
but
added
a
poignant
sense
of
lives
far
off
to
the
other
elements
of
the
story
.
he
has
seen
it
all
in
the
home
papers
by
this
time
,
"
said
jim
.
i
can
never
face
the
poor
old
chap
.
"
i
did
not
dare
to
lift
my
eyes
at
this
till
i
heard
him
add
,
"
i
could
never
explain
.
he
would
not
understand
.
"
then
i
looked
up
.
he
was
smoking
reflectively
,
and
after
a
moment
,
rousing
himself
,
began
to
talk
again
.
he
discovered
at
once
a
desire
that
i
should
not
confound
him
with
his
partners
in
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
crime
,
let
us
call
it
.
he
was
not
one
of
them
;
he
was
altogether
of
another
sort
.
i
gave
no
sign
of
dissent
.
i
had
no
intention
,
for
the
sake
of
barren
truth
,
to
rob
him
of
the
smallest
particle
of
any
saving
grace
that
would
come
in
his
way
.
i
did
not
know
how
much
of
it
he
believed
himself
.
i
did
not
know
what
he
was
playing
up
to
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
if
he
was
playing
up
to
anything
at
all
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
i
suspect
he
did
not
know
either
;
for
it
is
my
belief
no
man
ever
understands
quite
his
own
artful
dodges
to
escape
from
the
grim
shadow
of
self
-
knowledge
.
i
made
no
sound
all
the
time
he
was
wondering
what
he
had
better
do
after
"
that
stupid
inquiry
was
over
.
"
'
apparently
he
shared
brierly
'
s
contemptuous
opinion
of
these
proceedings
ordained
by
law
.
he
would
not
know
where
to
turn
,
he
confessed
,
clearly
thinking
aloud
rather
than
talking
to
me
.
certificate
gone
,
career
broken
,
no
money
to
get
away
,
no
work
that
he
could
obtain
as
far
as
he
could
see
.
at
home
he
could
perhaps
get
something
;
but
it
meant
going
to
his
people
for
help
,
and
that
he
would
not
do
.
he
saw
nothing
for
it
but
ship
before
the
mast
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
could
get
perhaps
a
quartermaster
'
s
billet
in
some
steamer
.
would
do
for
a
quartermaster
.
do
you
think
you
would
?
"
i
asked
pitilessly
.
he
jumped
up
,
and
going
to
the
stone
balustrade
looked
out
into
the
night
.
in
a
moment
he
was
back
,
towering
above
my
chair
with
his
youthful
face
clouded
yet
by
the
pain
of
a
conquered
emotion
.
he
had
understood
very
well
i
did
not
doubt
his
ability
to
steer
a
ship
.
in
a
voice
that
quavered
a
bit
he
asked
me
why
did
i
say
that
?
i
had
been
"
no
end
kind
"
to
him
.
i
had
not
even
laughed
at
him
when
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
here
he
began
to
mumble
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
mistake
,
you
know
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
made
a
confounded
ass
of
myself
.
"
i
broke
in
by
saying
rather
warmly
that
for
me
such
a
mistake
was
not
a
matter
to
laugh
at
.
he
sat
down
and
drank
deliberately
some
coffee
,
emptying
the
small
cup
to
the
last
drop
.
that
does
not
mean
i
admit
for
a
moment
the
cap
fitted
,
"
he
declared
distinctly
.
no
?
"
i
said
.
no
,
"
he
affirmed
with
quiet
decision
.
do
you
know
what
you
would
have
done
?
do
you
?
and
you
do
not
think
yourself
"
he
gulped
something
you
do
not
think
yourself
a
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
cur
?
"
'
and
with
this
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
upon
my
honour
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
looked
up
at
me
inquisitively
.
it
was
a
question
it
appears
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
bona
fide
question
!
however
,
he
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
.
before
i
could
recover
he
went
on
,
with
his
eyes
straight
before
him
,
as
if
reading
off
something
written
on
the
body
of
the
night
.
it
is
all
in
being
ready
.
i
wasn
'
t
;
not
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
not
then
.
i
do
not
want
to
excuse
myself
;
but
i
would
like
to
explain
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
would
like
somebody
to
understand
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
somebody
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
one
person
at
least
!
you
!
why
not
you
?
"
'
it
was
solemn
,
and
a
little
ridiculous
too
,
as
they
always
are
,
those
struggles
of
an
individual
trying
to
save
from
the
fire
his
idea
of
what
his
moral
identity
should
be
,
this
precious
notion
of
a
convention
,
only
one
of
the
rules
of
the
game
,
nothing
more
,
but
all
the
same
so
terribly
effective
by
its
assumption
of
unlimited
power
over
natural
instincts
,
by
the
awful
penalties
of
its
failure
.
he
began
his
story
quietly
enough
.
on
board
that
dale
line
steamer
that
had
picked
up
these
four
floating
in
a
boat
upon
the
discreet
sunset
glow
of
the
sea
,
they
had
been
after
the
first
day
looked
askance
upon
.
the
fat
skipper
told
some
story
,
the
others
had
been
silent
,
and
at
first
it
had
been
accepted
.
you
do
not
cross
-
examine
poor
castaways
you
had
the
good
luck
to
save
,
if
not
from
cruel
death
,
then
at
least
from
cruel
suffering
.
afterwards
,
with
time
to
think
it
over
,
it
might
have
struck
the
officers
of
the
avondale
that
there
was
"
something
fishy
"
in
the
affair
;
but
of
course
they
would
keep
their
doubts
to
themselves
.
they
had
picked
up
the
captain
,
the
mate
,
and
two
engineers
of
the
steamer
patna
sunk
at
sea
,
and
that
,
very
properly
,
was
enough
for
them
.
i
did
not
ask
jim
about
the
nature
of
his
feelings
during
the
ten
days
he
spent
on
board
.
from
the
way
he
narrated
that
part
i
was
at
liberty
to
infer
he
was
partly
stunned
by
the
discovery
he
had
made
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
discovery
about
himself
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
no
doubt
was
at
work
trying
to
explain
it
away
to
the
only
man
who
was
capable
of
appreciating
all
its
tremendous
magnitude
.
you
must
understand
he
did
not
try
to
minimise
its
importance
.
of
that
i
am
sure
;
and
therein
lies
his
distinction
.
as
to
what
sensations
he
experienced
when
he
got
ashore
and
heard
the
unforeseen
conclusion
of
the
tale
in
which
he
had
taken
such
a
pitiful
part
,
he
told
me
nothing
of
them
,
and
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
.
'
i
wonder
whether
he
felt
the
ground
cut
from
under
his
feet
?
i
wonder
?
but
no
doubt
he
managed
to
get
a
fresh
foothold
very
soon
.
he
was
ashore
a
whole
fortnight
waiting
in
the
sailors
'
home
,
and
as
there
were
six
or
seven
men
staying
there
at
the
time
,
i
had
heard
of
him
a
little
.
their
languid
opinion
seemed
to
be
that
,
in
addition
to
his
other
shortcomings
,
he
was
a
sulky
brute
.
he
had
passed
these
days
on
the
verandah
,
buried
in
a
long
chair
,
and
coming
out
of
his
place
of
sepulture
only
at
meal
-
times
or
late
at
night
,
when
he
wandered
on
the
quays
all
by
himself
,
detached
from
his
surroundings
,
irresolute
and
silent
,
like
a
ghost
without
a
home
to
haunt
.
i
do
not
think
i
'
ve
spoken
three
words
to
a
living
soul
in
all
that
time
,
"
he
said
,
making
me
very
sorry
for
him
;
and
directly
he
added
,
"
one
of
these
fellows
would
have
been
sure
to
blurt
out
something
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
put
up
with
,
and
i
did
not
want
a
row
.
no
!
not
then
.
i
was
too
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
too
i
had
no
heart
for
it
.
"
"
so
that
bulkhead
held
out
after
all
,
"
i
remarked
cheerfully
.
yes
,
"
he
murmured
,
"
it
held
.
and
yet
i
swear
to
you
i
felt
it
bulge
under
my
hand
.
"
"
it
is
extraordinary
what
strains
old
iron
will
stand
sometimes
,
"
i
said
.
thrown
back
in
his
seat
,
his
legs
stiffly
out
and
arms
hanging
down
,
he
nodded
slightly
several
times
.
you
could
not
conceive
a
sadder
spectacle
.
suddenly
he
lifted
his
head
;
he
sat
up
;
he
slapped
his
thigh
.
ah
!
what
a
chance
missed
!
my
god
!
what
a
chance
missed
!
"
he
blazed
out
,
but
the
ring
of
the
last
"
missed
"
resembled
a
cry
wrung
out
by
pain
.
'
he
was
silent
again
with
a
still
,
far
-
away
look
of
fierce
yearning
after
that
missed
distinction
,
with
his
nostrils
for
an
instant
dilated
,
sniffing
the
intoxicating
breath
of
that
wasted
opportunity
.
if
you
think
i
was
either
surprised
or
shocked
you
do
me
an
injustice
in
more
ways
than
one
!
ah
,
he
was
an
imaginative
beggar
!
he
would
give
himself
away
;
he
would
give
himself
up
.
i
could
see
in
his
glance
darted
into
the
night
all
his
inner
being
carried
on
,
projected
headlong
into
the
fanciful
realm
of
recklessly
heroic
aspirations
.
he
had
no
leisure
to
regret
what
he
had
lost
,
he
was
so
wholly
and
naturally
concerned
for
what
he
had
failed
to
obtain
.
he
was
very
far
away
from
me
who
watched
him
across
three
feet
of
space
.
with
every
instant
he
was
penetrating
deeper
into
the
impossible
world
of
romantic
achievements
.
he
got
to
the
heart
of
it
at
last
!
a
strange
look
of
beatitude
overspread
his
features
,
his
eyes
sparkled
in
the
light
of
the
candle
burning
between
us
;
he
positively
smiled
!
he
had
penetrated
to
the
very
heart
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
the
very
heart
.
it
was
an
ecstatic
smile
that
your
faces
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
or
mine
either
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
will
never
wear
,
my
dear
boys
.
i
whisked
him
back
by
saying
,
"
if
you
had
stuck
to
the
ship
,
you
mean
!
"
'
he
turned
upon
me
,
his
eyes
suddenly
amazed
and
full
of
pain
,
with
a
bewildered
,
startled
,
suffering
face
,
as
though
he
had
tumbled
down
from
a
star
.
neither
you
nor
i
will
ever
look
like
this
on
any
man
.
he
shuddered
profoundly
,
as
if
a
cold
finger
-
tip
had
touched
his
heart
.
last
of
all
he
sighed
.
'
i
was
not
in
a
merciful
mood
.
he
provoked
one
by
his
contradictory
indiscretions
.
it
is
unfortunate
you
did
not
know
beforehand
!
"
i
said
with
every
unkind
intention
;
but
the
perfidious
shaft
fell
harmless
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
dropped
at
his
feet
like
a
spent
arrow
,
as
it
were
,
and
he
did
not
think
of
picking
it
up
.
perhaps
he
had
not
even
seen
it
.
presently
,
lolling
at
ease
,
he
said
,
"
dash
it
all
!
i
tell
you
it
bulged
.
i
was
holding
up
my
lamp
along
the
angle
-
iron
in
the
lower
deck
when
a
flake
of
rust
as
big
as
the
palm
of
my
hand
fell
off
the
plate
,
all
of
itself
.
"
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
.
the
thing
stirred
and
jumped
off
like
something
alive
while
i
was
looking
at
it
.
"
"
that
made
you
feel
pretty
bad
,
"
i
observed
casually
.
do
you
suppose
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
i
was
thinking
of
myself
,
with
a
hundred
and
sixty
people
at
my
back
,
all
fast
asleep
in
that
fore
-
'
tween
-
deck
alone
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
more
of
them
aft
;
more
on
the
deck
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
sleeping
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
knowing
nothing
about
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
three
times
as
many
as
there
were
boats
for
,
even
if
there
had
been
time
?
i
expected
to
see
the
iron
open
out
as
i
stood
there
and
the
rush
of
water
going
over
them
as
they
lay
.
what
could
i
do
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
what
?
"
'
i
can
easily
picture
him
to
myself
in
the
peopled
gloom
of
the
cavernous
place
,
with
the
light
of
the
globe
-
lamp
falling
on
a
small
portion
of
the
bulkhead
that
had
the
weight
of
the
ocean
on
the
other
side
,
and
the
breathing
of
unconscious
sleepers
in
his
ears
.
i
can
see
him
glaring
at
the
iron
,
startled
by
the
falling
rust
,
overburdened
by
the
knowledge
of
an
imminent
death
.
this
,
i
gathered
,
was
the
second
time
he
had
been
sent
forward
by
that
skipper
of
his
,
who
,
i
rather
think
,
wanted
to
keep
him
away
from
the
bridge
.
he
told
me
that
his
first
impulse
was
to
shout
and
straightway
make
all
those
people
leap
out
of
sleep
into
terror
;
but
such
an
overwhelming
sense
of
his
helplessness
came
over
him
that
he
was
not
able
to
produce
a
sound
.
this
is
,
i
suppose
,
what
people
mean
by
the
tongue
cleaving
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
.
too
dry
,
"
was
the
concise
expression
he
used
in
reference
to
this
state
.
without
a
sound
,
then
,
he
scrambled
out
on
deck
through
the
number
one
hatch
.
a
windsail
rigged
down
there
swung
against
him
accidentally
,
and
he
remembered
that
the
light
touch
of
the
canvas
on
his
face
nearly
knocked
him
off
the
hatchway
ladder
.
'
he
confessed
that
his
knees
wobbled
a
good
deal
as
he
stood
on
the
foredeck
looking
at
another
sleeping
crowd
.
the
engines
having
been
stopped
by
that
time
,
the
steam
was
blowing
off
.
its
deep
rumble
made
the
whole
night
vibrate
like
a
bass
string
.
the
ship
trembled
to
it
.
'
he
saw
here
and
there
a
head
lifted
off
a
mat
,
a
vague
form
uprise
in
sitting
posture
,
listen
sleepily
for
a
moment
,
sink
down
again
into
the
billowy
confusion
of
boxes
,
steam
-
winches
,
ventilators
.
he
was
aware
all
these
people
did
not
know
enough
to
take
intelligent
notice
of
that
strange
noise
.
the
ship
of
iron
,
the
men
with
white
faces
,
all
the
sights
,
all
the
sounds
,
everything
on
board
to
that
ignorant
and
pious
multitude
was
strange
alike
,
and
as
trustworthy
as
it
would
for
ever
remain
incomprehensible
.
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
fact
was
fortunate
.
the
idea
of
it
was
simply
terrible
.
'
you
must
remember
he
believed
,
as
any
other
man
would
have
done
in
his
place
,
that
the
ship
would
go
down
at
any
moment
;
the
bulging
,
rust
-
eaten
plates
that
kept
back
the
ocean
,
fatally
must
give
way
,
all
at
once
like
an
undermined
dam
,
and
let
in
a
sudden
and
overwhelming
flood
.
he
stood
still
looking
at
these
recumbent
bodies
,
a
doomed
man
aware
of
his
fate
,
surveying
the
silent
company
of
the
dead
.
they
were
dead
!
nothing
could
save
them
!
there
were
boats
enough
for
half
of
them
perhaps
,
but
there
was
no
time
.
no
time
!
no
time
!
it
did
not
seem
worth
while
to
open
his
lips
,
to
stir
hand
or
foot
.
before
he
could
shout
three
words
,
or
make
three
steps
,
he
would
be
floundering
in
a
sea
whitened
awfully
by
the
desperate
struggles
of
human
beings
,
clamorous
with
the
distress
of
cries
for
help
.
there
was
no
help
.
he
imagined
what
would
happen
perfectly
;
he
went
through
it
all
motionless
by
the
hatchway
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
went
through
it
to
the
very
last
harrowing
detail
.
i
think
he
went
through
it
again
while
he
was
telling
me
these
things
he
could
not
tell
the
court
.
i
saw
as
clearly
as
i
see
you
now
that
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
.
it
seemed
to
take
all
life
out
of
my
limbs
.
i
thought
i
might
just
as
well
stand
where
i
was
and
wait
.
i
did
not
think
i
had
many
seconds
"
suddenly
the
steam
ceased
blowing
off
.
the
noise
,
he
remarked
,
had
been
distracting
,
but
the
silence
at
once
became
intolerably
oppressive
.
i
thought
i
would
choke
before
i
got
drowned
,
"
he
said
.
'
he
protested
he
did
not
think
of
saving
himself
.
the
only
distinct
thought
formed
,
vanishing
,
and
re
-
forming
in
his
brain
,
was
:
eight
hundred
people
and
seven
boats
;
eight
hundred
people
and
seven
boats
.
somebody
was
speaking
aloud
inside
my
head
,
"
he
said
a
little
wildly
.
eight
hundred
people
and
seven
boats
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
no
time
!
just
think
of
it
.
"
he
leaned
towards
me
across
the
little
table
,
and
i
tried
to
avoid
his
stare
.
do
you
think
i
was
afraid
of
death
?
"
he
asked
in
a
voice
very
fierce
and
low
.
he
brought
down
his
open
hand
with
a
bang
that
made
the
coffee
-
cups
dance
.
i
am
ready
to
swear
i
was
not
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
was
not
.
by
god
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
no
!
"
he
hitched
himself
upright
and
crossed
his
arms
;
his
chin
fell
on
his
breast
.
'
the
soft
clashes
of
crockery
reached
us
faintly
through
the
high
windows
.
there
was
a
burst
of
voices
,
and
several
men
came
out
in
high
good
-
humour
into
the
gallery
.
they
were
exchanging
jocular
reminiscences
of
the
donkeys
in
cairo
.
a
pale
anxious
youth
stepping
softly
on
long
legs
was
being
chaffed
by
a
strutting
and
rubicund
globe
-
trotter
about
his
purchases
in
the
bazaar
.
no
,
really
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
do
you
think
i
'
ve
been
done
to
that
extent
?
"
he
inquired
very
earnest
and
deliberate
.
the
band
moved
away
,
dropping
into
chairs
as
they
went
;
matches
flared
,
illuminating
for
a
second
faces
without
the
ghost
of
an
expression
and
the
flat
glaze
of
white
shirt
-
fronts
;
the
hum
of
many
conversations
animated
with
the
ardour
of
feasting
sounded
to
me
absurd
and
infinitely
remote
.
some
of
the
crew
were
sleeping
on
the
number
one
hatch
within
reach
of
my
arm
,
"
began
jim
again
.
'
you
must
know
they
kept
kalashee
watch
in
that
ship
,
all
hands
sleeping
through
the
night
,
and
only
the
reliefs
of
quartermasters
and
look
-
out
men
being
called
.
he
was
tempted
to
grip
and
shake
the
shoulder
of
the
nearest
lascar
,
but
he
didn
'
t
.
something
held
his
arms
down
along
his
sides
.
he
was
not
afraid
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
oh
no
!
only
he
just
couldn
'
t
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
'
s
all
.
he
was
not
afraid
of
death
perhaps
,
but
i
will
tell
you
what
,
he
was
afraid
of
the
emergency
.
his
confounded
imagination
had
evoked
for
him
all
the
horrors
of
panic
,
the
trampling
rush
,
the
pitiful
screams
,
boats
swamped
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
all
the
appalling
incidents
of
a
disaster
at
sea
he
had
ever
heard
of
.
he
might
have
been
resigned
to
die
but
i
suspect
he
wanted
to
die
without
added
terrors
,
quietly
,
in
a
sort
of
peaceful
trance
.
a
certain
readiness
to
perish
is
not
so
very
rare
,
but
it
is
seldom
that
you
meet
men
whose
souls
,
steeled
in
the
impenetrable
armour
of
resolution
,
are
ready
to
fight
a
losing
battle
to
the
last
;
the
desire
of
peace
waxes
stronger
as
hope
declines
,
till
at
last
it
conquers
the
very
desire
of
life
.
which
of
us
here
has
not
observed
this
,
or
maybe
experienced
something
of
that
feeling
in
his
own
person
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
this
extreme
weariness
of
emotions
,
the
vanity
of
effort
,
the
yearning
for
rest
?
those
striving
with
unreasonable
forces
know
it
well
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
shipwrecked
castaways
in
boats
,
wanderers
lost
in
a
desert
,
men
battling
against
the
unthinking
might
of
nature
,
or
the
stupid
brutality
of
crowds
.
'
'
how
long
he
stood
stock
-
still
by
the
hatch
expecting
every
moment
to
feel
the
ship
dip
under
his
feet
and
the
rush
of
water
take
him
at
the
back
and
toss
him
like
a
chip
,
i
cannot
say
.
not
very
long
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
two
minutes
perhaps
.
a
couple
of
men
he
could
not
make
out
began
to
converse
drowsily
,
and
also
,
he
could
not
tell
where
,
he
detected
a
curious
noise
of
shuffling
feet
.
above
these
faint
sounds
there
was
that
awful
stillness
preceding
a
catastrophe
,
that
trying
silence
of
the
moment
before
the
crash
;
then
it
came
into
his
head
that
perhaps
he
would
have
time
to
rush
along
and
cut
all
the
lanyards
of
the
gripes
,
so
that
the
boats
would
float
as
the
ship
went
down
.
'
the
patna
had
a
long
bridge
,
and
all
the
boats
were
up
there
,
four
on
one
side
and
three
on
the
other
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
smallest
of
them
on
the
port
-
side
and
nearly
abreast
of
the
steering
gear
.
he
assured
me
,
with
evident
anxiety
to
be
believed
,
that
he
had
been
most
careful
to
keep
them
ready
for
instant
service
.
he
knew
his
duty
.
i
dare
say
he
was
a
good
enough
mate
as
far
as
that
went
.
i
always
believed
in
being
prepared
for
the
worst
,
"
he
commented
,
staring
anxiously
in
my
face
.
i
nodded
my
approval
of
the
sound
principle
,
averting
my
eyes
before
the
subtle
unsoundness
of
the
man
.
'
he
started
unsteadily
to
run
.
he
had
to
step
over
legs
,
avoid
stumbling
against
the
heads
.
suddenly
some
one
caught
hold
of
his
coat
from
below
,
and
a
distressed
voice
spoke
under
his
elbow
.
the
light
of
the
lamp
he
carried
in
his
right
hand
fell
upon
an
upturned
dark
face
whose
eyes
entreated
him
together
with
the
voice
.
he
had
picked
up
enough
of
the
language
to
understand
the
word
water
,
repeated
several
times
in
a
tone
of
insistence
,
of
prayer
,
almost
of
despair
.
he
gave
a
jerk
to
get
away
,
and
felt
an
arm
embrace
his
leg
.
the
beggar
clung
to
me
like
a
drowning
man
,
"
he
said
impressively
.
water
,
water
!
what
water
did
he
mean
?
what
did
he
know
?
as
calmly
as
i
could
i
ordered
him
to
let
go
.
he
was
stopping
me
,
time
was
pressing
,
other
men
began
to
stir
;
i
wanted
time
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
time
to
cut
the
boats
adrift
.
he
got
hold
of
my
hand
now
,
and
i
felt
that
he
would
begin
to
shout
.
it
flashed
upon
me
it
was
enough
to
start
a
panic
,
and
i
hauled
off
with
my
free
arm
and
slung
the
lamp
in
his
face
.
the
glass
jingled
,
the
light
went
out
,
but
the
blow
made
him
let
go
,
and
i
ran
off
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
wanted
to
get
at
the
boats
;
i
wanted
to
get
at
the
boats
.
he
leaped
after
me
from
behind
.
i
turned
on
him
.
he
would
not
keep
quiet
;
he
tried
to
shout
;
i
had
half
throttled
him
before
i
made
out
what
he
wanted
.
he
wanted
some
water
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
water
to
drink
;
they
were
on
strict
allowance
,
you
know
,
and
he
had
with
him
a
young
boy
i
had
noticed
several
times
.
his
child
was
sick
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
thirsty
.
he
had
caught
sight
of
me
as
i
passed
by
,
and
was
begging
for
a
little
water
.
that
'
s
all
.
we
were
under
the
bridge
,
in
the
dark
.
he
kept
on
snatching
at
my
wrists
;
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
him
.
i
dashed
into
my
berth
,
grabbed
my
water
-
bottle
,
and
thrust
it
into
his
hands
.
he
vanished
.
i
did
not
find
out
till
then
how
much
i
was
in
want
of
a
drink
myself
.
"
he
leaned
on
one
elbow
with
a
hand
over
his
eyes
.
i
felt
a
creepy
sensation
all
down
my
backbone
;
there
was
something
peculiar
in
all
this
.
the
fingers
of
the
hand
that
shaded
his
brow
trembled
slightly
.
he
broke
the
short
silence
.
"
these
things
happen
only
once
to
a
man
and
ah
!
well
!
when
i
got
on
the
bridge
at
last
the
beggars
were
getting
one
of
the
boats
off
the
chocks
.
a
boat
!
i
was
running
up
the
ladder
when
a
heavy
blow
fell
on
my
shoulder
,
just
missing
my
head
.
it
did
not
stop
me
,
and
the
chief
engineer
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
they
had
got
him
out
of
his
bunk
by
then
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
raised
the
boat
-
stretcher
again
.
somehow
i
had
no
mind
to
be
surprised
at
anything
.
all
this
seemed
natural
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
awful
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
awful
.
i
dodged
that
miserable
maniac
,
lifted
him
off
the
deck
as
though
he
had
been
a
little
child
,
and
he
started
whispering
in
my
arms
:
'
don
'
t
!
don
'
t
!
i
thought
you
were
one
of
them
niggers
.
'
i
flung
him
away
,
he
skidded
along
the
bridge
and
knocked
the
legs
from
under
the
little
chap
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
second
.
the
skipper
,
busy
about
the
boat
,
looked
round
and
came
at
me
head
down
,
growling
like
a
wild
beast
.
i
flinched
no
more
than
a
stone
.
i
was
as
solid
standing
there
as
this
,
"
he
tapped
lightly
with
his
knuckles
the
wall
beside
his
chair
.
it
was
as
though
i
had
heard
it
all
,
seen
it
all
,
gone
through
it
all
twenty
times
already
.
i
was
not
afraid
of
them
.
i
drew
back
my
fist
and
he
stopped
short
,
muttering
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
ah
!
it
is
you
.
lend
a
hand
quick
.
'
"
that
'
s
what
he
said
.
quick
!
as
if
anybody
could
be
quick
enough
.
'
are
not
you
going
to
do
something
?
'
i
asked
.
'
yes
.
clear
out
,
'
he
snarled
over
his
shoulder
.
"
i
do
not
think
i
understood
then
what
he
meant
.
the
other
two
had
picked
themselves
up
by
that
time
,
and
they
rushed
together
to
the
boat
.
they
tramped
,
they
wheezed
,
they
shoved
,
they
cursed
the
boat
,
the
ship
,
each
other
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
cursed
me
.
all
in
mutters
.
i
did
not
move
,
i
did
not
speak
.
i
watched
the
slant
of
the
ship
.
she
was
as
still
as
if
landed
on
the
blocks
in
a
dry
dock
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
only
she
was
like
this
,
"
he
held
up
his
hand
,
palm
under
,
the
tips
of
the
fingers
inclined
downwards
.
like
this
,
"
he
repeated
.
i
could
see
the
line
of
the
horizon
before
me
,
as
clear
as
a
bell
,
above
her
stem
-
head
;
i
could
see
the
water
far
off
there
black
and
sparkling
,
and
still
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
still
as
a
-
pond
,
deadly
still
,
more
still
than
ever
sea
was
before
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
more
still
than
i
could
bear
to
look
at
.
have
you
watched
a
ship
floating
head
down
,
checked
in
sinking
by
a
sheet
of
old
iron
too
rotten
to
stand
being
shored
up
?
have
you
?
oh
yes
,
shored
up
?
i
thought
of
that
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
thought
of
every
mortal
thing
;
but
can
you
shore
up
a
bulkhead
in
five
minutes
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
or
in
fifty
for
that
matter
?
where
was
i
going
to
get
men
that
would
go
down
below
?
and
the
timber
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
timber
!
would
you
have
had
the
courage
to
swing
the
maul
for
the
first
blow
if
you
had
seen
that
bulkhead
?
do
not
say
you
would
:
you
had
not
seen
it
;
nobody
would
.
hang
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
do
a
thing
like
that
you
must
believe
there
is
a
chance
,
one
in
a
thousand
,
at
least
,
some
ghost
of
a
chance
;
and
you
would
not
have
believed
.
nobody
would
have
believed
.
you
think
me
a
cur
for
standing
there
,
but
what
would
you
have
done
?
what
!
you
ca
not
tell
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
nobody
can
tell
.
one
must
have
time
to
turn
round
.
what
would
you
have
me
do
?
where
was
the
kindness
in
making
crazy
with
fright
all
those
people
i
could
not
save
single
-
handed
.
.
.
.

that
nothing
could
save

look
here
!
as
true
as
i
sit
on
this
chair
before
you
"
'
he
drew
quick
breaths
at
every
few
words
and
shot
quick
glances
at
my
face
,
as
though
in
his
anguish
he
were
watchful
of
the
effect
.
he
was
not
speaking
to
me
,
he
was
only
speaking
before
me
,
in
a
dispute
with
an
invisible
personality
,
an
antagonistic
and
inseparable
partner
of
his
existence
.

.
another
possessor
of
his
soul
.
these
were
issues
beyond
the
competency
of
a
court
of
inquiry
:
it
was
a
subtle
and
momentous
quarrel
as
to
the
true
essence
of
life
,
and
did
not
want
a
judge
.
he
wanted
an
ally
,
a
helper
,
an
accomplice
.
i
felt
the
risk
i
ran
of
being
circumvented
,
blinded
,
decoyed
,
bullied
,
perhaps
,
into
taking
a
definite
part
in
a
dispute
impossible
of
decision
if
one
had
to
be
fair
to
all
the
phantoms
in
possession
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
the
reputable
that
had
its
claims
and
to
the
disreputable
that
had
its
exigencies
.
i
ca
not
explain
to
you
who
have
not
seen
him
and
who
hear
his
words
only
at
second
hand
the
mixed
nature
of
my
feelings
.
it
seemed
to
me
i
was
being
made
to
comprehend
the
inconceivable
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
i
know
of
nothing
to
compare
with
the
discomfort
of
such
a
sensation
.
i
was
made
to
look
at
the
convention
that
lurks
in
all
truth
and
on
the
essential
sincerity
of
falsehood
.
he
appealed
to
all
sides
at
once
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
the
side
turned
perpetually
to
the
light
of
day
,
and
to
that
side
of
us
which
,
like
the
other
hemisphere
of
the
moon
,
exists
stealthily
in
perpetual
darkness
,
with
only
a
fearful
ashy
light
falling
at
times
on
the
edge
.
he
swayed
me
.
i
own
to
it
,
i
own
up
.
the
occasion
was
obscure
,
insignificant
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
what
you
will
:
a
lost
youngster
,
one
in
a
million
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
then
he
was
one
of
us
;
an
incident
as
completely
devoid
of
importance
as
the
flooding
of
an
ant
-
heap
,
and
yet
the
mystery
of
his
attitude
got
hold
of
me
as
though
he
had
been
an
individual
in
the
forefront
of
his
kind
,
as
if
the
obscure
truth
involved
were
momentous
enough
to
affect
mankind
'
s
conception
of
itself
.
'
marlow
paused
to
put
new
life
into
his
expiring
cheroot
,
seemed
to
forget
all
about
the
story
,
and
abruptly
began
again
.
'
my
fault
of
course
.
one
has
no
business
really
to
get
interested
.
it
is
a
weakness
of
mine
.
his
was
of
another
kind
.
my
weakness
consists
in
not
having
a
discriminating
eye
for
the
incidental
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
the
externals
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
no
eye
for
the
hod
of
the
rag
-
picker
or
the
fine
linen
of
the
next
man
.
next
man
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
'
s
it
.
i
have
met
so
many
men
,
'
he
pursued
,
with
momentary
sadness
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
'
met
them
too
with
a
certain
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
certain
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
impact
,
let
us
say
;
like
this
fellow
,
for
instance
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
in
each
case
all
i
could
see
was
merely
the
human
being
.
a
confounded
democratic
quality
of
vision
which
may
be
better
than
total
blindness
,
but
has
been
of
no
advantage
to
me
,
i
can
assure
you
.
men
expect
one
to
take
into
account
their
fine
linen
.
but
i
never
could
get
up
any
enthusiasm
about
these
things
.
oh
!
it
is
a
failing
;
it
is
a
failing
;
and
then
comes
a
soft
evening
;
a
lot
of
men
too
indolent
for
whist
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
a
story
.
'
he
paused
again
to
wait
for
an
encouraging
remark
,
perhaps
,
but
nobody
spoke
;
only
the
host
,
as
if
reluctantly
performing
a
duty
,
murmured
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
'
you
are
so
subtle
,
marlow
.
'
'
who
?
i
?
'
said
marlow
in
a
low
voice
.
'
oh
no
!
but
_
he
_
was
;
and
try
as
i
may
for
the
success
of
this
yarn
,
i
am
missing
innumerable
shades
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
they
were
so
fine
,
so
difficult
to
render
in
colourless
words
.
because
he
complicated
matters
by
being
so
simple
,
too
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
simplest
poor
devil
!
by
jove
!
he
was
amazing
.
there
he
sat
telling
me
that
just
as
i
saw
him
before
my
eyes
he
would
not
be
afraid
to
face
anything
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
believing
in
it
too
.
i
tell
you
it
was
fabulously
innocent
and
it
was
enormous
,
enormous
!
i
watched
him
covertly
,
just
as
though
i
had
suspected
him
of
an
intention
to
take
a
jolly
good
rise
out
of
me
.
he
was
confident
that
,
on
the
square
,
"
on
the
square
,
mind
!
"
there
was
nothing
he
could
not
meet
.
ever
since
he
had
been
"
so
high
"
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
quite
a
little
chap
,
"
he
had
been
preparing
himself
for
all
the
difficulties
that
can
beset
one
on
land
and
water
.
he
confessed
proudly
to
this
kind
of
foresight
.
he
had
been
elaborating
dangers
and
defences
,
expecting
the
worst
,
rehearsing
his
best
.
he
must
have
led
a
most
exalted
existence
.
can
you
fancy
it
?
a
succession
of
adventures
,
so
much
glory
,
such
a
victorious
progress
!
and
the
deep
sense
of
his
sagacity
crowning
every
day
of
his
inner
life
.
he
forgot
himself
;
his
eyes
shone
;
and
with
every
word
my
heart
,
searched
by
the
light
of
his
absurdity
,
was
growing
heavier
in
my
breast
.
i
had
no
mind
to
laugh
,
and
lest
i
should
smile
i
made
for
myself
a
stolid
face
.
he
gave
signs
of
irritation
.
"
it
is
always
the
unexpected
that
happens
,
"
i
said
in
a
propitiatory
tone
.
my
obtuseness
provoked
him
into
a
contemptuous
"
pshaw
!
"
i
suppose
he
meant
that
the
unexpected
could
not
touch
him
;
nothing
less
than
the
unconceivable
itself
could
get
over
his
perfect
state
of
preparation
.
he
had
been
taken
unawares
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
he
whispered
to
himself
a
malediction
upon
the
waters
and
the
firmament
,
upon
the
ship
,
upon
the
men
.
everything
had
betrayed
him
!
he
had
been
tricked
into
that
sort
of
high
-
minded
resignation
which
prevented
him
lifting
as
much
as
his
little
finger
,
while
these
others
who
had
a
very
clear
perception
of
the
actual
necessity
were
tumbling
against
each
other
and
sweating
desperately
over
that
boat
business
.
something
had
gone
wrong
there
at
the
last
moment
.
it
appears
that
in
their
flurry
they
had
contrived
in
some
mysterious
way
to
get
the
sliding
bolt
of
the
foremost
boat
-
chock
jammed
tight
,
and
forthwith
had
gone
out
of
the
remnants
of
their
minds
over
the
deadly
nature
of
that
accident
.
it
must
have
been
a
pretty
sight
,
the
fierce
industry
of
these
beggars
toiling
on
a
motionless
ship
that
floated
quietly
in
the
silence
of
a
world
asleep
,
fighting
against
time
for
the
freeing
of
that
boat
,
grovelling
on
all
-
fours
,
standing
up
in
despair
,
tugging
,
pushing
,
snarling
at
each
other
venomously
,
ready
to
kill
,
ready
to
weep
,
and
only
kept
from
flying
at
each
other
'
s
throats
by
the
fear
of
death
that
stood
silent
behind
them
like
an
inflexible
and
cold
-
eyed
taskmaster
.
oh
yes
!
it
must
have
been
a
pretty
sight
.
he
saw
it
all
,
he
could
talk
about
it
with
scorn
and
bitterness
;
he
had
a
minute
knowledge
of
it
by
means
of
some
sixth
sense
,
i
conclude
,
because
he
swore
to
me
he
had
remained
apart
without
a
glance
at
them
and
at
the
boat
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
without
one
single
glance
.
and
i
believe
him
.
i
should
think
he
was
too
busy
watching
the
threatening
slant
of
the
ship
,
the
suspended
menace
discovered
in
the
midst
of
the
most
perfect
security
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
fascinated
by
the
sword
hanging
by
a
hair
over
his
imaginative
head
.
'
nothing
in
the
world
moved
before
his
eyes
,
and
he
could
depict
to
himself
without
hindrance
the
sudden
swing
upwards
of
the
dark
sky
-
line
,
the
sudden
tilt
up
of
the
vast
plain
of
the
sea
,
the
swift
still
rise
,
the
brutal
fling
,
the
grasp
of
the
abyss
,
the
struggle
without
hope
,
the
starlight
closing
over
his
head
for
ever
like
the
vault
of
a
tomb
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
revolt
of
his
young
life
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
black
end
.
he
could
!
by
jove
!
who
couldn
'
t
?
and
you
must
remember
he
was
a
finished
artist
in
that
peculiar
way
,
he
was
a
gifted
poor
devil
with
the
faculty
of
swift
and
forestalling
vision
.
the
sights
it
showed
him
had
turned
him
into
cold
stone
from
the
soles
of
his
feet
to
the
nape
of
his
neck
;
but
there
was
a
hot
dance
of
thoughts
in
his
head
,
a
dance
of
lame
,
blind
,
mute
thoughts
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
whirl
of
awful
cripples
.
did
not
i
tell
you
he
confessed
himself
before
me
as
though
i
had
the
power
to
bind
and
to
loose
?
he
burrowed
deep
,
deep
,
in
the
hope
of
my
absolution
,
which
would
have
been
of
no
good
to
him
.
this
was
one
of
those
cases
which
no
solemn
deception
can
palliate
,
where
no
man
can
help
;
where
his
very
maker
seems
to
abandon
a
sinner
to
his
own
devices
.
'
he
stood
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
bridge
,
as
far
as
he
could
get
from
the
struggle
for
the
boat
,
which
went
on
with
the
agitation
of
madness
and
the
stealthiness
of
a
conspiracy
.
the
two
malays
had
meantime
remained
holding
to
the
wheel
.
just
picture
to
yourselves
the
actors
in
that
,
thank
god
!
unique
,
episode
of
the
sea
,
four
beside
themselves
with
fierce
and
secret
exertions
,
and
three
looking
on
in
complete
immobility
,
above
the
awnings
covering
the
profound
ignorance
of
hundreds
of
human
beings
,
with
their
weariness
,
with
their
dreams
,
with
their
hopes
,
arrested
,
held
by
an
invisible
hand
on
the
brink
of
annihilation
.
for
that
they
were
so
,
makes
no
doubt
to
me
:
given
the
state
of
the
ship
,
this
was
the
deadliest
possible
description
of
accident
that
could
happen
.
these
beggars
by
the
boat
had
every
reason
to
go
distracted
with
funk
.
frankly
,
had
i
been
there
,
i
would
not
have
given
as
much
as
a
counterfeit
farthing
for
the
ship
'
s
chance
to
keep
above
water
to
the
end
of
each
successive
second
.
and
still
she
floated
!
these
sleeping
pilgrims
were
destined
to
accomplish
their
whole
pilgrimage
to
the
bitterness
of
some
other
end
.
it
was
as
if
the
omnipotence
whose
mercy
they
confessed
had
needed
their
humble
testimony
on
earth
for
a
while
longer
,
and
had
looked
down
to
make
a
sign
,
"
thou
shalt
not
!
"
to
the
ocean
.
their
escape
would
trouble
me
as
a
prodigiously
inexplicable
event
,
did
i
not
know
how
tough
old
iron
can
be
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
tough
sometimes
as
the
spirit
of
some
men
we
meet
now
and
then
,
worn
to
a
shadow
and
breasting
the
weight
of
life
.
not
the
least
wonder
of
these
twenty
minutes
,
to
my
mind
,
is
the
behaviour
of
the
two
helmsmen
.
they
were
amongst
the
native
batch
of
all
sorts
brought
over
from
aden
to
give
evidence
at
the
inquiry
.
one
of
them
,
labouring
under
intense
bashfulness
,
was
very
young
,
and
with
his
smooth
,
yellow
,
cheery
countenance
looked
even
younger
than
he
was
.
i
remember
perfectly
brierly
asking
him
,
through
the
interpreter
,
what
he
thought
of
it
at
the
time
,
and
the
interpreter
,
after
a
short
colloquy
,
turning
to
the
court
with
an
important
air
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
he
says
he
thought
nothing
.
"
'
the
other
,
with
patient
blinking
eyes
,
a
blue
cotton
handkerchief
,
faded
with
much
washing
,
bound
with
a
smart
twist
over
a
lot
of
grey
wisps
,
his
face
shrunk
into
grim
hollows
,
his
brown
skin
made
darker
by
a
mesh
of
wrinkles
,
explained
that
he
had
a
knowledge
of
some
evil
thing
befalling
the
ship
,
but
there
had
been
no
order
;
he
could
not
remember
an
order
;
why
should
he
leave
the
helm
?
to
some
further
questions
he
jerked
back
his
spare
shoulders
,
and
declared
it
never
came
into
his
mind
then
that
the
white
men
were
about
to
leave
the
ship
through
fear
of
death
.
he
did
not
believe
it
now
.
there
might
have
been
secret
reasons
.
he
wagged
his
old
chin
knowingly
.
aha
!
secret
reasons
.
he
was
a
man
of
great
experience
,
and
he
wanted
that
white
tuan
to
know
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
he
turned
towards
brierly
,
who
did
not
raise
his
head
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
he
had
acquired
a
knowledge
of
many
things
by
serving
white
men
on
the
sea
for
a
great
number
of
years
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
,
suddenly
,
with
shaky
excitement
he
poured
upon
our
spellbound
attention
a
lot
of
queer
-
sounding
names
,
names
of
dead
-
and
-
gone
skippers
,
names
of
forgotten
country
ships
,
names
of
familiar
and
distorted
sound
,
as
if
the
hand
of
dumb
time
had
been
at
work
on
them
for
ages
.
they
stopped
him
at
last
.
a
silence
fell
upon
the
court
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
silence
that
remained
unbroken
for
at
least
a
minute
,
and
passed
gently
into
a
deep
murmur
.
this
episode
was
the
sensation
of
the
second
day
'
s
proceedings
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
affecting
all
the
audience
,
affecting
everybody
except
jim
,
who
was
sitting
moodily
at
the
end
of
the
first
bench
,
and
never
looked
up
at
this
extraordinary
and
damning
witness
that
seemed
possessed
of
some
mysterious
theory
of
defence
.
'
so
these
two
lascars
stuck
to
the
helm
of
that
ship
without
steerage
-
way
,
where
death
would
have
found
them
if
such
had
been
their
destiny
.
the
whites
did
not
give
them
half
a
glance
,
had
probably
forgotten
their
existence
.
assuredly
jim
did
not
remember
it
.
he
remembered
he
could
do
nothing
;
he
could
do
nothing
,
now
he
was
alone
.
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
sink
with
the
ship
.
no
use
making
a
disturbance
about
it
.
was
there
?
he
waited
upstanding
,
without
a
sound
,
stiffened
in
the
idea
of
some
sort
of
heroic
discretion
.
the
first
engineer
ran
cautiously
across
the
bridge
to
tug
at
his
sleeve
.
"
come
and
help
!
for
god
'
s
sake
,
come
and
help
!
"
'
he
ran
back
to
the
boat
on
the
points
of
his
toes
,
and
returned
directly
to
worry
at
his
sleeve
,
begging
and
cursing
at
the
same
time
.
"
i
believe
he
would
have
kissed
my
hands
,
"
said
jim
savagely
,
"
and
,
next
moment
,
he
starts
foaming
and
whispering
in
my
face
,
'
if
i
had
the
time
i
would
like
to
crack
your
skull
for
you
.
'
i
pushed
him
away
.
suddenly
he
caught
hold
of
me
round
the
neck
.
damn
him
!
i
hit
him
.
i
hit
out
without
looking
.
'
wo
not
you
save
your
own
life
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
infernal
coward
?
'
he
sobs
.
coward
!
he
called
me
an
infernal
coward
!
ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
he
called
me
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
"
'
he
had
thrown
himself
back
and
was
shaking
with
laughter
.
i
had
never
in
my
life
heard
anything
so
bitter
as
that
noise
.
it
fell
like
a
blight
on
all
the
merriment
about
donkeys
,
pyramids
,
bazaars
,
or
what
not
.
along
the
whole
dim
length
of
the
gallery
the
voices
dropped
,
the
pale
blotches
of
faces
turned
our
way
with
one
accord
,
and
the
silence
became
so
profound
that
the
clear
tinkle
of
a
teaspoon
falling
on
the
tesselated
floor
of
the
verandah
rang
out
like
a
tiny
and
silvery
scream
.
"
you
must
not
laugh
like
this
,
with
all
these
people
about
,
"
i
remonstrated
.
it
is
not
nice
for
them
,
you
know
.
"
'
he
gave
no
sign
of
having
heard
at
first
,
but
after
a
while
,
with
a
stare
that
,
missing
me
altogether
,
seemed
to
probe
the
heart
of
some
awful
vision
,
he
muttered
carelessly
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
oh
!
they
will
think
i
am
drunk
.
"
'
and
after
that
you
would
have
thought
from
his
appearance
he
would
never
make
a
sound
again
.
but
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
no
fear
!
he
could
no
more
stop
telling
now
than
he
could
have
stopped
living
by
the
mere
exertion
of
his
will
.
'
"
i
was
saying
to
myself
,
'
sink
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
curse
you
!
sink
!
'
these
were
the
words
with
which
he
began
again
.
he
wanted
it
over
.
he
was
severely
left
alone
,
and
he
formulated
in
his
head
this
address
to
the
ship
in
a
tone
of
imprecation
,
while
at
the
same
time
he
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
witnessing
scenes
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
far
as
i
can
judge
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
of
low
comedy
.
they
were
still
at
that
bolt
.
the
skipper
was
ordering
,
"
get
under
and
try
to
lift
"
;
and
the
others
naturally
shirked
.
you
understand
that
to
be
squeezed
flat
under
the
keel
of
a
boat
was
not
a
desirable
position
to
be
caught
in
if
the
ship
went
down
suddenly
.
"
why
do
not
you
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
the
strongest
?
"
whined
the
little
engineer
.
"
gott
-
for
-
dam
!
i
am
too
thick
,
"
spluttered
the
skipper
in
despair
.
it
was
funny
enough
to
make
angels
weep
.
they
stood
idle
for
a
moment
,
and
suddenly
the
chief
engineer
rushed
again
at
jim
.
"
come
and
help
,
man
!
are
you
mad
to
throw
your
only
chance
away
?
come
and
help
,
man
!
man
!
look
there
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
look
!
"
'
and
at
last
jim
looked
astern
where
the
other
pointed
with
maniacal
insistence
.
he
saw
a
silent
black
squall
which
had
eaten
up
already
one
-
third
of
the
sky
.
you
know
how
these
squalls
come
up
there
about
that
time
of
the
year
.
first
you
see
a
darkening
of
the
horizon
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
no
more
;
then
a
cloud
rises
opaque
like
a
wall
.
a
straight
edge
of
vapour
lined
with
sickly
whitish
gleams
flies
up
from
the
southwest
,
swallowing
the
stars
in
whole
constellations
;
its
shadow
flies
over
the
waters
,
and
confounds
sea
and
sky
into
one
abyss
of
obscurity
.
and
all
is
still
.
no
thunder
,
no
wind
,
no
sound
;
not
a
flicker
of
lightning
.
then
in
the
tenebrous
immensity
a
livid
arch
appears
;
a
swell
or
two
like
undulations
of
the
very
darkness
run
past
,
and
suddenly
,
wind
and
rain
strike
together
with
a
peculiar
impetuosity
as
if
they
had
burst
through
something
solid
.
such
a
cloud
had
come
up
while
they
were
not
looking
.
they
had
just
noticed
it
,
and
were
perfectly
justified
in
surmising
that
if
in
absolute
stillness
there
was
some
chance
for
the
ship
to
keep
afloat
a
few
minutes
longer
,
the
least
disturbance
of
the
sea
would
make
an
end
of
her
instantly
.
her
first
nod
to
the
swell
that
precedes
the
burst
of
such
a
squall
would
be
also
her
last
,
would
become
a
plunge
,
would
,
so
to
speak
,
be
prolonged
into
a
long
dive
,
down
,
down
to
the
bottom
.
hence
these
new
capers
of
their
fright
,
these
new
antics
in
which
they
displayed
their
extreme
aversion
to
die
.
"
it
was
black
,
black
,
"
pursued
jim
with
moody
steadiness
.
it
had
sneaked
upon
us
from
behind
.
the
infernal
thing
!
i
suppose
there
had
been
at
the
back
of
my
head
some
hope
yet
.
i
do
not
know
.
but
that
was
all
over
anyhow
.
it
maddened
me
to
see
myself
caught
like
this
.
i
was
angry
,
as
though
i
had
been
trapped
.
i
_
was
_
trapped
!
the
night
was
hot
,
too
,
i
remember
.
not
a
breath
of
air
.
"
'
he
remembered
so
well
that
,
gasping
in
the
chair
,
he
seemed
to
sweat
and
choke
before
my
eyes
.
no
doubt
it
maddened
him
;
it
knocked
him
over
afresh
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
in
a
manner
of
speaking
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
it
made
him
also
remember
that
important
purpose
which
had
sent
him
rushing
on
that
bridge
only
to
slip
clean
out
of
his
mind
.
he
had
intended
to
cut
the
lifeboats
clear
of
the
ship
.
he
whipped
out
his
knife
and
went
to
work
slashing
as
though
he
had
seen
nothing
,
had
heard
nothing
,
had
known
of
no
one
on
board
.
they
thought
him
hopelessly
wrong
-
headed
and
crazy
,
but
dared
not
protest
noisily
against
this
useless
loss
of
time
.
when
he
had
done
he
returned
to
the
very
same
spot
from
which
he
had
started
.
the
chief
was
there
,
ready
with
a
clutch
at
him
to
whisper
close
to
his
head
,
scathingly
,
as
though
he
wanted
to
bite
his
ear
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"

silly
fool

brutes

batter
your

he
wrung
his
hands
,

,
at
jim
'
s
elbow

the
skipper
kept
up
a
nervous
shuffle
in
one
place
and
mumbled
,

"
'
the
little
engineer
whimpered
like
a
child
,

,
broken
arm
and
all
,
he
turned
out
the
least
craven
of
the
lot
as
it
seems
,
and
,
actually
,
mustered
enough
pluck
to
run
an
errand
to
the
engine
-
room
.
no
trifle
,
it
must
be
owned
in
fairness
to
him
.
jim
told
me
he
darted
desperate
looks
like
a
cornered
man
,
gave
one
low
wail
,
and
dashed
off
.
he
was
back
instantly
clambering
,
hammer
in
hand
,
and
without
a
pause
flung
himself
at
the
bolt
.
the
others
gave
up
jim
at
once
and
ran
off
to
assist
.

heard
the
tap
,
tap
of
the
hammer
,
the
sound
of
the
released
chock
falling
over
.
the
boat
was
clear

then
he
turned
to
look
.

he
kept
his
distance

kept
his
distance

wanted
me
to
know

his
distance

that
there
was
nothing
in
common

men

.
.

who
had
the

nothing

himself

off
from

by
a
space
that
could
not
be
traversed
,
by
an
obstacle
that
could
not
be
overcome
,
by
a
chasm
without
bottom
.
he
was
as
far
as
he
could
get
from
them
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
whole
breadth
of
the
ship
.
'
his
feet
were
glued
to
that
remote
spot
and
his
eyes
to
their
indistinct
group
bowed
together
and
swaying
strangely
in
the
common
torment
of
fear
.
a
hand
-
lamp
lashed
to
a
stanchion
above
a
little
table
rigged
up
on
the
bridge
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
patna
had
no
chart
-
room
amidships
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
threw
a
light
on
their
labouring
shoulders
,
on
their
arched
and
bobbing
backs
.
they
pushed
at
the
bow
of
the
boat
;
they
pushed
out
into
the
night
;
they
pushed
,
and
would
no
more
look
back
at
him
.
they
had
given
him
up
as
if
indeed
he
had
been
too
far
,
too
hopelessly
separated
from
themselves
,
to
be
worth
an
appealing
word
,
a
glance
,
or
a
sign
.
they
had
no
leisure
to
look
back
upon
his
passive
heroism
,
to
feel
the
sting
of
his
abstention
.
the
boat
was
heavy
;
they
pushed
at
the
bow
with
no
breath
to
spare
for
an
encouraging
word
:
but
the
turmoil
of
terror
that
had
scattered
their
self
-
command
like
chaff
before
the
wind
,
converted
their
desperate
exertions
into
a
bit
of
fooling
,
upon
my
word
,
fit
for
knockabout
clowns
in
a
farce
.
they
pushed
with
their
hands
,
with
their
heads
,
they
pushed
for
dear
life
with
all
the
weight
of
their
bodies
,
they
pushed
with
all
the
might
of
their
souls
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
only
no
sooner
had
they
succeeded
in
canting
the
stem
clear
of
the
davit
than
they
would
leave
off
like
one
man
and
start
a
wild
scramble
into
her
.
as
a
natural
consequence
the
boat
would
swing
in
abruptly
,
driving
them
back
,
helpless
and
jostling
against
each
other
.
they
would
stand
nonplussed
for
a
while
,
exchanging
in
fierce
whispers
all
the
infamous
names
they
could
call
to
mind
,
and
go
at
it
again
.
three
times
this
occurred
.
he
described
it
to
me
with
morose
thoughtfulness
.
he
had
not
lost
a
single
movement
of
that
comic
business
.
i
loathed
them
.
i
hated
them
.
i
had
to
look
at
all
that
,
"
he
said
without
emphasis
,
turning
upon
me
a
sombrely
watchful
glance
.
was
ever
there
any
one
so
shamefully
tried
?
"
'
he
took
his
head
in
his
hands
for
a
moment
,
like
a
man
driven
to
distraction
by
some
unspeakable
outrage
.
these
were
things
he
could
not
explain
to
the
court
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
not
even
to
me
;
but
i
would
have
been
little
fitted
for
the
reception
of
his
confidences
had
i
not
been
able
at
times
to
understand
the
pauses
between
the
words
.
in
this
assault
upon
his
fortitude
there
was
the
jeering
intention
of
a
spiteful
and
vile
vengeance
;
there
was
an
element
of
burlesque
in
his
ordeal
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
degradation
of
funny
grimaces
in
the
approach
of
death
or
dishonour
.
'
he
related
facts
which
i
have
not
forgotten
,
but
at
this
distance
of
time
i
could
not
recall
his
very
words
:
i
only
remember
that
he
managed
wonderfully
to
convey
the
brooding
rancour
of
his
mind
into
the
bare
recital
of
events
.
twice
,
he
told
me
,
he
shut
his
eyes
in
the
certitude
that
the
end
was
upon
him
already
,
and
twice
he
had
to
open
them
again
.
each
time
he
noted
the
darkening
of
the
great
stillness
.
the
shadow
of
the
silent
cloud
had
fallen
upon
the
ship
from
the
zenith
,
and
seemed
to
have
extinguished
every
sound
of
her
teeming
life
.
he
could
no
longer
hear
the
voices
under
the
awnings
.
he
told
me
that
each
time
he
closed
his
eyes
a
flash
of
thought
showed
him
that
crowd
of
bodies
,
laid
out
for
death
,
as
plain
as
daylight
.
when
he
opened
them
,
it
was
to
see
the
dim
struggle
of
four
men
fighting
like
mad
with
a
stubborn
boat
.
they
would
fall
back
before
it
time
after
time
,
stand
swearing
at
each
other
,
and
suddenly
make
another
rush
in
a
bunch
.
enough
to
make
you
die
laughing
,
"
he
commented
with
downcast
eyes
;
then
raising
them
for
a
moment
to
my
face
with
a
dismal
smile
,
"
i
ought
to
have
a
merry
life
of
it
,
by
god
!
for
i
shall
see
that
funny
sight
a
good
many
times
yet
before
i
die
.
"
his
eyes
fell
again
.
see
and
hear
.
see
and
hear
,
"
he
repeated
twice
,
at
long
intervals
,
filled
by
vacant
staring
.
'
he
roused
himself
.
"
i
made
up
my
mind
to
keep
my
eyes
shut
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
i
couldn
'
t
.
i
couldn
'
t
,
and
i
do
not
care
who
knows
it
.
let
them
go
through
that
kind
of
thing
before
they
talk
.
just
let
them
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
do
better
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
'
s
all
.
the
second
time
my
eyelids
flew
open
and
my
mouth
too
.
i
had
felt
the
ship
move
.
she
just
dipped
her
bows
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
lifted
them
gently
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
slow
!
everlastingly
slow
;
and
ever
so
little
.
she
had
not
done
that
much
for
days
.
the
cloud
had
raced
ahead
,
and
this
first
swell
seemed
to
travel
upon
a
sea
of
lead
.
there
was
no
life
in
that
stir
.
it
managed
,
though
,
to
knock
over
something
in
my
head
.
what
would
you
have
done
?
you
are
sure
of
yourself
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
are
not
you
?
what
would
you
do
if
you
felt
now
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
this
minute
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
house
here
move
,
just
move
a
little
under
your
chair
.
leap
!
by
heavens
!
you
would
take
one
spring
from
where
you
sit
and
land
in
that
clump
of
bushes
yonder
.
"
'
he
flung
his
arm
out
at
the
night
beyond
the
stone
balustrade
.
i
held
my
peace
.
he
looked
at
me
very
steadily
,
very
severe
.
there
could
be
no
mistake
:
i
was
being
bullied
now
,
and
it
behoved
me
to
make
no
sign
lest
by
a
gesture
or
a
word
i
should
be
drawn
into
a
fatal
admission
about
myself
which
would
have
had
some
bearing
on
the
case
.
i
was
not
disposed
to
take
any
risk
of
that
sort
.
do
not
forget
i
had
him
before
me
,
and
really
he
was
too
much
like
one
of
us
not
to
be
dangerous
.
but
if
you
want
to
know
i
do
not
mind
telling
you
that
i
did
,
with
a
rapid
glance
,
estimate
the
distance
to
the
mass
of
denser
blackness
in
the
middle
of
the
grass
-
plot
before
the
verandah
.
he
exaggerated
.
i
would
have
landed
short
by
several
feet
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
that
'
s
the
only
thing
of
which
i
am
fairly
certain
.
'
the
last
moment
had
come
,
as
he
thought
,
and
he
did
not
move
.
his
feet
remained
glued
to
the
planks
if
his
thoughts
were
knocking
about
loose
in
his
head
.
it
was
at
this
moment
too
that
he
saw
one
of
the
men
around
the
boat
step
backwards
suddenly
,
clutch
at
the
air
with
raised
arms
,
totter
and
collapse
.
he
did
not
exactly
fall
,
he
only
slid
gently
into
a
sitting
posture
,
all
hunched
up
,
and
with
his
shoulders
propped
against
the
side
of
the
engine
-
room
skylight
.
"
that
was
the
donkey
-
man
.
a
haggard
,
white
-
faced
chap
with
a
ragged
moustache
.
acted
third
engineer
,
"
he
explained
.
"
dead
,
"
i
said
.
we
had
heard
something
of
that
in
court
.
"
so
they
say
,
"
he
pronounced
with
sombre
indifference
.
of
course
i
never
knew
.
weak
heart
.
the
man
had
been
complaining
of
being
out
of
sorts
for
some
time
before
.
excitement
.
over
-
exertion
.
devil
only
knows
.
ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
it
was
easy
to
see
he
did
not
want
to
die
either
.
droll
,
is
not
it
?
may
i
be
shot
if
he
had
not
been
fooled
into
killing
himself
!
fooled
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
neither
more
nor
less
.
fooled
into
it
,
by
heavens
!
just
as
i
ah
!
if
he
had
only
kept
still
;
if
he
had
only
told
them
to
go
to
the
devil
when
they
came
to
rush
him
out
of
his
bunk
because
the
ship
was
sinking
!
if
he
had
only
stood
by
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
called
them
names
!
"
'
he
got
up
,
shook
his
fist
,
glared
at
me
,
and
sat
down
.
a
chance
missed
,
eh
?
"
i
murmured
.
why
do
not
you
laugh
?
"
he
said
.
a
joke
hatched
in
hell
.
weak
heart
!
i
wish
sometimes
mine
had
been
.
"
'
this
irritated
me
.
do
you
?
"
i
exclaimed
with
deep
-
rooted
irony
.
yes
!
ca
not
_
you
_
understand
?
"
he
cried
.
i
do
not
know
what
more
you
could
wish
for
,
"
i
said
angrily
.
he
gave
me
an
utterly
uncomprehending
glance
.
this
shaft
had
also
gone
wide
of
the
mark
,
and
he
was
not
the
man
to
bother
about
stray
arrows
.
upon
my
word
,
he
was
too
unsuspecting
;
he
was
not
fair
game
.
i
was
glad
that
my
missile
had
been
thrown
away
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
he
had
not
even
heard
the
twang
of
the
bow
.
'
of
course
he
could
not
know
at
the
time
the
man
was
dead
.
the
next
minute
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
his
last
on
board
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
was
crowded
with
a
tumult
of
events
and
sensations
which
beat
about
him
like
the
sea
upon
a
rock
.
i
use
the
simile
advisedly
,
because
from
his
relation
i
am
forced
to
believe
he
had
preserved
through
it
all
a
strange
illusion
of
passiveness
,
as
though
he
had
not
acted
but
had
suffered
himself
to
be
handled
by
the
infernal
powers
who
had
selected
him
for
the
victim
of
their
practical
joke
.
the
first
thing
that
came
to
him
was
the
grinding
surge
of
the
heavy
davits
swinging
out
at
last
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
jar
which
seemed
to
enter
his
body
from
the
deck
through
the
soles
of
his
feet
,
and
travel
up
his
spine
to
the
crown
of
his
head
.
then
,
the
squall
being
very
near
now
,
another
and
a
heavier
swell
lifted
the
passive
hull
in
a
threatening
heave
that
checked
his
breath
,
while
his
brain
and
his
heart
together
were
pierced
as
with
daggers
by
panic
-
stricken
screams
.
let
go
!
for
god
'
s
sake
,
let
go
!
let
go
!
she
is
going
.
"
following
upon
that
the
boat
-
falls
ripped
through
the
blocks
,
and
a
lot
of
men
began
to
talk
in
startled
tones
under
the
awnings
.
when
these
beggars
did
break
out
,
their
yelps
were
enough
to
wake
the
dead
,
"
he
said
.
next
,
after
the
splashing
shock
of
the
boat
literally
dropped
in
the
water
,
came
the
hollow
noises
of
stamping
and
tumbling
in
her
,
mingled
with
confused
shouts
:
"
unhook
!
unhook
!
shove
!
unhook
!
shove
for
your
life
