you
can
guess
on
what
part
of
his
adventures
the
colonel
principally
dwelled
.
indeed
,
if
we
had
heard
it
all
,
it
is
to
be
thought
the
current
of
this
business
had
been
wholly
altered
;
but
the
pirate
ship
was
very
gently
touched
upon
.
nor
did
i
hear
the
colonel
to
an
end
even
of
that
which
he
was
willing
to
disclose
;
for
mr
henry
,
having
for
some
while
been
plunged
in
a
brown
study
,
rose
at
last
from
his
seat
and
(
reminding
the
colonel
there
were
matters
that
he
must
attend
to
)
bade
me
follow
him
immediately
to
the
office
.
once
there
,
he
sought
no
longer
to
dissemble
his
concern
,
walking
to
and
fro
in
the
room
with
a
contorted
face
,
and
passing
his
hand
repeatedly
upon
his
brow
.
"
we
have
some
business
,
"
he
began
at
last
;
and
there
broke
off
,
declared
we
must
have
wine
,
and
sent
for
a
magnum
of
the
best
.
this
was
extremely
foreign
to
his
habitudes
;
and
what
was
still
more
so
,
when
the
wine
had
come
,
he
gulped
down
one
glass
upon
another
like
a
man
careless
of
appearances
.
but
the
drink
steadied
him
.
"
you
will
scarce
be
surprised
,
mackellar
,
"
says
he
,
"
when
i
tell
you
that
my
brother
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
whose
safety
we
are
all
rejoiced
to
learn
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
stands
in
some
need
of
money
.
"
i
told
him
i
had
misdoubted
as
much
;
but
the
time
was
not
very
fortunate
,
as
the
stock
was
low
.
"
not
mine
,
"
said
he
.
"
there
is
the
money
for
the
mortgage
.
"
i
reminded
him
it
was
mrs
henry
'
s
.
"
i
will
be
answerable
to
my
wife
,
"
he
cried
violently
.
"
and
then
,
"
said
i
,
"
there
is
the
mortgage
.
"
"
i
know
,
"
said
he
;
"
it
is
on
that
i
would
consult
you
.
"
i
showed
him
how
unfortunate
a
time
it
was
to
divert
this
money
from
its
destination
;
and
how
,
by
so
doing
,
we
must
lose
the
profit
of
our
past
economies
,
and
plunge
back
the
estate
into
the
mire
.
i
even
took
the
liberty
to
plead
with
him
;
and
when
he
still
opposed
me
with
a
shake
of
the
head
and
a
bitter
dogged
smile
,
my
zeal
quite
carried
me
beyond
my
place
.
"
this
is
midsummer
madness
,
"
cried
i
;
"
and
i
for
one
will
be
no
party
to
it
.
"
"
you
speak
as
though
i
did
it
for
my
pleasure
,
"
says
he
.
"
but
i
have
a
child
now
;
and
,
besides
,
i
love
order
;

to
say
the
honest
truth
,
mackellar
,
i
had
begun
to
take
a
pride
in
the
estates
.
"
he
gloomed
for
a
moment
.
"
but
what
would
you
have
?
"
he
went
on
.
"

mine

day

news
has
knocked
the

the
shadow

the
shadow

"
"

prove
substantial

said
i
.
he
looked
at
me
with
a
burning
eye
,
and
seemed
to
repress
the
word
upon
his
lips
;
and
i
repented
what
i
had
said
,
for
i
saw
that
while
he
spoke
of
the
estate
he
had
still
a
side
-
thought
to
his
marriage
.
and
then
,
of
a
sudden
,
he
twitched
the
letter
from
his
pocket
,
where
it
lay
all
crumpled
,
smoothed
it
violently
on
the
table
,
and
read
these
words
to
me
with
a
trembling
tongue
:
"

cries
he
.

.
.
.
.
"
'
my

once
called
you
so

may
remember

now
done

high

,

only
brother

i
declare
to
god
i
liked
him
very
well
;
i
was
always
staunch
to
him
;
and
this
is
how
he
writes
!

i
will
not
sit
down
under

on
god

prove
it

i
cannot
give
him
all
the
monstrous
sum
he
asks
;
he
knows
the
estate
to
be
incompetent
;
but
i
will
give
him
what
i
have
,
and
it
in
more
than
he
expects
.
i
have
borne
all
this
too
long
.
see
what
he
writes
further
on
;
read
it
for
yourself
:
'

a

niggardly

is
that
true
,
mackellar
?
you
think
it
is
?
"
i
really
thought
he
would
have
struck
me
at
that
.
"
oh
,
you
all
think
so
!
well
,
you
shall
see
,

he
shall
see

god
shall
see
.
if
i
ruin
the
estate

go
barefoot
,
i
shall
stuff
this
bloodsucker

him
ask
all
.

all
,

he
shall
have
it

all
his

rights

ah
!
"
he
cried
,
"
and
i
foresaw
all
this
,
and
worse
,
when
he
would
not
let
me
go
.
"
he
poured
out
another
glass
of
wine
,
and
was
about
to
carry
it
to
his
lips
,
when
i
made
so
bold
as
to
lay
a
finger
on
his
arm
.
he
stopped
a
moment
.
"
you
are
right
,
"
said
he
,
and
flung
glass
and
all
in
the
fireplace
.
"
come
,
let
us
count
the
money
.
"
i
durst
no
longer
oppose
him
;
indeed
,
i
was
very
much
affected
by
the
sight
of
so
much
disorder
in
a
man
usually
so
controlled
;
and
we
sat
down
together
,
counted
the
money
,
and
made
it
up
in
packets
for
the
greater
ease
of
colonel
burke
,
who
was
to
be
the
bearer
.
this
done
,
mr
henry
returned
to
the
hall
,
where
he
and
my
old
lord
sat
all
night
through
with
their
guest
.
a
little
before
dawn
i
was
called
and
set
out
with
the
colonel
.
he
would
scarce
have
liked
a
less
responsible
convoy
,
for
he
was
a
man
who
valued
himself
;
nor
could
we
afford
him
one
more
dignified
,
for
mr
henry
must
not
appear
with
the
freetraders
.
it
was
a
very
bitter
morning
of
wind
,
and
as
we
went
down
through
the
long
shrubbery
the
colonel
held
himself
muffled
in
his
cloak
.
"
sir
,
"
said
i
,
"
this
is
a
great
sum
of
money
that
your
friend
requires
.
i
must
suppose
his
necessities
to
be
very
great
.
"
"
we
must
suppose
so
,
"
says
he
,
i
thought
drily
;
but
perhaps
it
was
the
cloak
about
his
mouth
.
"
i
am
only
a
servant
of
the
family
,
"
said
i
.
"
you
may
deal
openly
with
me
.
i
think
we
are
likely
to
get
little
good
by
him
?
"
"
my
dear
man
,
"
said
the
colonel
,
"
ballantrae
is
a
gentleman
of
the
most
eminent
natural
abilities
,
and
a
man
that
i
admire
,
and
that
i
revere
,
to
the
very
ground
he
treads
on
.
"
and
then
he
seemed
to
me
to
pause
like
one
in
a
difficulty
.
"
but
for
all
that
,
"
said
i
,
"
we
are
likely
to
get
little
good
by
him
?
"
"
sure
,
and
you
can
have
it
your
own
way
,
my
dear
man
,
"
says
the
colonel
.
by
this
time
we
had
come
to
the
side
of
the
creek
,
where
the
boat
awaited
him
.
"
well
,
"
said
be
,
"
i
am
sure
i
am
very
much
your
debtor
for
all
your
civility
,
mr
whatever
-
your

name

is
;
and
just
as
a
last
word
,
and
since
you
show
so
much
intelligent
interest
,
i
will
mention
a
small
circumstance
that
may
be
of
use
to
the
family
.
for
i
believe
my
friend
omitted
to
mention
that
he
has
the
largest
pension
on
the
scots
fund
of
any
refugee
in
paris
;
and
it
is
the
more
disgraceful
,
sir
,
"
cries
the
colonel
,
warming
,
"
because
there
'
s
not
one
dirty
penny
for
myself
.
"
he
cocked
his
hat
at
me
,
as
if
i
had
been
to
blame
for
this
partiality
;
then
changed
again
into
his
usual
swaggering
civility
,
shook
me
by
the
hand
,
and
set
off
down
to
the
boat
,
with
the
money
under
his
arms
,
and
whistling
as
he
went
the
pathetic
air
of
shule
aroon
.
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
that
tune
;
i
was
to
hear
it
again
,
words
and
all
,
as
you
shall
learn
,
but
i
remember
how
that
little
stave
of
it
ran
in
my
head
after
the
freetraders
had
bade
him
"
wheesht
,
in
the
deil
'
s
name
,
"
and
the
grating
of
the
oars
had
taken
its
place
,
and
i
stood
and
watched
the
dawn
creeping
on
the
sea
,
and
the
boat
drawing
away
,
and
the
lugger
lying
with
her
foresail
backed
awaiting
it
.
the
gap
made
in
our
money
was
a
sore
embarrassment
,
and
,
among
other
consequences
,
it
had
this
:
that
i
must
ride
to
edinburgh
,
and
there
raise
a
new
loan
on
very
questionable
terms
to
keep
the
old
afloat
;
and
was
thus
,
for
close
upon
three
weeks
,
absent
from
the
house
of
durrisdeer
.
what
passed
in
the
interval
i
had
none
to
tell
me
,
but
i
found
mrs
henry
,
upon
my
return
,
much
changed
in
her
demeanour
.
the
old
talks
with
my
lord
for
the
most
part
pretermitted
;
a
certain
deprecation
visible
towards
her
husband
,
to
whom
i
thought
she
addressed
herself
more
often
;
and
,
for
one
thing
,
she
was
now
greatly
wrapped
up
in
miss
katharine
.
you
would
think
the
change
was
agreeable
to
mr
henry
;
no
such
matter
!
to
the
contrary
,
every
circumstance
of
alteration
was
a
stab
to
him
;
he
read
in
each
the
avowal
of
her
truant
fancies
.
that
constancy
to
the
master
of
which
she
was
proud
while
she
supposed
him
dead
,
she
had
to
blush
for
now
she
knew
he
was
alive
,
and
these
blushes
were
the
hated
spring
of
her
new
conduct
.
i
am
to
conceal
no
truth
;
and
i
will
here
say
plainly
,
i
think
this
was
the
period
in
which
mr
henry
showed
the
worst
.
he
contained
himself
,
indeed
,
in
public
;
but
there
was
a
deep
-
seated
irritation
visible
underneath
.
with
me
,
from
whom
he
had
less
concealment
,
he
was
often
grossly
unjust
,
and
even
for
his
wife
he
would
sometimes
have
a
sharp
retort
:
perhaps
when
she
had
ruffled
him
with
some
unwonted
kindness
;
perhaps
upon
no
tangible
occasion
,
the
mere
habitual
tenor
of
the
man
'
s
annoyance
bursting
spontaneously
forth
.
when
he
would
thus
forget
himself
(
a
thing
so
strangely
out
of
keeping
with
the
terms
of
their
relation
)
,
there
went
a
shook
through
the
whole
company
,
and
the
pair
would
look
upon
each
other
in
a
kind
of
pained
amazement
.
all
the
time
,
too
,
while
he
was
injuring
himself
by
this
defect
of
temper
,
he
was
hurting
his
position
by
a
silence
,
of
which
i
scarce
know
whether
to
say
it
was
the
child
of
generosity
or
pride
.
the
freetraders
came
again
and
again
,
bringing
messengers
from
the
master
,
and
none
departed
empty
-
handed
.
i
never
durst
reason
with
mr
henry
;
he
gave
what
was
asked
of
him
in
a
kind
of
noble
rage
.
perhaps
because
he
knew
he
was
by
nature
inclining
to
the
parsimonious
,
he
took
a
backforemost
pleasure
in
the
recklessness
with
which
he
supplied
his
brother
'
s
exigence
.
perhaps
the
falsity
of
the
position
would
have
spurred
a
humbler
man
into
the
same
excess
.
but
the
estate
(
if
i
may
say
so
)
groaned
under
it
;
our
daily
expenses
were
shorn
lower
and
lower
;
the
stables
were
emptied
,
all
but
four
roadsters
;
servants
were
discharged
,
which
raised
a
dreadful
murmuring
in
the
country
,
and
heated
up
the
old
disfavour
upon
mr
henry
;
and
at
last
the
yearly
visit
to
edinburgh
must
be
discontinued
.
this
was
in
1756
.
you
are
to
suppose
that
for
seven
years
this
bloodsucker
had
been
drawing
the
life
'
s
blood
from
durrisdeer
,
and
that
all
this
time
my
patron
had
held
his
peace
.
it
was
an
effect
of
devilish
malice
in
the
master
that
he
addressed
mr
henry
alone
upon
the
matter
of
his
demands
,
and
there
was
never
a
word
to
my
lord
.
the
family
had
looked
on
,
wondering
at
our
economies
.
they
had
lamented
,
i
have
no
doubt
,
that
my
patron
had
become
so
great
a
miser
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
fault
always
despicable
,
but
in
the
young
abhorrent
,
and
mr
henry
was
not
yet
thirty
years
of
age
.
still
,
he
had
managed
the
business
of
durrisdeer
almost
from
a
boy
;
and
they
bore
with
these
changes
in
a
silence
as
proud
and
bitter
as
his
own
,
until
the
coping
-
stone
of
the
edinburgh
visit
.
at
this
time
i
believe
my
patron
and
his
wife
were
rarely
together
,
save
at
meals
.
immediately
on
the
back
of
colonel
burke
'
s
announcement
mrs
henry
made
palpable
advances
;
you
might
say
she
had
laid
a
sort
of
timid
court
to
her
husband
,
different
,
indeed
,
from
her
former
manner
of
unconcern
and
distance
.
i
never
had
the
heart
to
blame
mr
henry
because
he
recoiled
from
these
advances
;
nor
yet
to
censure
the
wife
,
when
she
was
cut
to
the
quick
by
their
rejection
.
but
the
result
was
an
entire
estrangement
,
so
that
(
as
i
say
)
they
rarely
spoke
,
except
at
meals
.
even
the
matter
of
the
edinburgh
visit
was
first
broached
at
table
,
and
it
chanced
that
mrs
henry
was
that
day
ailing
and
querulous
.
she
had
no
sooner
understood
her
husband
'
s
meaning
than
the
red
flew
in
her
face
.
"
at
last
,
"
she
cried
,
"
this
is
too
much
!
heaven
knows
what
pleasure
i
have
in
my
life
,
that
i
should
be
denied
my
only
consolation
.
these
shameful
proclivities
must
be
trod
down
;
we
are
already
a
mark
and
an
eyesore
in
the
neighbourhood
.
i
will
not
endure
this
fresh
insanity
.
"
"
i
cannot
afford
it
,
"
says
mr
henry
.
"

she
cried
.
"

shame

"
he
snarled
,
and
instantly
left
the
room
.
my
old
lord
threw
up
his
hands
to
heaven
,
and
he
and
his
daughter
,
withdrawing
to
the
chimney
,
gave
me
a
broad
hint
to
be
gone
.
i
found
mr
henry
in
his
usual
retreat
,
the
steward
'
s
room
,
perched
on
the
end
of
the
table
,
and
plunging
his
penknife
in
it
with
a
very
ugly
countenance
.
"
mr
.
henry
,
"
said
i
,
"
you
do
yourself
too
much
injustice
,

is
time

should
cease

"

cries
he
,

proclivities

a
niggardly

he
drove
his
knife
up
to
the
hilt
.
"

he
cried
with
an
oath
,
"

will
show

the
more
generous
.
"
"

i
;
"
this
is
only
pride

"
"

he
asked
.
i
thought
he
wanted
help
,
and
i
should
give
it
him
,
willy

nilly

and
no
sooner
was
mrs
henry
gone
to
her
room
than
i
presented
myself
at
her
door
and
sought
admittance
.
she
openly
showed
her
wonder
.
"
what
do
you
want
with
me
,
mr

said
she
.
"

says
i
,

this
thing
lies
too
hard
upon
my
conscience
,

it
will
out

it
possible
that
two
people
can
be
so
blind
as
you

thousand

she
repeated

unobservant
wife

(
looking
upon
me
with
a
strange
smile
)
,
"
but
i
shall
put
this
right
at
once
.
the
master
was
always
of
a
very
thoughtless
nature
;

his
heart
is
excellent
;
he
is
the
soul
of
generosity

i
shall
write
to
him

cannot
think

you
have
pained
me

this
communication

"

i
raged

still
thinking
of
the
master

"
and
pleased
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
pleased
me
of
course
.
"
that
same
day
(
i
will
not
say
but
what
i
watched
)
i
had
the
satisfaction
to
see
mr
henry
come
from
his
wife
'
s
room
in
a
state
most
unlike
himself
;
for
his
face
was
all
bloated
with
weeping
,
and
yet
he
seemed
to
me
to
walk
upon
the
air
.
by
this
,
i
was
sure
his
wife
had
made
him
full
amends
for
once
.
"
ah
,
"
thought
i
to
myself
,
"
i
have
done
a
brave
stroke
this
day
.
"
on
the
morrow
,
as
i
was
seated
at
my
books
,
mr
henry
came
in
softly
behind
me
,
took
me
by
the
shoulders
,
and
shook
me
in
a
manner
of
playfulness
.
"
i
find
you
are
a
faithless
fellow
after
all
,
"
says
he
,
which
was
his
only
reference
to
my
part
;
but
the
tone
he
spoke
in
was
more
to
me
than
any
eloquence
of
protestation
.
nor
was
this
all
i
had
effected
;
for
when
the
next
messenger
came
(
as
he
did
not
long
afterwards
)
from
the
master
,
he
got
nothing
away
with
him
but
a
letter
.
for
some
while
back
it
had
been
i
myself
who
had
conducted
these
affairs
;
mr
henry
not
setting
pen
to
paper
,
and
i
only
in
the
dryest
and
most
formal
terms
.
but
this
letter
i
did
not
even
see
;
it
would
scarce
be
pleasant
reading
,
for
mr
henry
felt
he
had
his
wife
behind
him
for
once
,
and
i
observed
,
on
the
day
it
was
despatched
,
he
had
a
very
gratified
expression
.
things
went
better
now
in
the
family
,
though
it
could
scarce
be
pretended
they
went
well
.
there
was
now
at
least
no
misconception
;
there
was
kindness
upon
all
sides
;
and
i
believe
my
patron
and
his
wife
might
again
have
drawn
together
if
he
could
but
have
pocketed
his
pride
,
and
she
forgot
(
what
was
the
ground
of
all
)
her
brooding
on
another
man
.
it
is
wonderful
how
a
private
thought
leaks
out
;
it
is
wonderful
to
me
now
how
we
should
all
have
followed
the
current
of
her
sentiments
;
and
though
she
bore
herself
quietly
,
and
had
a
very
even
disposition
,
yet
we
should
have
known
whenever
her
fancy
ran
to
paris
.
and
would
not
any
one
have
thought
that
my
disclosure
must
have
rooted
up
that
idol
?
i
think
there
is
the
devil
in
women
:
all
these
years
passed
,
never
a
sight
of
the
man
,
little
enough
kindness
to
remember
(
by
all
accounts
)
even
while
she
had
him
,
the
notion
of
his
death
intervening
,
his
heartless
rapacity
laid
bare
to
her
;
that
all
should
not
do
,
and
she
must
still
keep
the
best
place
in
her
heart
for
this
accursed
fellow
,
is
a
thing
to
make
a
plain
man
rage
.
i
had
never
much
natural
sympathy
for
the
passion
of
love
;
but
this
unreason
in
my
patron
'
s
wife
disgusted
me
outright
with
the
whole
matter
.
i
remember
checking
a
maid
because
she
sang
some
bairnly
kickshaw
while
my
mind
was
thus
engaged
;
and
my
asperity
brought
about
my
ears
the
enmity
of
all
the
petticoats
about
the
house
;
of
which
i
reeked
very
little
,
but
it
amused
mr
henry
,
who
rallied
me
much
upon
our
joint
unpopularity
.
it
is
strange
enough
(
for
my
own
mother
was
certainly
one
of
the
salt
of
the
earth
,
and
my
aunt
dickson
,
who
paid
my
fees
at
the
university
,
a
very
notable
woman
)
,
but
i
have
never
had
much
toleration
for
the
female
sex
,
possibly
not
much
understanding
;
and
being
far
from
a
bold
man
,
i
have
ever
shunned
their
company
.
not
only
do
i
see
no
cause
to
regret
this
diffidence
in
myself
,
but
have
invariably
remarked
the
most
unhappy
consequences
follow
those
who
were
less
wise
.
so
much
i
thought
proper
to
set
down
,
lest
i
show
myself
unjust
to
mrs
henry
.
and
,
besides
,
the
remark
arose
naturally
,
on
a
re
-
perusal
of
the
letter
which
was
the
next
step
in
these
affairs
,
and
reached
me
,
to
my
sincere
astonishment
,
by
a
private
hand
,
some
week
or
so
after
the
departure
of
the
last
messenger
.

from

my
dear
sir

.

.
.
.
you
will
doubtless
be
surprised
to
receive
a
communication
from
one
so
little
known
to
you
;
but
on
the
occasion
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
rencounter
you
at
durrisdeer

i
remarked
you
for
a
young
man
of
a
solid
gravity
of
character
:
a
qualification
which
i
profess
i
admire
and
revere
next
to
natural
genius
or
the
bold
chivalrous
spirit
of
the
soldier
.
i
was
,
besides
,
interested
in
the
noble
family
which
you
have
the
honour
to
serve
,
or
(
to
speak
more
by
the
book
)
to
be
the
humble
and
respected
friend
of
;
and
a
conversation
i
had
the
pleasure
to
have
with
you
very
early
in
the
morning
has
remained
much
upon
my
mind
.
being
the
other
day
in
paris
,
on
a
visit
from
this
famous
city
,
where
i
am
in
garrison
,
i
took
occasion
to
inquire
your
name
(
which
i
profess
i
had
forgot
)
at
my
friend
,
the
master
of
b
.
;
and
a
fair
opportunity
occurring
,
i
write
to
inform
you
of
what
'
s
new
.
the
master
of
b
.
(
when
we
had
last
some
talk
of
him
together
)
was
in
receipt
,
as
i
think
i
then
told
you
,
of
a
highly
advantageous
pension
on
the
scots
fund
.
he
next
received
a
company
,
and
was
soon
after
advanced
to
a
regiment
of
his
own
.
my
dear
sir
,
i
do
not
offer
to
explain
this
circumstance
;
any
more
than
why
i
myself
,
who
have
rid
at
the
right
hand
of
princes
,
should
be
fubbed
off
with
a
pair
of
colours
and
sent
to
rot
in
a
hole
at
the
bottom
of
the
province
.
accustomed
as
i
am
to
courts
,
i
cannot
but
feel
it
is
no
atmosphere
for
a
plain
soldier
;
and
i
could
never
hope
to
advance
by
similar
means
,
even
could
i
stoop
to
the
endeavour
.
but
our
friend
has
a
particular
aptitude
to
succeed
by
the
means
of
ladies
;
and
if
all
be
true
that
i
have
heard
,
he
enjoyed
a
remarkable
protection
.
it
is
like
this
turned
against
him
;
for
when
i
had
the
honour
to
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
he
was
but
newly
released
from
the
bastille
,
where
he
had
been
cast
on
a
sealed
letter
;
and
,
though
now
released
,
has
both
lost
his
regiment
and
his
pension
.
my
dear
sir
,
the
loyalty
of
a
plain
irishman
will
ultimately
succeed
in
the
place
of
craft
;
as
i
am
sure
a
gentleman
of
your
probity
will
agree
.
now
,
sir
,
the
master
is
a
man
whose
genius
i
admire
beyond
expression
,
and
,
besides
,
he
is
my
friend
;
but
i
thought
a
little
word
of
this
revolution
in
his
fortunes
would
not
come
amiss
,
for
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
man
'
s
desperate
.
he
spoke
,
when
i
saw
him
,
of
a
trip
to
india
(
whither
i
am
myself
in
some
hope
of
accompanying
my
illustrious
countryman
,
mr
lally
)
;
but
for
this
he
would
require
(
as
i
understood
)
more
money
than
was
readily
at
his
command
.
you
may
have
heard
a
military
proverb
:
that
it
is
a
good
thing
to
make
a
bridge
of
gold
to
a
flying
enemy
?
i
trust
you
will
take
my
meaning
and
i
subscribe
myself
,
with
proper
respects
to
my
lord
durrisdeer
,
to
his
son
,
and
to
the
beauteous
mrs
durie
,
my
dear
sir
,
your
obedient
humble
servant
,
francis
burke
.
this
missive
i
carried
at
once
to
mr
henry
;
and
i
think
there
was
but
the
one
thought
between
the
two
of
us
:
that
it
had
come
a
week
too
late
.
i
made
haste
to
send
an
answer
to
colonel
burke
,
in
which
i
begged
him
,
if
he
should
see
the
master
,
to
assure
him
his
next
messenger
would
be
attended
to
.
but
with
all
my
haste
i
was
not
in
time
to
avert
what
was
impending
;
the
arrow
had
been
drawn
,
it
must
now
fly
.
i
could
almost
doubt
the
power
of
providence
(
and
certainly
his
will
)
to
stay
the
issue
of
events
;
and
it
is
a
strange
thought
,
how
many
of
us
had
been
storing
up
the
elements
of
this
catastrophe
,
for
how
long
a
time
,
and
with
how
blind
an
ignorance
of
what
we
did
.
from
the
coming
of
the
colonel
'
s
letter
,
i
had
a
spyglass
in
my
room
,
began
to
drop
questions
to
the
tenant
folk
,
and
as
there
was
no
great
secrecy
observed
,
and
the
freetrade
(
in
our
part
)
went
by
force
as
much
as
stealth
,
i
had
soon
got
together
a
knowledge
of
the
signals
in
use
,
and
knew
pretty
well
to
an
hour
when
any
messenger
might
be
expected
.
i
say
,
i
questioned
the
tenants
;
for
with
the
traders
themselves
,
desperate
blades
that
went
habitually
armed
,
i
could
never
bring
myself
to
meddle
willingly
.
indeed
,
by
what
proved
in
the
sequel
an
unhappy
chance
,
i
was
an
object
of
scorn
to
some
of
these
braggadocios
;
who
had
not
only
gratified
me
with
a
nickname
,
but
catching
me
one
night
upon
a
by
-
path
,
and
being
all
(
as
they
would
have
said
)
somewhat
merry
,
had
caused
me
to
dance
for
their
diversion
.
the
method
employed
was
that
of
cruelly
chipping
at
my
toes
with
naked
cutlasses
,
shouting
at
the
same
time
"
square
-
toes
"
;
and
though
they
did
me
no
bodily
mischief
,
i
was
none
the
less
deplorably
affected
,
and
was
indeed
for
several
days
confined
to
my
bed
:
a
scandal
on
the
state
of
scotland
on
which
no
comment
is
required
.
it
happened
on
the
afternoon
of
november
7th
,
in
this
same
unfortunate
year
,
that
i
espied
,
during
my
walk
,
the
smoke
of
a
beacon
fire
upon
the
muckleross
.
it
was
drawing
near
time
for
my
return
;
but
the
uneasiness
upon
my
spirits
was
that
day
so
great
that
i
must
burst
through
the
thickets
to
the
edge
of
what
they
call
the
craig
head
.
the
sun
was
already
down
,
but
there
was
still
a
broad
light
in
the
west
,
which
showed
me
some
of
the
smugglers
treading
out
their
signal
fire
upon
the
ross
,
and
in
the
bay
the
lugger
lying
with
her
sails
brailed
up
.
she
was
plainly
but
new
come
to
anchor
,
and
yet
the
skiff
was
already
lowered
and
pulling
for
the
landing
-
place
at
the
end
of
the
long
shrubbery
.
and
this
i
knew
could
signify
but
one
thing
,
the
coming
of
a
messenger
for
durrisdeer
.
i
laid
aside
the
remainder
of
my
terrors
,
clambered
down
the
brae
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
place
i
had
never
ventured
through
before
,
and
was
hid
among
the
shore
-
side
thickets
in
time
to
see
the
boat
touch
.
captain
crail
himself
was
steering
,
a
thing
not
usual
;
by
his
side
there
sat
a
passenger
;
and
the
men
gave
way
with
difficulty
,
being
hampered
with
near
upon
half
a
dozen
portmanteaus
,
great
and
small
.
but
the
business
of
landing
was
briskly
carried
through
;
and
presently
the
baggage
was
all
tumbled
on
shore
,
the
boat
on
its
return
voyage
to
the
lugger
,
and
the
passenger
standing
alone
upon
the
point
of
rock
,
a
tall
slender
figure
of
a
gentleman
,
habited
in
black
,
with
a
sword
by
his
side
and
a
walking
-
cane
upon
his
wrist
.
as
he
so
stood
,
he
waved
the
cane
to
captain
crail
by
way
of
salutation
,
with
something
both
of
grace
and
mockery
that
wrote
the
gesture
deeply
on
my
mind
.
no
sooner
was
the
boat
away
with
my
sworn
enemies
than
i
took
a
sort
of
half
courage
,
came
forth
to
the
margin
of
the
thicket
,
and
there
halted
again
,
my
mind
being
greatly
pulled
about
between
natural
diffidence
and
a
dark
foreboding
of
the
truth
.
indeed
,
i
might
have
stood
there
swithering
all
night
,
had
not
the
stranger
turned
,
spied
me
through
the
mists
,
which
were
beginning
to
fall
,
and
waved
and
cried
on
me
to
draw
near
.
i
did
so
with
a
heart
like
lead
.
"
here
,
my
good
man
,
"
said
he
,
in
the
english
accent
,
"
there
are
some
things
for
durrisdeer
.
"
i
was
now
near
enough
to
see
him
,
a
very
handsome
figure
and
countenance
,
swarthy
,
lean
,
long
,
with
a
quick
,
alert
,
black
look
,
as
of
one
who
was
a
fighter
,
and
accustomed
to
command
;
upon
one
cheek
he
had
a
mole
,
not
unbecoming
;
a
large
diamond
sparkled
on
his
hand
;
his
clothes
,
although
of
the
one
hue
,
were
of
a
french
and
foppish
design
;
his
ruffles
,
which
he
wore
longer
than
common
,
of
exquisite
lace
;
and
i
wondered
the
more
to
see
him
in
such
a
guise
when
he
was
but
newly
landed
from
a
dirty
smuggling
lugger
.
at
the
same
time
he
had
a
better
look
at
me
,
toised
me
a
second
time
sharply
,
and
then
smiled
.
"
i
wager
,
my
friend
,
"
says
he
,
"
that
i
know
both
your
name
and
your
nickname
.
i
divined
these
very
clothes
upon
your
hand
of
writing
,
mr
mackellar
.
"
at
these
words
i
fell
to
shaking
.
"
oh
,
"
'
says
he
,
"
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
me
.
i
bear
no
malice
for
your
tedious
letters
;
and
it
is
my
purpose
to
employ
you
a
good
deal
.
you
may
call
me
mr
bally
:
it
is
the
name
i
have
assumed
;
or
rather
(
since
i
am
addressing
so
great
a
precision
)
it
is
so
i
have
curtailed
my
own
.
come
now
,
pick
up
that
and
that
"
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
indicating
two
of
the
portmanteaus
.
"
that
will
be
as
much
as
you
are
fit
to
bear
,
and
the
rest
can
very
well
wait
.
come
,
lose
no
more
time
,
if
you
please
.
"
his
tone
was
so
cutting
that
i
managed
to
do
as
he
bid
by
a
sort
of
instinct
,
my
mind
being
all
the
time
quite
lost
.
no
sooner
had
i
picked
up
the
portmanteaus
than
he
turned
his
back
and
marched
off
through
the
long
shrubbery
,
where
it
began
already
to
be
dusk
,
for
the
wood
is
thick
and
evergreen
.
i
followed
behind
,
loaded
almost
to
the
dust
,
though
i
profess
i
was
not
conscious
of
the
burthen
;
being
swallowed
up
in
the
monstrosity
of
this
return
,
and
my
mind
flying
like
a
weaver
'
s
shuttle
.
on
a
sudden
i
set
the
portmanteaus
to
the
ground
and
halted
.
he
turned
and
looked
back
at
me
.
"
well
?
"
said
he
.
"
you
are
the
master
of
ballantrae
?
"
"
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
observe
,
"
says
he
,
"
i
have
made
no
secret
with
the
astute
mackellar
.
"
"

in
the
name

god

cries
i

you
here

go
back

while
it
is
yet
time

"
i
thank
you
,

said
he
.
"
your
master
has
chosen
this
way
,

i
;
but
since
he
has
made
the
choice
,
he
(
and
you
also
)
must
abide
by
the
result
.
and
now
pick
up
these
things
of
mine
,

you
have
set
down
in
a
very
boggy
place

had
no

came
straight
up

him

"
and
i
turned
and
took
to
my
heels
for
durrisdeer
.
he
clutched
at
me
and
cried
out
angrily
,
and
then
i
believe
i
heard
him
laugh
,
and
then
i
am
certain
he
pursued
me
for
a
step
or
two
,
and
(
i
suppose
)
desisted
.
one
thing
at
least
is
sure
,
that
i
came
but
a
few
minutes
later
to
the
door
of
the
great
house
,
nearly
strangled
for
the
lack
of
breath
,
but
quite
alone
.
straight
up
the
stair
i
ran
,
and
burst
into
the
hall
,
and
stopped
before
the
family
without
the
power
of
speech
;
but
i
must
have
carried
my
story
in
my
looks
,
for
they
rose
out
of
their
places
and
stared
on
me
like
changelings
.
"
he
has
come

"
i
panted
out
at

he
not

"
never
a

mrs
henry
;

did
i
look
at
her
,
i
scarce
knew
why

mr

deep

said
i
.
"

me

"
said
he
.
so
we
went
out
together
,
he
and
i
,
without
another
word
from
any
one
;
and
in
the
midst
of
the
gravelled
plot
encountered
the
master
strolling
up
,
whistling
as
he
came
,
and
beating
the
air
with
his
cane
.
there
was
still
light
enough
overhead
to
recognise
,
though
not
to
read
,
a
countenance
.
"
ah
!
jacob

says
the
master
.
"
so
here

esau
back

"
"
james

"
says
mr
henry
,
"

i
will
not
pretend
that
i
am
glad
to
see
you
;
but
i
would
fain
make
you
as
welcome
as
i
can
in
the
house
of
our
fathers
.
"
"
or

my
house

"
says
the
master
.
"
which
were
you
about
to
say

but
this
is
an
old
sore
,

we
need
not
rub
it
.
if
you
would
not
share
with
me
in
paris
,
i
hope
you
will
yet
scarce
deny
your
elder
brother
a
corner
of
the
fire
at
durrisdeer
?
"
"
that
is
very
idle
speech
,
"
replied
mr
henry
.
"
and
you
understand
the
power
of
your
position
excellently
well
.
"
"
why
,
i
believe
i
do
,
"
said
the
other
with
a
little
laugh
.
and
this
,
though
they
had
never
touched
hands
,
was
(
as
we
may
say
)
the
end
of
the
brothers
'
meeting
;
for
at
this
the
master
turned
to
me
and
bade
me
fetch
his
baggage
.
i
,
on
my
side
,
turned
to
mr
henry
for
a
confirmation
;
perhaps
with
some
defiance
.
"
as
long
as
the
master
is
here
,
mr
mackellar
,
you
will
very
much
oblige
me
by
regarding
his
wishes
as
you
would
my
own
,
"
says
mr
henry
.
"
we
are
constantly
troubling
you
:

you
be
so
good
as

one
of
the
servants
?
"
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
with
an
accent
on
the
word
.
if
this
speech
were
anything
at
all
,
it
was
surely
a
well
-
deserved
reproof
upon
the
stranger
;
and
yet
,
so
devilish
was
his
impudence
,
he
twisted
it
the
other
way
.
"
and
shall
we
be
common
enough
to
say
'
sneck
up
'
?
"
inquires
he
softly
,
looking
upon
me
sideways
.
had
a
kingdom
depended
on
the
act
,
i
could
not
have
trusted
myself
in
words
;
even
to
call
a
servant
was
beyond
me
;
i
had
rather
serve
the
man
myself
than
speak
;
and
i
turned
away
in
silence
and
went
into
the
long
shrubbery
,
with
a
heart
full
of
anger
and
despair
.
it
was
dark
under
the
trees
,
and
i
walked
before
me
and
forgot
what
business
i
was
come
upon
,
till
i
near
broke
my
shin
on
the
portmanteaus
.
then
it
was
that
i
remarked
a
strange
particular
;
for
whereas
i
had
before
carried
both
and
scarce
observed
it
,
it
was
now
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
manage
one
.
and
this
,
as
it
forced
me
to
make
two
journeys
,
kept
me
the
longer
from
the
hall
.
when
i
got
there
,
the
business
of
welcome
was
over
long
ago
;
the
company
was
already
at
supper
;
and
by
an
oversight
that
cut
me
to
the
quick
,
my
place
had
been
forgotten
.
i
had
seen
one
side
of
the
master
'
s
return
;
now
i
was
to
see
the
other
.
it
was
he
who
first
remarked
my
coming
in
and
standing
back
(
as
i
did
)
in
some
annoyance
.
he
jumped
from
his
seat
.
"
and
if
i
have
not
got
the
good
mackellar
'
s
place
!
"
cries
he
.
"
john
,
lay
another
for
mr
bally
;
i
protest
he
will
disturb
no
one
,
and
your
table
is
big
enough
for
all
.
"
i
could
scarce
credit
my
ears
,
nor
yet
my
senses
,
when
he
took
me
by
the
shoulders
and
thrust
me
,
laughing
,
into
my
own
place
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
such
an
affectionate
playfulness
was
in
his
voice
.
and
while
john
laid
the
fresh
place
for
him
(
a
thing
on
which
he
still
insisted
)
,
he
went
and
leaned
on
his
father
'
s
chair
and
looked
down
upon
him
,
and
the
old
man
turned
about
and
looked
upwards
on
his
son
,
with
such
a
pleasant
mutual
tenderness
that
i
could
have
carried
my
hand
to
my
head
in
mere
amazement
.
yet
all
was
of
a
piece
.
never
a
harsh
word
fell
from
him
,
never
a
sneer
showed
upon
his
lip
.
he
had
laid
aside
even
his
cutting
english
accent
,
and
spoke
with
the
kindly
scots
'
tongue
,
that
set
a
value
on
affectionate
words
;
and
though
his
manners
had
a
graceful
elegance
mighty
foreign
to
our
ways
in
durrisdeer
,
it
was
still
a
homely
courtliness
,
that
did
not
shame
but
flattered
us
.
all
that
,
he
did
throughout
the
meal
,
indeed
,
drinking
wine
with
me
with
a
notable
respect
,
turning
about
for
a
pleasant
word
with
john
,
fondling
his
father
'
s
hand
,
breaking
into
little
merry
tales
of
his
adventures
,
calling
up
the
past
with
happy
reference
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
all
he
did
was
so
becoming
,
and
himself
so
handsome
,
that
i
could
scarce
wonder
if
my
lord
and
mrs
henry
sat
about
the
board
with
radiant
faces
,
or
if
john
waited
behind
with
dropping
tears
.
as
soon
as
supper
was
over
,
mrs
henry
rose
to
withdraw
.
"
this
was
never
your
way
,
alison
,
"
said
he
.
"
it
is
my
way
now
,
"
she
replied
:
which
was
notoriously
false
,
"
and
i
will
give
you
a
good
-
night
,
james
,
and
a
welcome
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
from
the
dead
,
"
said
she
,
and
her
voice
dropped
and
trembled
.
poor
mr
henry
,
who
had
made
rather
a
heavy
figure
through
the
meal
,
was
more
concerned
than
ever
;
pleased
to
see
his
wife
withdraw
,
and
yet
half
displeased
,
as
he
thought
upon
the
cause
of
it
;
and
the
next
moment
altogether
dashed
by
the
fervour
of
her
speech
.
on
my
part
,
i
thought
i
was
now
one
too
many
;
and
was
stealing
after
mrs
henry
,
when
the
master
saw
me
.
"
now
,
mr
mackellar
,
"
says
he
,
"
i
take
this
near
on
an
unfriendliness

i
cannot
have
you
go

is
to
make
a
stranger

prodigal
son

me

says
my
lord
,
"
we
must
not

stranger
either
of
him
or
you

my
son

he
added
,
his
voice
brightening
as
usual
on
the
word
,
"
how
much
we
valued
all
your
friendly
service
.
"
so
i
sat
there
,
silent
,
till
my
usual
hour
;
and
might
have
been
almost
deceived
in
the
man
'
s
nature
but
for
one
passage
,
in
which
his
perfidy
appeared
too
plain
.
here
was
the
passage
;
of
which
,
after
what
he
knows
of
the
brothers
'
meeting
,
the
reader
shall
consider
for
himself
.
mr
henry
sitting
somewhat
dully
,
in
spite
of
his
best
endeavours
to
carry
things
before
my
lord
,
up
jumps
the
master
,
passes
about
the
board
,
and
claps
his
brother
on
the
shoulder
.
"
come
,
come
,
hairry
lad
,
"
says
he
,
with
a
broad
accent
such
as
they
must
have
used
together
when
they
were
boys
,
"
you
must
not
be
downcast
because
your
brother
has
come
home
.
all
'
s
yours
,
that
'
s
sure
enough
,
and
little
i
grudge
it
you
.
neither
must
you
grudge
me
my
place
beside
my
father
'
s
fire
.
"
"
and
that
is
too
true
,
henry
,
"
says
my
old
lord
with
a
little
frown
,
a
thing
rare
with
him
.
"
you
have
been
the
elder
brother
of
the
parable
in
the
good
sense
;
you
must
be
careful
of
the
other
.
"
"
i
am
easily
put
in
the
wrong
,
"
said
mr
henry
.
"
who
puts
you
in
the
wrong
?
"
cried
my
lord
,
i
thought
very
tartly
for
so
mild
a
man
.
"
you
have
earned
my
gratitude
and
your
brother
'
s
many
thousand
times
:
you
may
count
on
its
endurance
;
and
let
that
suffice
.
"
"
ay
,
harry
,
that
you
may
,
"
said
the
master
;
and
i
thought
mr
henry
looked
at
him
with
a
kind
of
wildness
in
his
eye
.
on
all
the
miserable
business
that
now
followed
,
i
have
four
questions
that
i
asked
myself
often
at
the
time
and
ask
myself
still
:
-
was
the
man
moved
by
a
particular
sentiment
against
mr
henry
?
or
by
what
he
thought
to
be
his
interest
?
or
by
a
mere
delight
in
cruelty
such
as
cats
display
and
theologians
tell
us
of
the
devil
?
or
by
what
he
would
have
called
love
?
my
common
opinion
halts
among
the
three
first
;
but
perhaps
there
lay
at
the
spring
of
his
behaviour
an
element
of
all
.
as
thus
:
-
animosity
to
mr
henry
would
explain
his
hateful
usage
of
him
when
they
were
alone
;
the
interests
he
came
to
serve
would
explain
his
very
different
attitude
before
my
lord
;
that
and
some
spice
of
a
design
of
gallantry
,
his
care
to
stand
well
with
mrs
henry
;
and
the
pleasure
of
malice
for
itself
,
the
pains
he
was
continually
at
to
mingle
and
oppose
these
lines
of
conduct
.
partly
because
i
was
a
very
open
friend
to
my
patron
,
partly
because
in
my
letters
to
paris
i
had
often
given
myself
some
freedom
of
remonstrance
,
i
was
included
in
his
diabolical
amusement
.
when
i
was
alone
with
him
,
he
pursued
me
with
sneers
;
before
the
family
he
used
me
with
the
extreme
of
friendly
condescension
.
this
was
not
only
painful
in
itself
;
not
only
did
it
put
me
continually
in
the
wrong
;
but
there
was
in
it
an
element
of
insult
indescribable
.
that
he
should
thus
leave
me
out
in
his
dissimulation
,
as
though
even
my
testimony
were
too
despicable
to
be
considered
,
galled
me
to
the
blood
.
but
what
it
was
to
me
is
not
worth
notice
.
i
make
but
memorandum
of
it
here
;
and
chiefly
for
this
reason
,
that
it
had
one
good
result
,
and
gave
me
the
quicker
sense
of
mr
henry
'
s
martyrdom
.
it
was
on
him
the
burthen
fell
.
how
was
he
to
respond
to
the
public
advances
of
one
who
never
lost
a
chance
of
gibing
him
in
private
?
how
was
he
to
smile
back
on
the
deceiver
and
the
insulter
?
he
was
condemned
to
seem
ungracious
.
he
was
condemned
to
silence
.
had
he
been
less
proud
,
had
he
spoken
,
who
would
have
credited
the
truth
?
the
acted
calumny
had
done
its
work
;
my
lord
and
mrs
henry
were
the
daily
witnesses
of
what
went
on
;
they
could
have
sworn
in
court
that
the
master
was
a
model
of
long
-
suffering
good
-
nature
,
and
mr
henry
a
pattern
of
jealousy
and
thanklessness
.
and
ugly
enough
as
these
must
have
appeared
in
any
one
,
they
seemed
tenfold
uglier
in
mr
henry
;
for
who
could
forget
that
the
master
lay
in
peril
of
his
life
,
and
that
he
had
already
lost
his
mistress
,
his
title
,
and
his
fortune
?
"
henry
,
will
you
ride
with
me
?
"
asks
the
master
one
day
.
and
mr
henry
,
who
had
been
goaded
by
the
man
all
morning
,
raps
out
:
"
i
will
not
.
"
"
i
sometimes
wish
you
would
be
kinder
,
henry
,
"
says
the
other
,
wistfully
.
i
give
this
for
a
specimen
;
but
such
scenes
befell
continually
.
small
wonder
if
mr
henry
was
blamed
;
small
wonder
if
i
fretted
myself
into
something
near
upon
a
bilious
fever
;
nay
,
and
at
the
mere
recollection
feel
a
bitterness
in
my
blood
.
sure
,
never
in
this
world
was
a
more
diabolical
contrivance
:
so
perfidious
,
so
simple
,
so
impossible
to
combat
.
and
yet
i
think
again
,
and
i
think
always
,
mrs
henry
might
have
road
between
the
lines
;
she
might
have
had
more
knowledge
of
her
husband
'
s
nature
;
after
all
these
years
of
marriage
she
might
have
commanded
or
captured
his
confidence
.
and
my
old
lord
,
too
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
very
watchful
gentleman
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
where
was
all
his
observation
?
but
,
for
one
thing
,
the
deceit
was
practised
by
a
master
hand
,
and
might
have
gulled
an
angel
.
for
another
(
in
the
case
of
mrs
henry
)
,
i
have
observed
there
are
no
persons
so
far
away
as
those
who
are
both
married
and
estranged
,
so
that
they
seem
out
of
ear
-
shot
or
to
have
no
common
tongue
.
for
a
third
(
in
the
case
of
both
of
these
spectators
)
,
they
were
blinded
by
old
ingrained
predilection
.
and
for
a
fourth
,
the
risk
the
master
was
supposed
to
stand
in
(
supposed
,
i
say
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
will
soon
hear
why
)
made
it
seem
the
more
ungenerous
to
criticise
;
and
,
keeping
them
in
a
perpetual
tender
solicitude
about
his
life
,
blinded
them
the
more
effectually
to
his
faults
.
it
was
during
this
time
that
i
perceived
most
clearly
the
effect
of
manner
,
and
was
led
to
lament
most
deeply
the
plainness
of
my
own
.
mr
henry
had
the
essence
of
a
gentleman
;
when
he
was
moved
,
when
there
was
any
call
of
circumstance
,
he
could
play
his
part
with
dignity
and
spirit
;
but
in
the
day
'
s
commerce
(
it
is
idle
to
deny
it
)
he
fell
short
of
the
ornamental
.
the
master
(
on
the
other
hand
)
had
never
a
movement
but
it
commanded
him
.
so
it
befell
that
when
the
one
appeared
gracious
and
the
other
ungracious
,
every
trick
of
their
bodies
seemed
to
call
out
confirmation
.
not
that
alone
:
but
the
more
deeply
mr
henry
floundered
in
his
brother
'
s
toils
,
the
more
clownish
he
grew
;
and
the
more
the
master
enjoyed
his
spiteful
entertainment
,
the
more
engagingly
,
the
more
smilingly
,
he
went
!
so
that
the
plot
,
by
its
own
scope
and
progress
,
furthered
and
confirmed
itself
.
it
was
one
of
the
man
'
s
arts
to
use
the
peril
in
which
(
as
i
say
)
he
was
supposed
to
stand
.
he
spoke
of
it
to
those
who
loved
him
with
a
gentle
pleasantry
,
which
made
it
the
more
touching
.
to
mr
henry
he
used
it
as
a
cruel
weapon
of
offence
.
i
remember
his
laying
his
finger
on
the
clean
lozenge
of
the
painted
window
one
day
when
we
three
were
alone
together
in
the
hall
.
"
here
went
your
lucky
guinea
,
jacob
,
"
said
he
.
and
when
mr
henry
only
looked
upon
him
darkly
,
"
oh
!
"
he
added
,
"
you
need
not
look
such
impotent
malice
,
my
good
fly
.
you
can
be
rid
of
your
spider
when
you
please
.
how
long
,
o
lord
?
when
are
you
to
be
wrought
to
the
point
of
a
denunciation
,
scrupulous
brother
?
it
is
one
of
my
interests
in
this
dreary
hole
.
i
ever
loved
experiment
.
"
still
mr
henry
only
stared
upon
him
with
a
grooming
brow
,
and
a
changed
colour
;
and
at
last
the
master
broke
out
in
a
laugh
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
,
calling
him
a
sulky
dog
.
at
this
my
patron
leaped
back
with
a
gesture
i
thought
very
dangerous
;
and
i
must
suppose
the
master
thought
so
too
,
for
he
looked
the
least
in
the
world
discountenance
,
and
i
do
not
remember
him
again
to
have
laid
hands
on
mr
henry
.
but
though
he
had
his
peril
always
on
his
lips
in
the
one
way
or
the
other
,
i
thought
his
conduct
strangely
incautious
,
and
began
to
fancy
the
government
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
who
had
set
a
price
upon
his
head
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
was
gone
sound
asleep
.
i
will
not
deny
i
was
tempted
with
the
wish
to
denounce
him
;
but
two
thoughts
withheld
me
:
one
,
that
if
he
were
thus
to
end
his
life
upon
an
honourable
scaffold
,
the
man
would
be
canonised
for
good
in
the
minds
of
his
father
and
my
patron
'
s
wife
;
the
other
,
that
if
i
was
anyway
mingled
in
the
matter
,
mr
henry
himself
would
scarce
escape
some
glancings
of
suspicion
.
and
in
the
meanwhile
our
enemy
went
in
and
out
more
than
i
could
have
thought
possible
,
the
fact
that
he
was
home
again
was
buzzed
about
all
the
country
-
side
,
and
yet
he
was
never
stirred
.
of
all
these
so
-
many
and
so
-
different
persons
who
were
acquainted
with
his
presence
,
none
had
the
least
greed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
as
i
used
to
say
in
my
annoyance
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
or
the
least
loyalty
;
and
the
man
rode
here
and
there
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
fully
more
welcome
,
considering
the
lees
of
old
unpopularity
,
than
mr
henry
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
considering
the
freetraders
,
far
safer
than
myself
.
not
but
what
he
had
a
trouble
of
his
own
;
and
this
,
as
it
brought
about
the
gravest
consequences
,
i
must
now
relate
.
the
reader
will
scarce
have
forgotten
jessie
broun
;
her
way
of
life
was
much
among
the
smuggling
party
;
captain
crail
himself
was
of
her
intimates
;
and
she
had
early
word
of
mr
bally
'
s
presence
at
the
house
.
in
my
opinion
,
she
had
long
ceased
to
care
two
straws
for
the
master
'
s
person
;
but
it
was
become
her
habit
to
connect
herself
continually
with
the
master
'
s
name
;
that
was
the
ground
of
all
her
play
-
acting
;
and
so
now
,
when
he
was
back
,
she
thought
she
owed
it
to
herself
to
grow
a
haunter
of
the
neighbourhood
of
durrisdeer
.
the
master
could
scarce
go
abroad
but
she
was
there
in
wait
for
him
;
a
scandalous
figure
of
a
woman
,
not
often
sober
;
hailing
him
wildly
as
"
her
bonny
laddie
,
"
quoting
pedlar
'
s
poetry
,
and
,
as
i
receive
the
story
,
even
seeking
to
weep
upon
his
neck
.
i
own
i
rubbed
my
hands
over
this
persecution
;
but
the
master
,
who
laid
so
much
upon
others
,
was
himself
the
least
patient
of
men
.
there
were
strange
scenes
enacted
in
the
policies
.
some
say
he
took
his
cane
to
her
,
and
jessie
fell
back
upon
her
former
weapons
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
stones
.
it
is
certain
at
least
that
he
made
a
motion
to
captain
crail
to
have
the
woman
trepanned
,
and
that
the
captain
refused
the
proposition
with
uncommon
vehemence
.
and
the
end
of
the
matter
was
victory
for
jessie
.
money
was
got
together
;
an
interview
took
place
,
in
which
my
proud
gentleman
must
consent
to
be
kissed
and
wept
upon
;
and
the
woman
was
set
up
in
a
public
of
her
own
,
somewhere
on
solway
side
(
but
i
forget
where
)
,
and
,
by
the
only
news
i
ever
had
of
it
,
extremely
ill
-
frequented
.
this
is
to
look
forward
.
after
jessie
had
been
but
a
little
while
upon
his
heels
,
the
master
comes
to
me
one
day
in
the
steward
'
s
office
,
and
with
more
civility
than
usual
,
"
mackellar
,
"
says
he
,
"
there
is
a
damned
crazy
wench
comes
about
here
.
i
cannot
well
move
in
the
matter
myself
,
which
brings
me
to
you
.
be
so
good
as
to
see
to
it
:
the
men
must
have
a
strict
injunction
to
drive
the
wench
away
.
"
"
sir
,
"
said
i
,
trembling
a
little
,
"
you
can
do
your
own
dirty
errands
for
yourself
.
"
he
said
not
a
word
to
that
,
and
left
the
room
.
presently
came
mr
henry
.
"
here
is
news
!
"
cried
he
.
"
it
seems
all
is
not
enough
,
and
you
must
add
to
my
wretchedness
.
it
seems
you
have
insulted
mr
bally
.
"
"
under
your
kind
favour
,
mr
henry
,
"
said
i
,
"
it
was
he
that
insulted
me
,
and
,
as
i
think
,
grossly
.
but
i
may
have
been
careless
of
your
position
when
i
spoke
;
and
if
you
think
so
when
you
know
all
,
my
dear
patron
,
you
have
but
to
say
the
word
.
for
you
i
would
obey
in
any
point
whatever
,
even
to
sin
,
god
pardon
me
!
"
and
thereupon
i
told
him
what
had
passed
.
mr
henry
smiled
to
himself

a
grimmer
smile
i
never
witnessed

said
he
.
"
he
shall
drink
his
jessie
broun
to
the
dregs
.
"
and
then
,
spying
the
master
outside
,
he
opened
the
window
,
and
crying
to
him
by
the
name
of
mr
bally
,
asked
him
to
step
up
and
have
a
word
.
"

said
he
,
when
our
persecutor
had
come
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
,
looking
at
me
with
a
smile
,
as
if
he
thought
i
was
to
be
humbled
,
"
you
brought
me
a
complaint
against
mr
mackellar
,
into
which
i
have
inquired
.
i
need
not
tell
you
i
would
always
take
his
word
against
yours

for
we
are
alone

i
am
going
to
use
something
of
your
own
freedom

mr
mackellar
is
a
gentleman
i
value
;
and
you
must
contrive
,
so
long
as
you
are
under
this
roof
,
to
bring
yourself
into
no
more
collisions
with
one
whom
i
will
support
at
any
possible
cost
to
me
or
mine
.
as
for
the
errand
upon
which
you
came
to
him
,
you
must
deliver
yourself
from
the
consequences
of
your
own
cruelty
,
and
,
none
of
my
servants
shall
be
at
all
employed
in
such
a
case

"

says
the
master
.
"
go
to
him
with
this
tale
,
"
said
mr
henry
.
the
master
grew
very
white
.
he
pointed
at
me
with
his
finger
.
"
i
want

man
discharged

he
said

mr

"

pretty

the
master
.
"
i
have
paid
so
dear
already

a
wicked
brother

"
said
mr
henry
,
"
that
i
am
bankrupt

of
fears

strike

"
"
i
will
show
you
about

says
the
master
,
and
went
softly
away
.
"
what
will
he
do
next
,
mackellar
?
"
cries
mr
henry
.
"
let
me
go
away
,
"
said
i
.
"
my
dear
patron
,
let
me
go
away
;
i
am
but
the
beginning
of
fresh
sorrows
.
"
"
would
you
leave
me
quite
alone
?
"
said
he
.
we
were
not
long
in
suspense
as
to
the
nature
of
the
new
assault
.
up
to
that
hour
the
master
had
played
a
very
close
game
with
mrs
henry
;
avoiding
pointedly
to
be
alone
with
her
,
which
i
took
at
the
time
for
an
effect
of
decency
,
but
now
think
to
be
a
most
insidious
art
;
meeting
her
,
you
may
say
,
at
meal
-
time
only
;
and
behaving
,
when
he
did
so
,
like
an
affectionate
brother
.
up
to
that
hour
,
you
may
say
he
had
scarce
directly
interfered
between
mr
henry
and
his
wife
;
except
in
so
far
as
he
had
manoeuvred
the
one
quite
forth
from
the
good
graces
of
the
other
.
now
all
that
was
to
be
changed
;
but
whether
really
in
revenge
,
or
because
he
was
wearying
of
durrisdeer
and
looked
about
for
some
diversion
,
who
but
the
devil
shall
decide
?
from
that
hour
,
at
least
,
began
the
siege
of
mrs
henry
;
a
thing
so
deftly
carried
on
that
i
scarce
know
if
she
was
aware
of
it
herself
,
and
that
her
husband
must
look
on
in
silence
.
the
first
parallel
was
opened
(
as
was
made
to
appear
)
by
accident
.
the
talk
fell
,
as
it
did
often
,
on
the
exiles
in
france
;
so
it
glided
to
the
matter
of
their
songs
.
"
there
is
one
,
"
says
the
master
,
"
if
you
are
curious
in
these
matters
,
that
has
always
seemed
to
me
very
moving
.
the
poetry
is
harsh
;
and
yet
,
perhaps
because
of
my
situation
,
it
has
always
found
the
way
to
my
heart
.
it
is
supposed
to
be
sung
,
i
should
tell
you
,
by
an
exile
'
s
sweetheart
;
and
represents
perhaps
,
not
so
much
the
truth
of
what
she
is
thinking
,
as
the
truth
of
what
he
hopes
of
her
,
poor
soul
!
in
these
far
lands
.
"
and
here
the
master
sighed
,
"
i
protest
it
is
a
pathetic
sight
when
a
score
of
rough
irish
,
all
common
sentinels
,
get
to
this
song
;
and
you
may
see
,
by
their
falling
tears
,
how
it
strikes
home
to
them
.
it
goes
thus
,
father
,
"
says
he
,
very
adroitly
taking
my
lord
for
his
listener
,
"
and
if
i
cannot
get
to
the
end
of
it
,
you
must
think
it
is
a
common
case
with
us
exiles
.
"
and
thereupon
he
struck
up
the
same
air
as
i
had
heard
the
colonel
whistle
;
but
now
to
words
,
rustic
indeed
,
yet
most
pathetically
setting
forth
a
poor
girl
'
s
aspirations
for
an
exiled
lover
;
of
which
one
verse
indeed
(
or
something
like
it
)
still
sticks
by
me
:
-
o
,
i
will
dye
my
petticoat
red
,
with
my
dear
boy
i
will
beg
my
bread
,
though
all
my
friends
should
wish
me
dead
,
for
willie
among
the
rushes
,
o
!
he
sang
it
well
,
even
as
a
song
;
but
he
did
better
yet
a
performer
.
i
have
heard
famous
actors
,
when
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
edinburgh
theatre
;
a
great
wonder
to
behold
;
but
no
more
wonderful
than
how
the
master
played
upon
that
little
ballad
,
and
on
those
who
heard
him
,
like
an
instrument
,
and
seemed
now
upon
the
point
of
failing
,
and
now
to
conquer
his
distress
,
so
that
words
and
music
seemed
to
pour
out
of
his
own
heart
and
his
own
past
,
and
to
be
aimed
directly
at
mrs
henry
.
and
his
art
went
further
yet
;
for
all
was
so
delicately
touched
,
it
seemed
impossible
to
suspect
him
of
the
least
design
;
and
so
far
from
making
a
parade
of
emotion
,
you
would
have
sworn
he
was
striving
to
be
calm
.
when
it
came
to
an
end
,
we
all
sat
silent
for
a
time
;
he
had
chosen
the
dusk
of
the
afternoon
,
so
that
none
could
see
his
neighbour
'
s
face
;
but
it
seemed
as
if
we
held
our
breathing
;
only
my
old
lord
cleared
his
throat
.
the
first
to
move
was
the
singer
,
who
got
to
his
feet
suddenly
and
softly
,
and
went
and
walked
softly
to
and
fro
in
the
low
end
of
the
hall
,
mr
henry
'
s
customary
place
.
we
were
to
suppose
that
he
there
struggled
down
the
last
of
his
emotion
;
for
he
presently
returned
and
launched
into
a
disquisition
on
the
nature
of
the
irish
(
always
so
much
miscalled
,
and
whom
he
defended
)
in
his
natural
voice
;
so
that
,
before
the
lights
were
brought
,
we
were
in
the
usual
course
of
talk
.
but
even
then
,
methought
mrs
henry
'
s
face
was
a
shade
pale
;
and
,
for
another
thing
,
she
withdrew
almost
at
once
.
the
next
sign
was
a
friendship
this
insidious
devil
struck
up
with
innocent
miss
katharine
;
so
that
they
were
always
together
,
hand
in
hand
,
or
she
climbing
on
his
knee
,
like
a
pair
of
children
.
like
all
his
diabolical
acts
,
this
cut
in
several
ways
.
it
was
the
last
stroke
to
mr
henry
,
to
see
his
own
babe
debauched
against
him
;
it
made
him
harsh
with
the
poor
innocent
,
which
brought
him
still
a
peg
lower
in
his
wife
'
s
esteem
;
and
(
to
conclude
)
it
was
a
bond
of
union
between
the
lady
and
the
master
.
under
this
influence
,
their
old
reserve
melted
by
daily
stages
.
presently
there
came
walks
in
the
long
shrubbery
,
talks
in
the
belvedere
,
and
i
know
not
what
tender
familiarity
.
i
am
sure
mrs
henry
was
like
many
a
good
woman
;
she
had
a
whole
conscience
but
perhaps
by
the
means
of
a
little
winking
.
for
even
to
so
dull
an
observer
as
myself
,
it
was
plain
her
kindness
was
of
a
more
moving
nature
than
the
sisterly
.
the
tones
of
her
voice
appeared
more
numerous
;
she
had
a
light
and
softness
in
her
eye
;
she
was
more
gentle
with
all
of
us
,
even
with
mr
henry
,
even
with
myself
;
methought
she
breathed
of
some
quiet
melancholy
happiness
.
to
look
on
at
this
,
what
a
torment
it
was
for
mr
henry
!
and
yet
it
brought
our
ultimate
deliverance
,
as
i
am
soon
to
tell
.
the
purport
of
the
master
'
s
stay
was
no
more
noble
(
gild
it
as
they
might
)
than
to
wring
money
out
.
he
had
some
design
of
a
fortune
in
the
french
indies
,
as
the
chevalier
wrote
me
;
and
it
was
the
sum
required
for
this
that
he
came
seeking
.
for
the
rest
of
the
family
it
spelled
ruin
;
but
my
lord
,
in
his
incredible
partiality
,
pushed
ever
for
the
granting
.
the
family
was
now
so
narrowed
down
(
indeed
,
there
were
no
more
of
them
than
just
the
father
and
the
two
sons
)
that
it
was
possible
to
break
the
entail
and
alienate
a
piece
of
land
.
and
to
this
,
at
first
by
hints
,
and
then
by
open
pressure
,
mr
henry
was
brought
to
consent
.
he
never
would
have
done
so
,
i
am
very
well
assured
,
but
for
the
weight
of
the
distress
under
which
he
laboured
.
but
for
his
passionate
eagerness
to
see
his
brother
gone
,
he
would
not
thus
have
broken
with
his
own
sentiment
