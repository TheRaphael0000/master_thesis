they
lived
on
at
the
hotel
some
days
longer
eyed
curiously
by
the
chambermaids
and
burst
in
upon
every
now
and
then
by
the
waiters
as
if
accidentally
when
they
were
walking
together
mostly
in
back
streets
for
fear
of
being
recognized
marcia
was
often
silent
and
her
imperious
face
looked
gloomy
'
dummy
he
said
playfully
on
one
of
these
occasions
'
i
am
vexed
that
by
your
admissions
at
doctors
'
commons
you
prevented
them
giving
you
the
licence
at
once
it
is
not
nice
my
living
on
with
you
like
this
'
but
we
are
going
to
marry
dear
'
yes
she
murmured
and
fell
into
reverie
again
what
a
sudden
resolve
it
was
of
ours
she
continued
i
wish
i
could
get
my
father
and
mother
'
s
consent
to
our
marriage
as
we
ca
not
complete
it
for
another
day
or
two
a
letter
might
be
sent
to
them
and
their
answer
received
i
have
a
mind
to
write
pierston
expressed
his
doubts
of
the
wisdom
of
this
course
which
seemed
to
make
her
desire
it
the
more
and
the
result
was
a
tiff
between
them
since
we
are
obliged
to
delay
it
i
wo
not
marry
without
their
consent
she
cried
at
last
passionately
'
very
well
then
dear
write
he
said
when
they
were
again
indoors
she
sat
down
to
a
note
but
after
a
while
threw
aside
her
pen
despairingly
no
i
cannot
do
it
she
said
i
ca
not
bend
my
pride
to
such
a
job
will
you
write
for
me
jocelyn
'
i
i
do
not
see
why
i
should
be
the
one
particularly
as
i
think
it
premature
'
but
you
have
not
quarrelled
with
my
father
as
i
have
done
'
well
no
but
there
is
a
long
-
standing
antagonism
which
would
make
it
odd
in
me
to
be
the
writer
wait
till
we
are
married
and
then
i
will
write
not
till
then
'
then
i
suppose
i
must
you
do
not
know
my
father
he
might
forgive
me
marrying
into
any
other
family
without
his
knowledge
but
he
thinks
yours
such
a
mean
one
and
so
resents
the
trade
rivalry
that
he
would
never
pardon
till
the
day
of
his
death
my
becoming
a
pierston
secretly
i
did
not
see
it
at
first
this
remark
caused
an
unpleasant
jar
on
the
mind
of
pierston
despite
his
independent
artistic
position
in
london
he
was
staunch
to
the
simple
old
parent
who
had
stubbornly
held
out
for
so
many
years
against
bencomb
'
s
encroaching
trade
and
whose
money
had
educated
and
maintained
jocelyn
as
an
art
-
student
in
the
best
schools
so
he
begged
her
to
say
no
more
about
his
mean
family
and
she
silently
resumed
her
letter
giving
an
address
at
a
post
-
office
that
their
quarters
might
not
be
discovered
at
least
just
yet
no
reply
came
by
return
of
post
but
rather
ominously
some
letters
for
marcia
that
had
arrived
at
her
father
'
s
since
her
departure
were
sent
on
in
silence
to
the
address
given
she
opened
them
one
by
one
till
on
reading
the
last
she
exclaimed
good
gracious
and
burst
into
laughter
'
what
is
it
asked
pierston
marcia
began
to
read
the
letter
aloud
it
came
from
a
faithful
lover
of
hers
a
youthful
jersey
gentleman
who
stated
that
he
was
soon
going
to
start
for
england
to
claim
his
darling
according
to
her
plighted
word
she
was
half
risible
half
concerned
what
shall
i
do
she
said
'
do
my
dear
girl
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
only
one
thing
to
do
and
that
a
very
obvious
thing
tell
him
as
soon
as
possible
that
you
are
just
on
the
point
of
marriage
marcia
thereupon
wrote
out
a
reply
to
that
effect
jocelyn
helping
her
to
shape
the
phrases
as
gently
as
possible
'
i
repeat
'
(
her
letter
concluded
)
'
that
i
had
quite
forgotten
i
am
deeply
sorry
but
that
is
the
truth
i
have
told
my
intended
husband
everything
and
he
is
looking
over
my
shoulder
as
i
write
said
jocelyn
when
he
saw
this
set
down
you
might
leave
out
the
last
few
words
they
are
rather
an
extra
stab
for
the
poor
boy
'
stab
it
is
not
that
dear
why
does
he
want
to
come
bothering
me
jocelyn
you
ought
to
be
very
proud
that
i
have
put
you
in
my
letter
at
all
you
said
yesterday
that
i
was
conceited
in
declaring
i
might
have
married
that
science
-
man
i
told
you
of
but
now
you
see
there
was
yet
another
available
he
gloomily
well
i
do
not
care
to
hear
about
that
to
my
mind
this
sort
of
thing
is
decidedly
unpleasant
though
you
treat
it
so
lightly
'
well
she
pouted
i
have
only
done
half
what
you
have
done
'
what
'
s
that
'
i
have
only
proved
false
through
forgetfulness
but
you
have
while
remembering
'
o
yes
of
course
you
can
use
avice
caro
as
a
retort
but
do
not
vex
me
about
her
and
make
me
do
such
an
unexpected
thing
as
regret
the
falseness
she
shut
her
mouth
tight
and
her
face
flushed
the
next
morning
there
did
come
an
answer
to
the
letter
asking
her
parents
'
consent
to
her
union
with
him
but
to
marcia
'
s
amazement
her
father
took
a
line
quite
other
than
the
one
she
had
expected
him
to
take
whether
she
had
compromised
herself
or
whether
she
had
not
seemed
a
question
for
the
future
rather
than
the
present
with
him
a
native
islander
born
when
old
island
marriage
views
prevailed
in
families
he
was
fixed
in
his
disapproval
of
her
marriage
with
a
hated
pierston
he
did
not
consent
he
would
not
say
more
till
he
could
see
her
if
she
had
any
sense
at
all
she
would
if
still
unmarried
return
to
the
home
from
which
she
had
evidently
been
enticed
he
would
then
see
what
he
could
do
for
her
in
the
desperate
circumstances
she
had
made
for
herself
otherwise
he
would
do
nothing
pierston
could
not
help
being
sarcastic
at
her
father
'
s
evidently
low
estimate
of
him
and
his
belongings
and
marcia
took
umbrage
at
his
sarcasms
'
i
am
the
one
deserving
of
satire
if
anybody
she
said
i
begin
to
feel
i
was
a
foolish
girl
to
run
away
from
a
father
for
such
a
trumpery
reason
as
a
little
scolding
because
i
had
exceeded
my
allowance
'
i
advised
you
to
go
back
marcie
'
in
a
sort
of
way
not
in
the
right
tone
you
spoke
most
contemptuously
of
my
father
'
s
honesty
as
a
merchant
'
i
could
not
speak
otherwise
of
him
than
i
did
i
am
afraid
knowing
what
'
what
have
you
to
say
against
him
'
nothing
to
you
marcie
beyond
what
is
matter
of
common
notoriety
everybody
knows
that
at
one
time
he
made
it
the
business
of
his
life
to
ruin
my
father
and
the
way
he
alludes
to
me
in
that
letter
shows
that
his
enmity
still
continues
'
that
miser
ruined
by
an
open
-
handed
man
like
my
father
said
she
it
is
like
your
people
'
s
misrepresentations
to
say
that
marcia
'
s
eyes
flashed
and
her
face
burnt
with
an
angry
heat
the
enhanced
beauty
which
this
warmth
might
have
brought
being
killed
by
the
rectilinear
sternness
of
countenance
that
came
therewith
'
marcia
this
temper
is
too
exasperating
i
could
give
you
every
step
of
the
proceeding
in
detail
anybody
could
the
getting
the
quarries
one
by
one
and
everything
my
father
only
holding
his
own
by
the
most
desperate
courage
there
is
no
blinking
facts
our
parents
'
relations
are
an
ugly
fact
in
the
circumstances
of
us
two
people
who
want
to
marry
and
we
are
just
beginning
to
perceive
it
and
how
we
are
going
to
get
over
it
i
cannot
tell
she
said
steadily
i
do
not
think
we
shall
get
over
it
at
all
'
we
may
not
we
may
not
altogether
pierston
murmured
as
he
gazed
at
the
fine
picture
of
scorn
presented
by
his
juno
'
s
classical
face
and
dark
eyes
'
unless
you
beg
my
pardon
for
having
behaved
so
pierston
could
not
quite
bring
himself
to
see
that
he
had
behaved
badly
to
his
too
imperious
lady
and
declined
to
ask
forgiveness
for
what
he
had
not
done
she
thereupon
left
the
room
later
in
the
day
she
re
-
entered
and
broke
a
silence
by
saying
bitterly
i
showed
temper
just
now
as
you
told
me
but
things
have
causes
and
it
is
perhaps
a
mistake
that
you
should
have
deserted
avice
for
me
instead
of
wedding
rosaline
romeo
must
needs
go
eloping
with
juliet
it
was
a
fortunate
thing
for
the
affections
of
those
two
veronese
lovers
that
they
died
when
they
did
in
a
short
time
the
enmity
of
their
families
would
have
proved
a
fruitful
source
of
dissension
juliet
would
have
gone
back
to
her
people
he
to
his
the
subject
would
have
split
them
as
much
as
it
splits
us
pierston
laughed
a
little
but
marcia
was
painfully
serious
as
he
found
at
tea
-
time
when
she
said
that
since
his
refusal
to
beg
her
pardon
she
had
been
thinking
over
the
matter
and
had
resolved
to
go
to
her
aunt
'
s
after
all
at
any
rate
till
her
father
could
be
induced
to
agree
to
their
union
pierston
was
as
chilled
by
this
resolve
of
hers
as
he
was
surprised
at
her
independence
in
circumstances
which
usually
make
women
the
reverse
but
he
put
no
obstacles
in
her
way
and
with
a
kiss
strangely
cold
after
their
recent
ardour
the
romeo
of
the
freestone
montagues
went
out
of
the
hotel
to
avoid
even
the
appearance
of
coercing
his
juliet
of
the
rival
house
when
he
returned
she
was
gone
a
correspondence
began
between
these
too
-
hastily
pledged
ones
and
it
was
carried
on
in
terms
of
serious
reasoning
upon
their
awkward
situation
on
account
of
the
family
feud
they
saw
their
recent
love
as
what
it
was
too
rash
too
unadvised
too
sudden
too
like
the
lightning
they
saw
it
with
an
eye
whose
calmness
coldness
and
it
must
be
added
wisdom
did
not
promise
well
for
their
reunion
their
debates
were
clinched
by
a
final
letter
from
marcia
sent
from
no
other
place
than
her
recently
left
home
in
the
isle
she
informed
him
that
her
father
had
appeared
suddenly
at
her
aunt
'
s
and
had
induced
her
to
go
home
with
him
she
had
told
her
father
all
the
circumstances
of
their
elopement
and
what
mere
accidents
had
caused
it
he
had
persuaded
her
on
what
she
had
almost
been
convinced
of
by
their
disagreement
that
all
thought
of
their
marriage
should
be
at
least
postponed
for
the
present
any
awkwardness
and
even
scandal
being
better
than
that
they
should
immediately
unite
themselves
for
life
on
the
strength
of
a
two
or
three
days
'
resultless
passion
and
be
the
wretched
victims
of
a
situation
they
could
never
change
pierston
saw
plainly
enough
that
he
owed
it
to
her
father
being
a
born
islander
with
all
the
ancient
island
notions
of
matrimony
lying
underneath
his
acquired
conventions
that
the
stone
-
merchant
did
not
immediately
insist
upon
the
usual
remedy
for
a
daughter
'
s
precipitancy
in
such
cases
but
preferred
to
await
issues
but
the
young
man
still
thought
that
marcia
herself
when
her
temper
had
quite
cooled
and
she
was
more
conscious
of
her
real
position
would
return
to
him
in
spite
of
the
family
hostility
there
was
no
social
reason
against
such
a
step
in
birth
the
pair
were
about
on
one
plane
and
though
marcia
'
s
family
had
gained
a
start
in
the
accumulation
of
wealth
and
in
the
beginnings
of
social
distinction
which
lent
colour
to
the
feeling
that
the
advantages
of
the
match
would
be
mainly
on
one
side
pierston
was
a
sculptor
who
might
rise
to
fame
so
that
potentially
their
marriage
could
not
be
considered
inauspicious
for
a
woman
who
beyond
being
the
probable
heiress
to
a
considerable
fortune
had
no
exceptional
opportunities
thus
though
disillusioned
he
felt
bound
in
honour
to
remain
on
call
at
his
london
address
as
long
as
there
was
the
slightest
chance
of
marcia
'
s
reappearance
or
of
the
arrival
of
some
message
requesting
him
to
join
her
that
they
might
after
all
go
to
the
altar
together
yet
in
the
night
he
seemed
to
hear
sardonic
voices
and
laughter
in
the
wind
at
this
development
of
his
little
romance
and
during
the
slow
and
colourless
days
he
had
to
sit
and
behold
the
mournful
departure
of
his
well
-
beloved
from
the
form
he
had
lately
cherished
till
she
had
almost
vanished
away
the
exact
moment
of
her
complete
withdrawal
pierston
knew
not
but
not
many
lines
of
her
were
longer
discernible
in
marcia
'
s
remembered
contours
nor
many
sounds
of
her
in
marcia
'
s
recalled
accents
their
acquaintance
though
so
fervid
had
been
too
brief
for
such
lingering
there
came
a
time
when
he
learnt
through
a
trustworthy
channel
two
pieces
of
news
affecting
himself
one
was
the
marriage
of
avice
caro
with
her
cousin
the
other
that
the
bencombs
had
started
on
a
tour
round
the
world
which
was
to
include
a
visit
to
a
relation
of
mr
bencomb
'
s
who
was
a
banker
in
san
francisco
since
retiring
from
his
former
large
business
the
stone
merchant
had
not
known
what
to
do
with
his
leisure
and
finding
that
travel
benefited
his
health
he
had
decided
to
indulge
himself
thus
although
he
was
not
so
informed
pierston
concluded
that
marcia
had
discovered
that
nothing
was
likely
to
happen
as
a
consequence
of
their
elopement
and
that
she
had
accompanied
her
parents
he
was
more
than
ever
struck
with
what
this
signified
her
father
'
s
obstinate
antagonism
to
her
union
with
one
of
his
blood
and
name
by
degrees
pierston
began
to
trace
again
the
customary
lines
of
his
existence
and
his
profession
occupied
him
much
as
of
old
the
next
year
or
two
only
once
brought
him
tidings
through
some
residents
at
his
former
home
of
the
movements
of
the
bencombs
the
extended
voyage
of
marcia
'
s
parents
had
given
them
quite
a
zest
for
other
scenes
and
countries
and
it
was
said
that
her
father
a
man
still
in
vigorous
health
except
at
brief
intervals
was
utilizing
the
outlook
which
his
cosmopolitanism
afforded
him
by
investing
capital
in
foreign
undertakings
what
he
had
supposed
turned
out
to
be
true
marcia
was
with
them
no
necessity
for
joining
him
had
arisen
and
thus
the
separation
of
himself
and
his
nearly
married
wife
by
common
consent
was
likely
to
be
a
permanent
one
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
scarce
ever
again
discover
the
carnate
dwelling
-
place
of
the
haunting
minion
of
his
imagination
having
gone
so
near
to
matrimony
with
marcia
as
to
apply
for
a
licence
he
had
felt
for
a
long
while
morally
bound
to
her
by
the
incipient
contract
and
would
not
intentionally
look
about
him
in
search
of
the
vanished
ideality
thus
during
the
first
year
of
miss
bencomb
'
s
absence
when
absolutely
bound
to
keep
faith
with
the
elusive
one
'
s
late
incarnation
if
she
should
return
to
claim
him
this
man
of
the
odd
fancy
would
sometimes
tremble
at
the
thought
of
what
would
become
of
his
solemn
intention
if
the
phantom
were
suddenly
to
disclose
herself
in
an
unexpected
quarter
and
seduce
him
before
he
was
aware
once
or
twice
he
imagined
that
he
saw
her
in
the
distance
at
the
end
of
a
street
on
the
far
sands
of
a
shore
in
a
window
in
a
meadow
at
the
opposite
side
of
a
railway
station
but
he
determinedly
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
the
other
way
during
the
many
uneventful
seasons
that
followed
marcia
'
s
stroke
of
independence
(
for
which
he
was
not
without
a
secret
admiration
at
times
)
jocelyn
threw
into
plastic
creations
that
ever
-
bubbling
spring
of
emotion
which
without
some
conduit
into
space
will
surge
upwards
and
ruin
all
but
the
greatest
men
it
was
probably
owing
to
this
certainly
not
on
account
of
any
care
or
anxiety
for
such
a
result
that
he
was
successful
in
his
art
successful
by
a
seemingly
sudden
spurt
which
carried
him
at
one
bound
over
the
hindrances
of
years
he
prospered
without
effort
he
was
a
r
a
but
recognitions
of
this
sort
social
distinctions
which
he
had
once
coveted
so
keenly
seemed
to
have
no
utility
for
him
now
by
the
accident
of
being
a
bachelor
he
was
floating
in
society
without
any
soul
-
anchorage
or
shrine
that
he
could
call
his
own
and
for
want
of
a
domestic
centre
round
which
honours
might
crystallize
they
dispersed
impalpably
without
accumulating
and
adding
weight
to
his
material
well
-
being
he
would
have
gone
on
working
with
his
chisel
with
just
as
much
zest
if
his
creations
had
been
doomed
to
meet
no
mortal
eye
but
his
own
this
indifference
to
the
popular
reception
of
his
dream
-
figures
lent
him
a
curious
artistic
aplomb
that
carried
him
through
the
gusts
of
opinion
without
suffering
them
to
disturb
his
inherent
bias
the
study
of
beauty
was
his
only
joy
for
years
onward
in
the
streets
he
would
observe
a
face
or
a
fraction
of
a
face
which
seemed
to
express
to
a
hair
'
s
-
breadth
in
mutable
flesh
what
he
was
at
that
moment
wishing
to
express
in
durable
shape
he
would
dodge
and
follow
the
owner
like
a
detective
in
omnibus
in
cab
in
steam
-
boat
through
crowds
into
shops
churches
theatres
public
-
houses
and
slums
mostly
when
at
close
quarters
to
be
disappointed
for
his
pains
in
these
professional
beauty
-
chases
he
sometimes
cast
his
eye
across
the
thames
to
the
wharves
on
the
south
side
and
to
that
particular
one
whereat
his
father
'
s
tons
of
freestone
were
daily
landed
from
the
ketches
of
the
south
coast
he
could
occasionally
discern
the
white
blocks
lying
there
vast
cubes
so
persistently
nibbled
by
his
parent
from
his
island
rock
in
the
english
channel
that
it
seemed
as
if
in
time
it
would
be
nibbled
all
away
one
thing
it
passed
him
to
understand
on
what
field
of
observation
the
poets
and
philosophers
based
their
assumption
that
the
passion
of
love
was
intensest
in
youth
and
burnt
lower
as
maturity
advanced
it
was
possibly
because
of
his
utter
domestic
loneliness
that
during
the
productive
interval
which
followed
the
first
years
of
marcia
'
s
departure
when
he
was
drifting
along
from
five
-
and
-
twenty
to
eight
-
and
-
thirty
pierston
occasionally
loved
with
an
ardour
though
it
is
true
also
with
a
self
-
control
unknown
to
him
when
he
was
green
in
judgment
his
whimsical
isle
-
bred
fancy
had
grown
to
be
such
an
emotion
that
the
well
-
beloved
now
again
visible
was
always
existing
somewhere
near
him
for
months
he
would
find
her
on
the
stage
of
a
theatre
then
she
would
flit
away
leaving
the
poor
empty
carcase
that
had
lodged
her
to
mumm
on
as
best
it
could
without
her
a
sorry
lay
figure
to
his
eyes
heaped
with
imperfections
and
sullied
with
commonplace
she
would
reappear
it
might
be
in
an
at
first
unnoticed
lady
met
at
some
fashionable
evening
party
exhibition
bazaar
or
dinner
to
flit
from
her
in
turn
after
a
few
months
and
stand
as
a
graceful
shop
-
girl
at
some
large
drapery
warehouse
into
which
he
had
strayed
on
an
unaccustomed
errand
then
she
would
forsake
this
figure
and
redisclose
herself
in
the
guise
of
some
popular
authoress
piano
-
player
or
fiddleress
at
whose
shrine
he
would
worship
for
perhaps
a
twelvemonth
once
she
was
a
dancing
-
girl
at
the
royal
moorish
palace
of
varieties
though
during
her
whole
continuance
at
that
establishment
he
never
once
exchanged
a
word
with
her
nor
did
she
first
or
last
ever
dream
of
his
existence
he
knew
that
a
ten
-
minutes
'
conversation
in
the
wings
with
the
substance
would
send
the
elusive
haunter
scurrying
fearfully
away
into
some
other
even
less
accessible
mask
-
figure
she
was
a
blonde
a
brunette
tall
petite
svelte
straight
-
featured
full
curvilinear
only
one
quality

unalterable

instability
of

phrase

was
permanent
in
her
but

said
to
himself
that
this
experience
of
mine

idiosyncrasy

whatever
it
is

would

waste

sober
business
for
me
for
all
these
dreams
he
translated
into
plaster
and
found
that
by
them
he
was
hitting
a
public
taste
he
had
never
deliberately
aimed
at
and
mostly
despised
he
was
in
short
in
danger
of
drifting
away
from
a
solid
artistic
reputation
to
a
popularity
which
might
possibly
be
as
brief
as
it

brilliant
and
exciting

in

of
these
long
years
pierston
'
s
artistic
emotions
were
abruptly
suspended
by
the
news
of
his
father
'
s
sudden
death
at
sandbourne
whither
the
stone
-
merchant
had
gone
for
a
change
of
air
by
the
advice
of
his
physician
mr
pierston
senior
it
must
be
admitted
had
been
something
miserly
in
his
home
life
as
marcia
had
so
rashly
reminded
his
son
but
he
had
never
stinted
jocelyn
he
had
been
rather
a
hard
taskmaster
though
as
a
paymaster
trustworthy
a
ready
-
money
man
just
and
ungenerous
to
every
one
'
s
surprise
the
capital
he
had
accumulated
in
the
stone
trade
was
of
large
amount
for
a
business
so
unostentatiously
carried
on
much
larger
than
jocelyn
had
ever
regarded
as
possible
while
the
son
had
been
modelling
and
chipping
his
ephemeral
fancies
into
perennial
shapes
the
father
had
been
persistently
chiselling
for
half
a
century
at
the
crude
original
matter
of
those
shapes
the
stern
isolated
rock
in
the
channel
and
by
the
aid
of
his
cranes
and
pulleys
his
trolleys
and
his
boats
had
sent
off
his
spoil
to
all
parts
of
great
britain
when
jocelyn
had
wound
up
everything
and
disposed
of
the
business
as
recommended
by
his
father
'
s
will
he
found
himself
enabled
to
add
about
eighty
thousand
pounds
to
the
twelve
thousand
which
he
already
possessed
from
professional
and
other
sources
after
arranging
for
the
sale
of
some
freehold
properties
in
the
island
other
than
quarries
for
he
did
not
intend
to
reside
there
he
returned
to
town
he
often
wondered
what
had
become
of
marcia
he
had
promised
never
to
trouble
her
nor
for
a
whole
twenty
years
had
he
done
so
though
he
had
often
sighed
for
her
as
a
friend
of
sterling
common
sense
in
practical
difficulties
her
parents
were
he
believed
dead
and
she
he
knew

never
gone
back
to
the
isle
possibly
she
had
formed
some
new
tie
abroad
and
had
made
it
next
to
impossible
to
discover
her
by
her
old
name
a
reposeful
time
ensued
almost
his
first
entry
into
society
after
his
father
'
s
death
occurred
one
evening
when
for
want
of
knowing
what
better
to
do
he
responded
to
an
invitation
sent
by
one
of
the
few
ladies
of
rank
whom
he
numbered
among
his
friends
and
set
out
in
a
cab
for
the
square
wherein
she
lived
during
three
or
four
months
of
the
year
the
hansom
turned
the
corner
and
he
obtained
a
raking
view
of
the
houses
along
the
north
side
of
which
hers
was
one
with
the
familiar
linkman
at
the
door
there
were
chinese
lanterns
too
on
the
balcony
he
perceived
in
a
moment
that
the
customary
'
small
and
early
'
reception
had
resolved
itself
on
this
occasion
into
something
very
like
great
and
late
he
remembered
that
there
had
just
been
a
political
crisis
which
accounted
for
the
enlargement
of
the
countess
of
channelcliffe
'
s
assembly
for
hers
was
one
of
the
neutral
or
non
-
political
houses
at
which
party
politics
are
more
freely
agitated
than
at
the
professedly
party
gatherings
there
was
such
a
string
of
carriages
that
pierston
did
not
wait
to
take
his
turn
at
the
door
but
unobtrusively
alighted
some
yards
off
and
walked
forward
he
had
to
pause
a
moment
behind
the
wall
of
spectators
which
barred
his
way
and
as
he
paused
some
ladies
in
white
cloaks
crossed
from
their
carriages
to
the
door
on
the
carpet
laid
for
the
purpose
he
had
not
seen
their
faces
nothing
of
them
but
vague
forms
and
yet
he
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
presentiment
its
gist
was
that
he
might
be
going
to
re
-
encounter
the
well
-
beloved
that
night
after
her
recent
long
hiding
she
meant
to
reappear
and
intoxicate
him
that
liquid
sparkle
of
her
eye
that
lingual
music
that
turn
of
the
head
how
well
he
knew
it
all
despite
the
many
superficial
changes
and
how
instantly
he
would
recognize
it
under
whatever
complexion
contour
accent
height
or
carriage
that
it
might
choose
to
masquerade
pierston
'
s
other
conjecture
that
the
night
was
to
be
a
lively
political
one
received
confirmation
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
hall
where
a
simmer
of
excitement
was
perceptible
as
surplus
or
overflow
from
above
down
the
staircase
a
feature
which
he
had
always
noticed
to
be
present
when
any
climax
or
sensation
had
been
reached
in
the
world
of
party
and
faction
'
and
where
have
you
been
keeping
yourself
so
long
young
man
said
his
hostess
archly
when
he
had
shaken
hands
with
her
pierston
was
always
regarded
as
a
young
man
though
he
was
now
about
forty
o
yes
of
course
i
remember
she
added
looking
serious
in
a
moment
at
thought
of
his
loss
the
countess
was
a
woman
with
a
good
-
natured
manner
verging
on
that
oft
-
claimed
feminine
quality
humour
and
was
quickly
sympathetic
she
then
began
to
tell
him
of
a
scandal
in
the
political
side
to
which
she
nominally
belonged
one
that
had
come
out
of
the
present
crisis
and
that
as
for
herself
she
had
sworn
to
abjure
politics
for
ever
on
account
of
it
so
that
he
was
to
regard
her
forthwith
as
a
more
neutral
householder
than
ever
by
this
time
some
more
people
had
surged
upstairs
and
pierston
prepared
to
move
on
'
you
are
looking
for
somebody
i
can
see
that
said
she
'
yes
a
lady
said
pierston
'
tell
me
her
name
and
i
will
try
to
think
if
she
is
here
'
i
cannot
i
do
not
know
it
he
said
'
indeed
what
is
she
like
'
i
cannot
describe
her
not
even
her
complexion
or
dress
lady
channelcliffe
looked
a
pout
as
if
she
thought
he
were
teasing
her
and
he
moved
on
in
the
current
the
fact
was
that
for
a
moment
pierston
fancied
he
had
made
the
sensational
discovery
that
the
one
he
was
in
search
of
lurked
in
the
person
of
the
very
hostess
he
had
conversed
with
who
was
charming
always
and
particularly
charming
to
-
night
he
was
just
feeling
an
incipient
consternation
at
the
possibility
of
such
a
jade
'
s
trick
in
his
beloved
who
had
once
before
chosen
to
embody
herself
as
a
married
woman
though
happily
at
that
time
with
no
serious
results
however
he
felt
that
he
had
been
mistaken
and
that
the
fancy
had
been
solely
owing
to
the
highly
charged
electric
condition
in
which
he
had
arrived
by
reason
of
his
recent
isolation
the
whole
set
of
rooms
formed
one
great
utterance
of
the
opinions
of
the
hour
the
gods
of
party
were
present
with
their
embattled
seraphim
but
the
brilliancy
of
manner
and
form
in
the
handling
of
public
questions
was
only
less
conspicuous
than
the
paucity
of
original
ideas
no
principles
of
wise
government
had
place
in
any
mind
a
blunt
and
jolly
personalism
as
to
the
ins
and
outs
animating
all
but
jocelyn
'
s
interest
did
not
run
in
this
stream
he
was
like
a
stone
in
a
purling
brook
waiting
for
some
peculiar
floating
object
to
be
brought
towards
him
and
to
stick
upon
his
mental
surface
thus
looking
for
the
next
new
version
of
the
fair
figure
he
did
not
consider
at
the
moment
though
he
had
done
so
at
other
times
that
this
presentiment
of
meeting
her
was
of
all
presentiments
just
the
sort
of
one
to
work
out
its
own
fulfilment
he
looked
for
her
in
the
knot
of
persons
gathered
round
a
past
prime
minister
who
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
largest
room
discoursing
in
the
genial
almost
jovial
manner
natural
to
him
at
these
times
the
two
or
three
ladies
forming
his
audience
had
been
joined
by
another
in
black
and
white
and
it
was
on
her
that
pierston
'
s
attention
was
directed
as
well
as
the
great
statesman
'
s
whose
first
sheer
gaze
at
her
expressing
'
who
are
you
almost
audibly
changed
into
an
interested
listening
look
as
the
few
words
she
spoke
were
uttered
for
the
minister
differed
from
many
of
his
standing
in
being
extremely
careful
not
to
interrupt
a
timid
speaker
giving
way
in
an
instant
if
anybody
else
began
with
him
nobody
knew
better
than
himself
that
all
may
learn
and
his
manner
was
that
of
an
unconceited
man
who
could
catch
an
idea
readily
even
if
he
could
not
undertake
to
create
one
the
lady
told
her
little
story
whatever
it
was
jocelyn
could
not
hear
it
the
statesman
laughed
haugh
-
haugh
-
haugh
the
lady
blushed
jocelyn
wrought
up
to
a
high
tension
by
the
aforesaid
presentiment
that
his
shelleyan
'
one
-
shape
-
of
-
many
-
names
'
was
about
to
reappear
paid
little
heed
to
the
others
watching
for
a
full
view
of
the
lady
who
had
won
his
attention
that
lady
remained
for
the
present
partially
screened
by
her
neighbours
a
diversion
was
caused
by
lady
channelcliffe
bringing
up
somebody
to
present
to
the
ex
-
minister
the
ladies
got
mixed
and
jocelyn
lost
sight
of
the
one
whom
he
was
beginning
to
suspect
as
the
stealthily
returned
absentee
he
looked
for
her
in
a
kindly
young
lady
of
the
house
his
hostess
'
s
relation
who
appeared
to
more
advantage
that
night
than
she
had
ever
done
before
in
a
sky
-
blue
dress
which
had
nothing
between
it
and
the
fair
skin
of
her
neck
lending
her
an
unusually
soft
and
sylph
-
like
aspect
she
saw
him
and
they
converged
her
look
of
'
what
do
you
think
of
me
now
was
suggested
he
knew
by
the
thought
that
the
last
time
they
met
she
had
appeared
under
the
disadvantage
of
mourning
clothes
on
a
wet
day
in
a
country
-
house
where
everybody
was
cross
'
i
have
some
new
photographs
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
whether
they
are
good
she
said
mind
you
are
to
tell
me
truly
and
no
favour
she
produced
the
pictures
from
an
adjoining
drawer
and
they
sat
down
together
upon
an
ottoman
for
the
purpose
of
examination
the
portraits
taken
by
the
last
fashionable
photographer
were
very
good
and
he
told
her
so
but
as
he
spoke
and
compared
them
his
mind
was
fixed
on
something
else
than
the
mere
judgment
he
wondered
whether
the
elusive
one
were
indeed
in
the
frame
of
this
girl
he
looked
up
at
her
to
his
surprise
her
mind
too
was
on
other
things
bent
than
on
the
pictures
her
eyes
were
glancing
away
to
distant
people
she
was
apparently
considering
the
effect
she
was
producing
upon
them
by
this
cosy
tete
-
a
-
tete
with
pierston
and
upon
one
in
particular
a
man
of
thirty
of
military
appearance
whom
pierston
did
not
know
quite
convinced
now
that
no
phantom
belonging
to
him
was
contained
in
the
outlines
of
the
present
young
lady
he
could
coolly
survey
her
as
he
responded
they
were
both
doing
the
same
thing
each
was
pretending
to
be
deeply
interested
in
what
the
other
was
talking
about
the
attention
of
the
two
alike
flitting
away
to
other
corners
of
the
room
even
when
the
very
point
of
their
discourse
was
pending
no
he
had
not
seen
her
yet
he
was
not
going
to
see
her
apparently
to
-
night
she
was
scared
away
by
the
twanging
political
atmosphere
but
he
still
moved
on
searchingly
hardly
heeding
certain
spectral
imps
other
than
aphroditean
who
always
haunted
these
places
and
jeeringly
pointed
out
that
under
the
white
hair
of
this
or
that
ribanded
old
man
with
a
forehead
grown
wrinkled
over
treaties
which
had
swayed
the
fortunes
of
europe
with
a
voice
which
had
numbered
sovereigns
among
its
respectful
listeners
might
be
a
heart
that
would
go
inside
a
nut
-
shell
that
beneath
this
or
that
white
rope
of
pearl
and
pink
bosom
might
lie
the
half
-
lung
which
had
by
hook
or
by
crook
to
sustain
its
possessor
above
-
ground
till
the
wedding
-
day
at
that
moment
he
encountered
his
amiable
host
and
almost
simultaneously
caught
sight
of
the
lady
who
had
at
first
attracted
him
and
then
had
disappeared
their
eyes
met
far
off
as
they
were
from
each
other
pierston
laughed
inwardly
it
was
only
in
ticklish
excitement
as
to
whether
this
was
to
prove
a
true
trouvaille
and
with
no
instinct
to
mirth
for
when
under
the
eyes
of
his
jill
-
o
'
-
the
-
wisp
he
was
more
inclined
to
palpitate
like
a
sheep
in
a
fair
however
for
the
minute
he
had
to
converse
with
his
host
lord
channelcliffe
and
almost
the
first
thing
that
friend
said
to
him
was
who
is
that
pretty
woman
in
the
black
dress
with
the
white
fluff
about
it
and
the
pearl
necklace
'
i
do
not

jocelyn
with
incipient
jealousy
i
was
just
going
to
ask
the
same
thing
'

we
shall
find
out
presently

suppose
i

my
wife

a
hand
came
upon
his
shoulder

turned
back
for
an
instant

lost
her
husband
two
or
three
years
ago
very
shortly
after
their
marriage
lord
channelcliffe
became
absorbed
into
some
adjoining
dignitary
of
the
church
and
pierston
was
left
to
pursue
his
quest
alone
a
young
friend
of
his
the
lady
mabella
buttermead
who
appeared
in
a
cloud
of
muslin
and
was
going
on
to
a
ball
had
been
brought
against
him
by
the
tide
a
warm
-
hearted
emotional
girl
was
lady
mabella
who
laughed
at
the
humorousness
of
being
alive
she
asked
him
whither
he
was
bent
and
he
told
her
'
o
yes
i
know
her
very
well
said
lady
mabella
eagerly
she
told
me
one
day
that
she
particularly
wished
to
meet
you
poor
thing
so
sad
she
lost
her
husband
well
it
was
a
long
time
ago
now
certainly
women
ought
not
to
marry
and
lay
themselves
open
to
such
catastrophes
ought
they
mr
pierston
_
i
_
never
shall
i
am
determined
never
to
run
such
a
risk
now
do
you
think
i
shall
'
marry
o
no
never
said
pierston
drily
'
that
'
s
very
satisfying
but
mabella
was
scarcely
comfortable
under
his
answer
even
though
jestingly
returned
and
she
added
but
sometimes
i
think
i
may
just
for
the
fun
of
it
now
we
will
steer
across
to
her
and
catch
her
and
i
will
introduce
you
but
we
shall
never
get
to
her
at
this
rate
'
never
unless
we
adopt
the
ugly
rush
like
the
citizens
who
follow
the
lord
mayor
'
s
show
they
talked
and
inched
towards
the
desired
one
who
as
she
discoursed
with
a
neighbour
seemed
to
be
of
those
female
forms
whose
gestures
beam
with
mind
seen
by
the
poet
in
his
vision
of
the
golden
city
of
islam
their
progress
was
continually
checked
pierston
was
as
he
had
sometimes
seemed
to
be
in
a
dream
unable
to
advance
towards
the
object
of
pursuit
unless
he
could
have
gathered
up
his
feet
into
the
air
after
ten
minutes
given
to
a
preoccupied
regard
of

with

he
ploughed
his
way

that

they
were
aiming
at

drew
near
to

was
drinking
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
back
drawing

room
'
my
dear
nichola
we
thought
we
should
never
get
to
you
because
it
is
worse
to
-
night
owing
to
these
dreadful
politics
but
we
'
ve
done
it
and
she
proceeded
to
tell
her
friend
of
pierston
'
s
existence
hard
by
it
seemed
that
the
widow
really
did
wish
to
know
him
and
that
lady
mabella
buttermead
had
not
indulged
in
one
of
the
too
frequent
inventions
in
that
kind
when
the
youngest
of
the
trio
had
made
the
pair
acquainted
with
each
other
she
left
them
to
talk
to
a
younger
man
than
the
sculptor
mrs
pine
-
avon
'
s
black
velvets
and
silks
with
their
white
accompaniments
finely
set
off
the
exceeding
fairness
of
her
neck
and
shoulders
which
though
unwhitened
artificially
were
without
a
speck
or
blemish
of
the
least
degree
the
gentle
thoughtful
creature
she
had
looked
from
a
distance
she
now
proved
herself
to
be
she
held
also
sound
rather
than
current
opinions
on
the
plastic
arts
and
was
the
first
intellectual
woman
he
had
seen
there
that
night
except
one
or
two
as
aforesaid
they
soon
became
well
acquainted
and
at
a
pause
in
their
conversation
noticed
the
fresh
excitement
caused
by
the
arrival
of
some
late
comers
with
more
news
the
latter
had
been
brought
by
a
rippling
bright
-
eyed
lady
in
black
who
made
the
men
listen
to
her
whether
they
would
or
no
'
i
am
glad
i
am
an
outsider
said
jocelyn
'
s
acquaintance
now
seated
on
a
sofa
beside
which
he
was
standing
i
would
not
be
like
my
cousin
over
there
for
the
world
she
thinks
her
husband
will
be
turned
out
at
the
next
election
and
she
is
quite
wild
'
yes
it
is
mostly
the
women
who
are
the
gamesters
the
men
only
the
cards
the
pity
is
that
politics
are
looked
on
as
being
a
game
for
politicians
just
as
cricket
is
a
game
for
cricketers
not
as
the
serious
duties
of
political
trustees
'
how
few
of
us
ever
think
or
feel
that
the
nation
of
every
country
dwells
in
the
cottage
as
somebody
says
'
yes
though
i
wonder
to
hear
you
quote
that
'
o
i
am
of
no
party
though
my
relations
are
there
can
be
only
one
best
course
at
all
times
and
the
wisdom
of
the
nation
should
be
directed
to
finding
it
instead
of
zigzagging
in
two
courses
according
to
the
will
of
the
party
which
happens
to
have
the
upper
hand
having
started
thus
they
found
no
difficulty
in
agreeing
on
many
points
when
pierston
went
downstairs
from
that
assembly
at
a
quarter
to
one
and
passed
under
the
steaming
nostrils
of
an
ambassador
'
s
horses
to
a
hansom
which
waited
for
him
against
the
railing
of
the
square
he
had
an
impression
that
the
beloved
had
re
-
emerged
from
the
shadows
without
any
hint
or
initiative
from
him
to
whom
indeed
such
re
-
emergence
was
an
unquestionably
awkward
thing
in
this
he
was
aware
however
that
though
it
might
be
now
as
heretofore
the
loved
who
danced
before
him
it
was
the
goddess
behind
her
who
pulled
the
string
of
that
jumping
jill
he
had
lately
been
trying
his
artist
hand
again
on
the
dea
'
s
form
in
every
conceivable
phase
and
mood
he
had
become
a
one
-
part
man
a
presenter
of
her
only
but
his
efforts
had
resulted
in
failures
in
her
implacable
vanity
she
might
be
punishing
him
anew
for
presenting
her
so
deplorably
he
could
not
forget
mrs
pine
-
avon
'
s
eyes
though
he
remembered
nothing
of
her
other
facial
details
they
were
round
inquiring
luminous
how
that
chestnut
hair
of
hers
had
shone
it
required
no
tiara
to
set
it
off
like
that
of
the
dowager
he
had
seen
there
who
had
put
ten
thousand
pounds
upon
her
head
to
make
herself
look
worse
than
she
would
have
appeared
with
the
ninepenny
muslin
cap
of
a
servant
woman
now
the
question
was
ought
he
to
see
her
again
he
had
his
doubts
but
unfortunately
for
discretion
just
when
he
was
coming
out
of
the
rooms
he
had
encountered
an
old
lady
of
seventy
his
friend
mrs
brightwalton
the
honourable
mrs
brightwalton
and
she
had
hastily
asked
him
to
dinner
for
the
day
after
the
morrow
stating
in
the
honest
way
he
knew
so
well
that
she
had
heard
he
was
out
of
town
or
she
would
have
asked
him
two
or
three
weeks
ago
now
of
all
social
things
that
pierston
liked
it
was
to
be
asked
to
dinner
off
-
hand
as
a
stopgap
in
place
of
some
bishop
earl
or
under
-
secretary
who
could
not
come
and
when
the
invitation
was
supplemented
by
the
tidings
that
the
lady
who
had
so
impressed
him
was
to
be
one
of
the
guests
he
had
promised
instantly
at
the
dinner
he
took
down
mrs
pine
-
avon
upon
his
arm
and
talked
to
nobody
else
during
the
meal
afterwards
they
kept
apart
awhile
in
the
drawing
-
room
for
form
'
s
sake
but
eventually
gravitated
together
again
and
finished
the
evening
in
each
other
'
s
company
when
shortly
after
eleven
he
came
away
he
felt
almost
certain
that
within
those
luminous
grey
eyes
the
one
of
his
eternal
fidelity
had
verily
taken
lodgings
and
for
a
long
lease
but
this
was
not
all
at
parting
he
had
almost
involuntarily
given
her
hand
a
pressure
of
a
peculiar
and
indescribable
kind
a
little
response
from
her
like
a
mere
pulsation
of
the
same
sort
told
him
that
the
impression
she
had
made
upon
him
was
reciprocated
she
was
in
a
word
willing
to
go
on
but
was
he
able
there
had
not
been
much
harm
in
the
flirtation
thus
far
but
did
she
know
his
history
the
curse
upon
his
nature
that
he
was
the
wandering
jew
of
the
love
-
world
how
restlessly
ideal
his
fancies
were
how
the
artist
in
him
had
consumed
the
wooer
how
he
was
in
constant
dread
lest
he
should
wrong
some
woman
twice
as
good
as
himself
by
seeming
to
mean
what
he
fain
would
mean
but
could
not
how
useless
he
was
likely
to
be
for
practical
steps
towards
householding
though
he
was
all
the
while
pining
for
domestic
life
he
was
now
over
forty
she
was
probably
thirty
and
he
dared
not
make
unmeaning
love
with
the
careless
selfishness
of
a
younger
man
it
was
unfair
to
go
further
without
telling
her
even
though
hitherto
such
explicitness
had
not
been
absolutely
demanded
he
determined
to
call
immediately
on
the
new
incarnation
she
lived
not
far
from
the
long
fashionable
hamptonshire
square
and
he
went
thither
with
expectations
of
having
a
highly
emotional
time
at
least
but
somehow
the
very
bell
-
pull
seemed
cold
although
she
had
so
earnestly
asked
him
to
come
as
the
house
spoke
so
spoke
the
occupant
much
to
the
astonishment
of
the
sculptor
the
doors
he
passed
through
seemed
as
if
they
had
not
been
opened
for
a
month
and
entering
the
large
drawing
-
room
he
beheld
in
an
arm
-
chair
in
the
far
distance
a
lady
whom
he
journeyed
across
the
carpet
to
reach
and
ultimately
did
reach
to
be
sure
it
was
mrs
nichola
pine
-
avon
but
frosted
over
indescribably
raising
her
eyes
in
a
slightly
inquiring
manner
from
the
book
she
was
reading
she
leant
back
in
the
chair
as
if
soaking
herself
in
luxurious
sensations
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
and
replied
to
his
greeting
with
a
few
commonplace
words
the
unfortunate
jocelyn
though
recuperative
to
a
degree
was
at
first
terribly
upset
by
this
reception
he
had
distinctly
begun
to
love
nichola
and
he
felt
sick
and
almost
resentful
but
happily
his
affection
was
incipient
as
yet
and
a
sudden
sense
of
the
ridiculous
in
his
own
position
carried
him
to
the
verge
of
risibility
during
the
scene
she
signified
a
chair
and
began
the
critical
study
of
some
rings
she
wore
they
talked
over
the
day
'
s
news
and
then
an
organ
began
to
grind
outside
the
tune
was
a
rollicking
air
he
had
heard
at
some
music
-
hall
and
by
way
of
a
diversion
he
asked
her
if
she
knew
the
composition
'
no
i
do
not
she
replied
'
now
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
said
he
gravely
it
is
based
on
a
sound
old
melody
called
the
jilt
'
s
hornpipe
just
as
they
turn
madeira
into
port
in
the
space
of
a
single
night
so
this
old
air
has
been
taken
and
doctored
and
twisted
about
and
brought
out
as
a
new
popular
ditty
'
indeed
'
if
you
are
in
the
habit
of
going
much
to
the
music
-
halls
or
the
burlesque
theatres
'
yes
'
you
would
find
this
is
often
done
with
excellent
effect
she
thawed
a
little
and
then
they
went
on
to
talk
about
her
house
which
had
been
newly
painted
and
decorated
with
greenish
-
blue
satin
up
to
the
height
of
a
person
'
s
head
an
arrangement
that
somewhat
improved
her
slightly
faded
though
still
pretty
face
and
was
helped
by
the
awnings
over
the
windows
'
yes
i
have
had
my
house
some
years
she
observed
complacently
and
i
like
it
better
every
year
'
do
not
you
feel
lonely
in
it
sometimes
'
o
never
however
before
he
rose
she
grew
friendly
to
some
degree
and
when
he
left
just
after
the
arrival
of
three
opportune
young
ladies
she
seemed
regretful
she
asked
him
to
come
again
and
he
thought
he
would
tell
the
truth
no
i
shall
not
care
to
come
again
he
answered
in
a
tone
inaudible
to
the
young
ladies
she
followed
him
to
the
door
what
an
uncivil
thing
to
say
she
murmured
in
surprise
'
it
is
rather
uncivil
good
-
bye
said
pierston
as
a
punishment
she
did
not
ring
the
bell
but
left
him
to
find
his
way
out
as
he
could
now
what
the
devil
this
means
i
cannot
tell
he
said
to
himself
reflecting
stock
-
still
for
a
moment
on
the
stairs
and
yet
the
meaning
was
staring
him
in
the
face
meanwhile
one
of
the
three
young
ladies
had
said
what
interesting
man
was
that
with
his
lovely
head
of
hair
i
saw
him
at
lady
channelcliffe
'
s
the
other
night
'
jocelyn
pierston
'
o
nichola
that
is
too
bad
to
let
him
go
in
that
shabby
way
when
i
would
have
given
anything
to
know
him
i
have
wanted
to
know
him
ever
since
i
found
out
how
much
his
experiences
had
dictated
his
statuary
and
i
discovered
them
by
seeing
in
a
jersey
paper
of
the
marriage
of
a
person
supposed
to
be
his
wife
who
ran
off
with
him
many
years
ago
do
not
you
know
and
then
would
not
marry
him
in
obedience
to
some
novel
social
principles
she
had
invented
for
herself
'
o
did
not
he
marry
her
said
mrs
pine
-
avon
with
a
start
why
i
heard
only
yesterday
that
he
did
though
they
have
lived
apart
ever
since
'
quite
a
mistake
said
the
young
lady
how
i
wish
i
could
run
after
him
but
jocelyn
was
receding
from
the
pretty
widow
'
s
house
with
long
strides
he
went
out
very
little
during
the
next
few
days
but
about
a
week
later
he
kept
an
engagement
to
dine
with
lady
iris
speedwell
whom
he
never
neglected
because
she
was
the
brightest
hostess
in
london
by
some
accident
he
arrived
rather
early
lady
iris
had
left
the
drawing
-
room
for
a
moment
to
see
that
all
was
right
in
the
dining
-
room
and
when
he
was
shown
in
there
stood
alone
in
the
lamplight
nichola
pine
-
avon
she
had
been
the
first
arrival
he
had
not
in
the
least
expected
to
meet
her
there
further
than
that
in
a
general
sense
at
lady
iris
'
s
you
expected
to
meet
everybody
she
had
just
come
out
of
the
cloak
-
room
and
was
so
tender
and
even
apologetic
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
be
other
than
friendly
as
the
other
guests
dropped
in
the
pair
retreated
into
a
shady
corner
and
she
talked
beside
him
till
all
moved
off
for
the
eating
and
drinking
he
had
not
been
appointed
to
take
her
across
to
the
dining
-
room
but
at
the
table
found
her
exactly
opposite
she
looked
very
charming
between
the
candles
and
then
suddenly
it
dawned
upon
him
that
her
previous
manner
must
have
originated
in
some
false
report
about
marcia
of
whose
existence
he
had
not
heard
for
years
anyhow
he
was
not
disposed
to
resent
an
inexplicability
in
womankind
having
found
that
it
usually
arose
independently
of
fact
reason
probability
or
his
own
deserts
so
he
dined
on
catching
her
eyes
and
the
few
pretty
words
she
made
opportunity
to
project
across
the
table
to
him
now
and
then
he
was
courteously
responsive
only
but
mrs
pine
-
avon
herself
distinctly
made
advances
he
re
-
admired
her
while
at
the
same
time
her
conduct
in
her
own
house
had
been
enough
to
check
his
confidence
enough
even
to
make
him
doubt
if
the
well
-
beloved
really
resided
within
those
contours
or
had
ever
been
more
than
the
most
transitory
passenger
through
that
interesting
and
accomplished
soul
he
was
pondering
this
question
yet
growing
decidedly
moved
by
the
playful
pathos
of
her
attitude
when
by
chance
searching
his
pocket
for
his
handkerchief
something
crackled
and
he
felt
there
an
unopened
letter
which
had
arrived
at
the
moment
he
was
leaving
his
house
and
he
had
slipped
into
his
coat
to
read
in
the
cab
as
he
drove
along
pierston
drew
it
sufficiently
forth
to
observe
by
the
post
-
mark
that
it
came
from
his
natal
isle
having
hardly
a
correspondent
in
that
part
of
the
world
now
he
began
to
conjecture
on
the
possible
sender
the
lady
on
his
right
whom
he
had
brought
in
was
a
leading
actress
of
the
town
indeed
of
the
united
kingdom
and
america
for
that
matter
a
creature
in
airy
clothing
translucent
like
a
balsam
or
sea
-
anemone
without
shadows
and
in
movement
as
responsive
as
some
highly
lubricated
many
-
wired
machine
which
if
one
presses
a
particular
spring
flies
open
and
reveals
its
works
the
spring
in
the
present
case
was
the
artistic
commendation
she
deserved
and
craved
at
this
particular
moment
she
was
engaged
with
the
man
on
her
own
right
a
representative
of
family
who
talked
positively
and
hollowly
as
if
shouting
down
a
vista
of
five
hundred
years
from
the
feudal
past
the
lady
on
jocelyn
'
s
left
wife
of
a
lord
justice
of
appeal
was
in
like
manner
talking
to
her
companion
on
the
outer
side
so
that
for
the
time
he
was
left
to
himself
he
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
drew
out
his
letter
and
read
it
as
it
lay
upon
his
napkin
nobody
observing
him
so
far
as
he
was
aware
it
came
from
the
wife
of
one
of
his
father
'
s
former
workmen
and
was
concerning
her
son
whom
she
begged
jocelyn
to
recommend
as
candidate
for
some
post
in
town
that
she
wished
him
to
fill
but
the
end
of
the
letter
was
what
arrested
him
'
you
will
be
sorry
to
hear
sir
that
dear
little
avice
caro
as
we
used
to
call
her
in
her
maiden
days
is
dead
she
married
her
cousin
if
you
do
mind
and
went
away
from
here
for
a
good
-
few
years
but
was
left
a
widow
and
came
back
a
twelvemonth
ago
since
when
she
faltered
and
faltered
and
now
she
is
gone
by
imperceptible
and
slow
degrees
the
scene
at
the
dinner
-
table
receded
into
the
background
behind
the
vivid
presentment
of
avice
caro
and
the
old
old
scenes
on
isle
vindilia
which
were
inseparable
from
her
personality
the
dining
room
was
real
no
more
dissolving
under
the
bold
stony
promontory
and
the
incoming
west
sea
the
handsome
marchioness
in
geranium
-
red
and
diamonds
who
was
visible
to
him
on
his
host
'
s
right
hand
opposite
became
one
of
the
glowing
vermilion
sunsets
that
he
had
watched
so
many
times
over
deadman
'
s
bay
with
the
form
of
avice
in
the
foreground
between
his
eyes
and
the
judge
who
sat
next
to
nichola
with
a
chin
so
raw
that
he
must
have
shaved
every
quarter
of
an
hour
during
the
day
intruded
the
face
of
avice
as
she
had
glanced
at
him
in
their
last
parting
the
crannied
features
of
the
evergreen
society
lady
who
if
she
had
been
a
few
years
older
would
have
been
as
old
-
fashioned
as
her
daughter
shaped
themselves
to
the
dusty
quarries
of
his
and
avice
'
s
parents
down
which
he
had
clambered
with
avice
hundreds
of
times
the
ivy
trailing
about
the
table
-
cloth
the
lights
in
the
tall
candlesticks
and
the
bunches
of
flowers
were
transmuted
into
the
ivies
of
the
cliff
-
built
castle
the
tufts
of
seaweed
and
the
lighthouses
on
the
isle
the
salt
airs
of
the
ocean
killed
the
smell
of
the
viands
and
instead
of
the
clatter
of
voices
came
the
monologue
of
the
tide
off
the
beal
more
than
all
nichola
pine
-
avon
lost
the
blooming
radiance
which
she
had
latterly
acquired
she
became
a
woman
of
his
acquaintance
with
no
distinctive
traits
she
seemed
to
grow
material
a
superficies
of
flesh
and
bone
merely
a
person
of
lines
and
surfaces
she
was
a
language
in
living
cipher
no
more
when
the
ladies
had
withdrawn
it
was
just
the
same
the
soul
of
avice
the
only
woman
he
had
never
loved
of
those
who
had
loved
him
surrounded
him
like
a
firmament
art
drew
near
to
him
in
the
person
of
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
portrait
painters
but
there
was
only
one
painter
for
jocelyn
his
own
memory
all
that
was
eminent
in
european
surgery
addressed
him
in
the
person
of
that
harmless
and
unassuming
fogey
whose
hands
had
been
inside
the
bodies
of
hundreds
of
living
men
but
the
lily
-
white
corpse
of
an
obscure
country
-
girl
chilled
the
interest
of
discourse
with
such
a
king
of
operators
reaching
the
drawing
-
room
he
talked
to
his
hostess
though
she
had
entertained
three
-
and
-
twenty
guests
at
her
table
that
night
she
had
known
not
only
what
every
one
of
them
was
saying
and
doing
throughout
the
repast
but
what
every
one
was
thinking
so
being
an
old
friend
she
said
quietly
what
has
been
troubling
you
something
has
i
know
i
have
been
travelling
over
your
face
and
have
seen
it
there
nothing
could
less
express
the
meaning
his
recent
news
had
for
him
than
a
statement
of
its
facts
he
told
of
the
opening
of
the
letter
and
the
discovery
of
the
death
of
an
old
acquaintance
'
the
only
woman
whom
i
never
rightly
valued
i
may
almost
say
he
added
and
therefore
the
only
one
i
shall
ever
regret
whether
she
considered
it
a
sufficient
explanation
or
not
the
woman
of
experiences
accepted
it
as
such
she
was
the
single
lady
of
his
circle
whom
nothing
erratic
in
his
doings
could
surprise
and
he
often
gave
her
stray
ends
of
his
confidence
thus
with
perfect
safety
he
did
not
go
near
mrs
pine
-
avon
again
he
could
not
and
on
leaving
the
house
walked
abstractedly
along
the
streets
till
he
found
himself
at
his
own
door
in
his
room
he
sat
down
and
placing
his
hands
behind
his
head
thought
his
thoughts
anew
at
one
side
of
the
room
stood
an
escritoire
and
from
a
lower
drawer
therein
he
took
out
a
small
box
tightly
nailed
down
he
forced
the
cover
with
the
poker
the
box
contained
a
variety
of
odds
and
ends
which
pierston
had
thrown
into
it
from
time
to
time
in
past
years
for
future
sorting
an
intention
that
he
had
never
carried
out
from
the
melancholy
mass
of
papers
faded
photographs
seals
diaries
withered
flowers
and
such
like
jocelyn
drew
a
little
portrait
one
taken
on
glass
in
the
primitive
days
of
photography
and
framed
with
tinsel
in
the
commonest
way
it
was
avice
caro
as
she
had
appeared
during
the
summer
month
or
two
which
he
had
spent
with
her
on
the
island
twenty
years
before
this
time
her
young
lips
pursed
up
her
hands
meekly
folded
the
effect
of
the
glass
was
to
lend
to
the
picture
much
of
the
softness
characteristic
of
the
original
he
remembered
when
it
was
taken
during
one
afternoon
they
had
spent
together
at
a
neighbouring
watering
-
place
when
he
had
suggested
her
sitting
to
a
touting
artist
on
the
sands
there
being
nothing
else
for
them
to
do
a
long
contemplation
of
the
likeness
completed
in
his
emotions
what
the
letter
had
begun
he
loved
the
woman
dead
and
inaccessible
as
he
had
never
loved
her
in
life
he
had
thought
of
her
but
at
distant
intervals
during
the
twenty
years
since
that
parting
occurred
and
only
as
somebody
he
could
have
wedded
yet
now
the
times
of
youthful
friendship
with
her
in
which
he
had
learnt
every
note
of
her
innocent
nature
flamed
up
into
a
yearning
and
passionate
attachment
embittered
by
regret
beyond
words
that
kiss
which
had
offended
his
dignity
which
she
had
so
childishly
given
him
before
her
consciousness
of
womanhood
had
been
awakened
what
he
would
have
offered
to
have
a
quarter
of
it
now
pierston
was
almost
angry
with
himself
for
his
feelings
of
this
night
so
unreasonably
motivelessly
strong
were
they
towards
the
lost
young
playmate
how
senseless
of
me
he
said
as
he
lay
in
his
lonely
bed
she
had
been
another
man
'
s
wife
almost
the
whole
time
since
he
was
estranged
from
her
and
now
she
was
a
corpse
yet
the
absurdity
did
not
make
his
grief
the
less
and
the
consciousness
of
the
intrinsic
almost
radiant
purity
of
this
newsprung
affection
for
a
flown
spirit
forbade
him
to
check
it
the
flesh
was
absent
altogether
it
was
love
rarefied
and
refined
to
its
highest
attar
he
had
felt
nothing
like
it
before
the
next
afternoon
he
went
down
to
the
club
not
his
large
club
where
the
men
hardly
spoke
to
each
other
but
the
homely
one
where
they
told
stories
of
an
afternoon
and
were
not
ashamed
to
confess
among
themselves
to
personal
weaknesses
and
follies
knowing
well
that
such
secrets
would
go
no
further
but
he
could
not
tell
this
so
volatile
and
intangible
was
the
story
that
to
convey
it
in
words
would
have
been
as
hard
as
to
cage
a
perfume
they
observed
his
altered
manner
and
said
he
was
in
love
pierston
admitted
that
he
was
and
there
it
ended
when
he
reached
home
he
looked
out
of
his
bed
-
room
window
and
began
to
consider
in
what
direction
from
where
he
stood
that
darling
little
figure
lay
it
was
straight
across
there
under
the
young
pale
moon
the
symbol
signified
well
the
divinity
of
the
silver
bow
was
not
more
excellently
pure
than
she
the
lost
had
been
under
that
moon
was
the
island
of
ancient
slingers
and
on
the
island
a
house
framed
from
mullions
to
chimney
-
top
like
the
isle
itself
of
stone
inside
the
window
the
moonlight
irradiating
her
winding
-
sheet
lay
avice
reached
only
by
the
faint
noises
inherent
in
the
isle
the
tink
-
tink
of
the
chisels
in
the
quarries
the
surging
of
the
tides
in
the
bay
and
the
muffled
grumbling
of
the
currents
in
the
never
-
pacified
race
he
began
to
divine
the
truth
avice
the
departed
one
though
she
had
come
short
of
inspiring
a
passion
had
yet
possessed
a
ground
-
quality
absent
from
her
rivals
without
which
it
seemed
that
a
fixed
and
full
-
rounded
constancy
to
a
woman
could
not
flourish
in
him
like
his
own
her
family
had
been
islanders
for
centuries
from
norman
anglian
roman
balearic
-
british
times
hence
in
her
nature
as
in
his
was
some
mysterious
ingredient
sucked
from
the
isle
otherwise
a
racial
instinct
necessary
to
the
absolute
unison
of
a
pair
thus
though
he
might
never
love
a
woman
of
the
island
race
for
lack
in
her
of
the
desired
refinement
he
could
not
love
long
a
kimberlin
a
woman
other
than
of
the
island
race
for
her
lack
of
this
groundwork
of
character
such
was
pierston
'
s
view
of
things
another
fancy
of
his
an
artist
'
s
superstition
merely
may
be
mentioned
the
caros
like
some
other
local
families
suggested
a
roman
lineage
more
or
less
grafted
on
the
stock
of
the
slingers
their
features
recalled
those
of
the
italian
peasantry
to
