half
-
an
-
hour
later
bathsheba
,
in
finished
dress
,
and
followed
by
liddy
,
entered
the
upper
end
of
the
old
hall
to
find
that
her
men
had
all
deposited
themselves
on
a
long
form
and
a
settle
at
the
lower
extremity
.
she
sat
down
at
a
table
and
opened
the
time
-
book
,
pen
in
her
hand
,
with
a
canvas
money
-
bag
beside
her
.
from
this
she
poured
a
small
heap
of
coin
.
liddy
chose
a
position
at
her
elbow
and
began
to
sew
,
sometimes
pausing
and
looking
round
,
or
with
the
air
of
a
privileged
person
,
taking
up
one
of
the
half
-
sovereigns
lying
before
her
and
surveying
it
merely
as
a
work
of
art
,
while
strictly
preventing
her
countenance
from
expressing
any
wish
to
possess
it
as
money
.
now
before
i
begin
,
men
.
said
bathsheba
,
i
have
two
matters
to
speak
of
.
the
first
is
that
the
bailiff
is
dismissed
for
thieving
,
and
that
i
have
formed
a
resolution
to
have
no
bailiff
at
all
,
but
to
manage
everything
with
my
own
head
and
hands
.
the
men
breathed
an
audible
breath
of
amazement
.
the
next
matter
is
,
have
you
heard
anything
of
fanny
?
nothing
,
ma
'
am
.
have
you
done
anything
?
i
met
farmer
boldwood
.
said
jacob
smallbury
,
'
and
i
went
with
him
and
two
of
his
men
,
and
dragged
new
-
mill
pond
,
but
we
found
nothing
.
and
the
new
shepherd
have
been
to
buck
'
s
head
,
by
yalbury
,
thinking
she
had
gone
there
,
but
nobody
had
seed
her
.
said
laban
tall
.
has
not
william
smallbury
been
to
casterbridge
?
yes
,
ma
'
am
,
but
he
is
not
yet
come
home
.
he
promised
to
be
back
by
six
.
it
wants
a
quarter
to
six
at
present
.
said
bathsheba
,
looking
at
her
watch
.
i
daresay
he
will
be
in
directly
.
well
,
now
then
she
looked
into
the
book
joseph
poorgrass
,
are
you
there
?
yes
,
sir
ma
'
am
i
mane

said
the
person
addressed
.
i
be
the
personal
name
of
poorgrass
.
and
what
are
you
?
nothing
in
my
own
eye
.
in
the
eye
of
other
people
well
,
i
do
not
say
it
;
though
public
thought
will
out
.
what
do
you
do
on
the
farm
?
i
do
do
carting
things
all
the
year
,
and
in
seed
time
i
shoots
the
rooks
and
sparrows
,
and
helps

sir
.
how
much

?
please

and
ninepence
and
a
good
halfpenny
where
'
twas
a
bad
one
,
sir
ma
'
am
i
mane
.
quite
correct
.
now
here
are
ten
shillings
in
addition
as
a
small
present
,
as
i
am
a
new
comer
.
bathsheba
blushed
slightly
at
the
sense
of
being
generous
in
public
,
and
henery
fray
,
who
had
drawn
up
towards
her
chair
,
lifted
his
eyebrows
and
fingers
to
express
amazement
on
a
small
scale
.
how
much
do
i
owe
you
that
man
in
the
corner
what
'
s
your
name
?
continued
bathsheba
.
matthew
moon
,
ma
'
am
.
said
a
singular
framework
of
clothes
with
nothing
of
any
consequence
inside
them
,
which
advanced
with
the
toes
in
no
definite
direction
forwards
,
but
turned
in
or
out
as
they
chanced
to
swing
.
matthew
mark
,
did
you
say
?
speak

i
shall
not
hurt
you
.
inquired
the
young
farmer
,
kindly
.
matthew
moon

said
henery
fray
,
correctingly
,
from
behind
her
chair
,
to
which
point
he
had
edged
himself
.
matthew
moon
.
murmured
bathsheba
,
turning
her
bright
eyes
to
the
book
.
ten
and
twopence
halfpenny
is
the
sum
put
down
to
you
,
i
see
?
yes
,
mis
'
ess
.
said
matthew
,
as
the
rustle
of
wind
among
dead
leaves
.
here
it
is
and
ten
shillings

said
henery
fray
in
an
undertone
,
and
they
turned
him
away
because
the
only
time
he
ever
did
speak
plain
he
said
his
soul
was
his
own
,
and
other
iniquities
,
to
the
squire

was
echoed
in
shrill
unison
.
what
have
you
been
doing
?
tending
thrashing
-
machine
and
wimbling
haybonds
,
and
saying
hoosh
!
to
the
cocks
and
hens
when
they
go
upon

planting

.
yes
i
see
.
are

women

she
inquired
softly
of
henery
fray
.
o
mem
do
not
ask
me
!
yielding
women
?
as
scarlet
a
pair
as
ever
was
!
groaned
henery
under
his
breath
.
sit
down
.
who
,
mem
?
sit
down
,
joseph
poorgrass
,
in
the
background
twitched
,
and
his
lips
became
dry
with
fear
of
some
terrible
consequences
,
as
he
saw
bathsheba
summarily
speaking
,
and
henery
slinking
off
to
a
corner
.
now
the
next
.
laban
tall
,
you
will
stay
on
working
for
me
?
for
you
or
anybody
that
pays
me
well
,
ma
'
am
,
replied
the
young
married
man
.
true
the
man
must
live
!
said
a
woman
in
the
back
quarter
,
who
had
just
entered
with
clicking
pattens
.
what
woman
is
that
?
bathsheba
asked
.
i
be
his
lawful
wife
!
continued
the
voice
with
greater
prominence
of
manner
and
tone
.
this
lady
called
herself
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
looked
thirty
,
passed
as
thirty
-
five
,
and
was
forty
.
she
was
a
woman
who
never
,
like
some
newly
married
,
showed
conjugal
tenderness
in
public
,
perhaps
because
she
had
none
to
show
.
oh
,
you
are
.
said
bathsheba
.
well
,
laban
,
will
you
stay
on
?
yes
,
he
will
stay
,
ma
'
am
!
said
again
the
shrill
tongue
of
laban
'
s
lawful
wife
.
well
,
he
can
speak
for
himself
,
i
suppose
.
o
lord
,
not
he
,
ma
'
am
!
a
simple
tool
.
well
enough
,
but
a
poor
gawkhammer
mortal
.
the
wife
replied
heh
-
heh
-
heh
!
laughed
the
married
man
with
a
hideous
effort
of
appreciation
,
for
he
was
as
irrepressibly
good
-
humoured
under
ghastly
snubs
as
a
parliamentary
candidate
on
the
hustings
.
the
names
remaining
were
called
in
the
same
manner
.
now
i
think
i
have
done
with
you
.
said
bathsheba
,
closing
the
book
and
shaking
back
a
stray
twine
of
hair
.
has
william
smallbury
returned
?
no
,
ma
'
am
.
the
new
shepherd
will
want
a
man
under
him
,
suggested
henery
fray
,
trying
to
make
himself
official
again
by
a
sideway
approach
towards
her
chair
.
oh
he
will
.
who
can
he
have
?
young
cain
ball
is
a
very
good
lad
.
henery
said
,
and
shepherd
oak
do
not
mind
his
youth
?
he
added
,
turning
with
an
apologetic
smile
to
the
shepherd
,
who
had
just
appeared
on
the
scene
,
and
was
now
leaning
against
the
doorpost
with
his
arms
folded
.
no
,
i
do
not
mind
that
.
said
gabriel
.
how
did
cain
come
by
such
a
name
?
asked
bathsheba
.
oh
you
see
,
mem
,
his
pore
mother
,
not
being
a
scripture
-
read
woman
made
a
mistake
at
his
christening
,
thinking
'
twas
abel
killed
cain
,
and
called
en
cain
,
but
'
twas
too
late
,
for
the
name
could
never
be
got
rid
of
in
the
parish
.
'
tis
very
unfortunate
for
the
boy
.
it
is
rather
unfortunate
.
yes
.
however
,
we
soften
it
down
as
much
as
we
can
,
and
call
him
cainey
.
ah
,
pore
widow
-
woman
!
she
cried
her
heart
out
about
it
almost
.
she
was
brought
up
by
a
very
heathen
father
and
mother
,
who
never
sent
her
to
church
or
school
,
and
it
shows
how
the
sins
of
the
parents
are
visited
upon
the
children
,
mem
.
mr
fray
here
drew
up
his
features
to
the
mild
degree
of
melancholy
required
when
the
persons
involved
in
the
given
misfortune
do
not
belong
to
your
own
family
.
very
well
then
,
cainey
ball
to
be
under
-
shepherd
and
you
quite
understand
your
duties
?
you
i
mean
,
gabriel
oak
?
quite
well
,
i
thank
you
miss
everdene
.
said
shepard
oak
from
the
doorpost
.
if
i
don
'
t
,
i
will
inquire
.
gabriel
was
rather
staggered
by
the
remark
-
able
coolness
of
her
manner
.
certainly
nobody
without
previous
information
would
have
dreamt
that
oak
and
the
handsome
woman
before
whom
he
stood
had
ever
been
other
than
strangers
.
but
perhaps
her
air
was
the
inevitable
result
of
the
social
rise
which
had
advanced
her
from
a
cottage
to
a
large
house
and
fields
.
the
case
is
not
unexampled
in
high
places
.
when
,
in
the
writings
of
the
later
poets
,
jove
and
his
family
are
found
to
have
moved
from
their
cramped
quarters
on
the
peak
of
olympus
into
the
wide
sky
above
it
,
their
words
show
a
proportionate
increase
of
arrogance
and
reserve
.
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
passage
,
combining
in
their
character
the
qualities
both
of
weight
and
measure
,
rather
at
the
expense
of
velocity
.
here
'
s
billy
smallbury
come
from
caster
-
bridge
.
and
what
'
s
the
news
?
said
bathsheba
,
as
william
,
after
marching
to
the
middle
of
the
hall
,
took
a
hand
-
kerchief
from
his
hat
and
wiped
his
forehead
from
its
centre
to
its
remoter
boundaries
.
i
should
have
been
sooner
,
miss
.
he
said
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
weather
.
he
then
stamped
with
each
foot
severely
,
and
on
looking
down
his
boots
were
perceived
to
be
clogged
with
snow
.
come
at
last
,
is
it
?
said
henery
.
well
,
what
about
fanny
?
said
bathsheba
.
well
,
ma
'
am
,
in
round
numbers
,
she
is
run
away
with
the
soldiers
.
said
william
.
no
;
not
a
steady
girl
like
fanny
!
i
will
tell
ye
all
particulars
.
when
i
got
to
caster
,
bridge
barracks
,
they
said
,
the
eleventh
dragoon
-
guards
be
gone
away
,
and
new
troops
have
come
.
the
eleventh
left
last
week
for
melchester
and
onwards
.
the
route
came
from
government
like
a
thief
in
the
night
,
as
is
his
nature
to
,
and
afore
the
eleventh
knew
it
almost
,
they
were
on
the
march
.
they
passed
near
here
.
gabriel
had
listened
with
interest
.
i
saw
them
go
,
he
said
.
yes
.
continued
william
,
they
pranced
down
the
street
playing
the
girl
i
left
behind
me
.
so
'
tis
said
,
in
glorious
notes
of
triumph
.
every
looker
-
on
'
s
inside
shook
with
the
blows
of
the
great
drum
to
his
deepest
vitals
,
and
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
throughout
the
town
among
the
public
-
house
people
and
the
name
-
less
women
!
but
they
are
not
gone
to
any
war
?
no
,
ma
'
am
;
but
they
be
gone
to
take
the
places
of
them
who
may
,
which
is
very
close
connected
.
and
so
i
said
to
myself
,
fanny
'
s
young
man
was
one
of
the
regiment
,
and
she
is
gone
after
him
.
there
,
ma
'
am
,
that
'
s
it
in
black
and
white
.
gabriel
remained
musing
and
said
nothing
,
for
he
was
in
doubt
.
well
,
we
are
not
likely
to
know
more
to
-
night
,
at
any
rate
.
said
bathsheba
.
but
one
of
you
had
better
run
across
to
farmer
boldwood
'
s
and
tell
him
that
much
.
she
then
rose
;
but
before
retiring
,
addressed
a
few
words
to
them
with
a
pretty
dignity
,
to
which
her
mourning
dress
added
a
soberness
that
was
hardly
to
be
found
in
the
words
themselves
.
now
mind
,
you
have
a
mistress
instead
of
a
master
i
do
not
yet
know
my
powers
or
my
talents
in
farming
;
but
i
shall
do
my
best
,
and
if
you
serve
me
well
,
so
shall
i
serve
you
.
do
not
any
unfair
ones
among
you
(
if
there
are
any
such
,
but
i
hope
not
)
suppose
that
because
i
am
a
woman
i
do
not
understand
the
difference
between
bad
goings
-
on
and
good
.
(
all
.
)
nom
!
(
liddy
.
)
excellent
well
said
.
i
shall
be
up
before
you
are
awake
;
i
shall
be
afield
before
you
are
up
;
and
i
shall
have
breakfasted
before
you
are
afield
.
in
short
,
i
shall
astonish
you
all
.
(
all
.
)
yes
'
m
!
and
so
good
-
night
.
(
all
.
)
good
-
night
,
ma
'
am
.
then
this
small
thesmothete
stepped
from
the
table
,
and
surged
out
of
the
hall
,
her
black
silk
dress
licking
up
a
few
straws
and
dragging
them
along
with
a
scratch
-
ing
noise
upon
the
floor
.
biddy
,
elevating
her
feelings
to
the
occasion
from
a
sense
of
grandeur
,
floated
off
behind
bathsheba
with
a
milder
dignity
not
entirely
free
from
travesty
,
and
the
door
was
closed
.
for
dreariness
nothing
could
surpass
a
prospect
in
the
outskirts
of
a
certain
town
and
military
station
,
many
miles
north
of
weatherbury
,
at
a
later
hour
on
this
same
snowy
evening
if
that
may
be
called
a
prospect
of
which
the
chief
constituent
was
darkness
.
it
was
a
night
when
sorrow
may
come
to
the
brightest
without
causing
any
great
sense
of
incongruity
:
when
,
with
impressible
persons
,
love
becomes
solicitous
-
ness
,
hope
sinks
to
misgiving
,
and
faith
to
hope
:
when
the
exercise
of
memory
does
not
stir
feelings
of
regret
at
opportunities
for
ambition
that
have
been
passed
by
,
and
anticipation
does
not
prompt
to
enterprise
.
the
scene
was
a
public
path
,
bordered
on
the
left
hand
by
a
river
,
behind
which
rose
a
high
wall
.
on
the
right
was
a
tract
of
land
,
partly
meadow
and
partly
moor
,
reaching
,
at
its
remote
verge
,
to
a
wide
undulating
uplan
.
the
changes
of
the
seasons
are
less
obtrusive
on
spots
of
this
kind
than
amid
woodland
scenery
.
still
,
to
a
close
observer
,
they
are
just
as
perceptible
;
the
difference
is
that
their
media
of
manifestation
are
less
trite
and
familiar
than
such
well
-
known
ones
as
the
bursting
of
the
buds
or
the
fall
of
the
leaf
.
many
are
not
so
stealthy
and
gradual
as
we
may
be
apt
to
imagine
in
considering
the
general
torpidity
of
a
moor
or
waste
.
winter
,
in
coming
to
the
country
hereabout
,
advanced
in
well
-
marked
stages
,
wherein
might
have
been
successively
observed
the
retreat
of
the
snakes
,
the
transformation
of
the
ferns
,
the
filling
of
the
pools
,
a
rising
of
fogs
,
the
embrowning
by
frost
,
the
collapse
of
the
fungi
,
and
an
obliteration
by
snow
.
this
climax
of
the
series
had
been
reached
to
-
night
on
the
aforesaid
moor
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
the
season
its
irregularities
were
forms
without
features
;
suggestive
of
anything
,
proclaiming
nothing
,
and
without
more
character
than
that
of
being
the
limit
of
something
else
the
lowest
layer
of
a
firmament
of
snow
.
from
this
chaotic
skyful
of
crowding
flakes
the
mead
and
moor
momentarily
received
additional
clothing
,
only
to
appear
momentarily
more
naked
thereby
.
the
vast
arch
of
cloud
above
was
strangely
low
,
and
formed
as
it
were
the
roof
of
a
large
dark
cavern
,
gradually
sinking
in
upon
its
floor
;
for
the
instinctive
thought
was
that
the
snow
lining
the
heavens
and
that
encrusting
the
earth
would
soon
unite
into
one
mass
without
any
intervening
stratum
of
air
at
all
.
we
turn
our
attention
to
the
left
-
hand
characteristics
;
which
were
flatness
in
respect
of
the
river
,
verticality
in
respect
of
the
wall
behind
it
,
and
darkness
as
to
both
.
these
features
made
up
the
mass
.
if
anything
could
be
darker
than
the
sky
,
it
was
the
wall
,
and
if
any
thing
could
be
gloomier
than
the
wall
it
was
the
river
beneath
.
the
indistinct
summit
of
the
facade
was
notched
and
pronged
by
chimneys
here
and
there
,
and
upon
its
face
were
faintly
signified
the
oblong
shapes
of
windows
,
though
only
in
the
upper
part
.
below
,
down
to
the
water
'
s
edge
,
the
flat
was
unbroken
by
hole
or
projection
.
an
indescribable
succession
of
dull
blows
,
perplexing
in
their
regularity
,
sent
their
sound
-
with
difficulty
through
the
fluffy
atmosphere
.
it
was
a
neighbouring
clock
striking
ten
the
bell
was
in
the
open
air
,
and
being
overlaid
with
several
inches
of
muffling
snow
,
had
lost
its
voice
for
the
time
.
about
this
hour
the
snow
abated
:
ten
flakes
fell
where
twenty
had
fallen
,
then
one
had
the
room
of
ten
.
not
long
after
a
form
moved
by
the
brink
of
the
river
.
by
its
outline
upon
the
colourless
background
,
a
close
observer
might
have
seen
that
it
was
small
.
this
was
all
that
was
positively
discoverable
,
though
it
seemed
human
.
the
shape
went
slowly
along
,
but
without
much
exertion
,
for
the
snow
,
though
sudden
,
was
not
as
yet
more
than
two
inches
deep
.
at
this
time
some
words
were
spoken
aloud
:
one
.
two
.
three
.
four
.
five
.
between
each
utterance
the
little
shape
advanced
about
half
a
dozen
yards
.
it
was
evident
now
that
the
windows
high
in
the
wall
were
being
counted
.
the
word
five
represented
the
fifth
window
from
the
end
of
the
wall
.
here
the
spot
stopped
,
and
dwindled
smaller
.
the
figure
was
stooping
.
then
a
morsel
of
snow
flew
across
the
river
towards
the
fifth
window
.
it
smacked
against
the
wall
at
a
point
several
yards
from
its
mark
.
the
throw
was
the
idea
of
a
man
conjoined
with
the
execution
of
a
woman
.
no
man
who
had
ever
seen
bird
,
rabbit
,
or
squirrel
in
his
childhood
,
could
possibly
have
thrown
with
such
utter
imbecility
as
was
shown
here
.
another
attempt
,
and
another
;
till
by
degrees
the
wall
must
have
become
pimpled
with
the
adhering
lumps
of
snow
at
last
one
fragment
struck
the
fifth
window
.
the
river
would
have
been
;
seen
by
day
to
be
of
that
deep
smooth
sort
which
races
middle
and
sides
with
the
same
gliding
precision
,
any
irregularities
of
speed
being
immediately
corrected
by
a
small
whirl
-
pool
.
nothing
was
heard
in
reply
to
the
signal
but
the
gurgle
and
cluck
of
one
of
these
invisible
wheels
together
with
a
few
small
sounds
which
a
sad
man
would
have
called
moans
,
and
a
happy
man
laughter
caused
by
the
flapping
of
the
waters
against
trifling
objects
in
other
parts
of
the
stream
.
the
window
was
struck
again
in
the
same
manner
.
then
a
noise
was
heard
,
apparently
produced
by
the
opening
of
the
window
.
this
was
followed
by
a
voice
from
the
same
quarter
.
who
'
s
there
?
the
tones
were
masculine
,
and
not
those
of
surprise
.
the
high
wall
being
that
of
a
barrack
,
and
marriage
being
looked
upon
with
disfavour
in
the
army
,
assignations
and
communications
had
probably
been
made
across
the
river
before
tonight
.
is
it
sergeant
troy
?
said
the
blurred
spot
in
the
snow
,
tremulously
.
this
person
was
so
much
like
a
mere
shade
upon
the
earth
,
and
the
other
speaker
so
much
a
part
of
the
building
,
that
one
would
have
said
the
wall
was
holding
a
conversation
with
the
snow
.
yes
.
came
suspiciously
from
the
shadow
.
what
girl
are
you
?
o
,
frank
do
not
you
know
me
?
said
the
spot
.
your
wife
,
fanny
robin
.
fanny
!
said
the
wall
,
in
utter
astonishment
.
yes
.
said
the
girl
,
with
a
half
-
suppressed
gasp
of
emotion
.
there
was
something
in
the
woman
'
s
tone
which
is
not
that
of
the
wife
,
and
there
was
a
mannerin
the
man
which
is
rarely
a
husband
'
s
.
the
dialogue
went
on
:
how
did
you
come
here
?
i
asked
which
was
your
window
.
forgive
me
!
i
did
not
expect
you
to
-
night
.
indeed
,
i
did
not
think
you
would
come
at
all
.
it
was
a
wonder
you
found
me
here
.
i
am
orderly
to
-
morrow
.
you
said
i
was
to
come
.
well
i
said
that
you
might
.
yes
,
i
mean
that
i
might
.
you
are
glad
to
see
me
,
frank
?
o
yes
of
course
.
can
you
come
to
me
!
my
dear
fan
,
no
!
the
bugle
has
sounded
,
the
barrack
gates
are
closed
,
and
i
have
no
leave
.
we
are
all
of
us
as
good
as
in
the
county
gaol
till
to
-
morrow
morning
.
then
i
sha
not
see
you
till
then
!
the
words
were
in
a
faltering
tone
of
disappointment
.
how
did
you
get
here
from
weatherbury
?
i
walked
some
part
of
the
way
the
rest
by
the
carriers
.
i
am
surprised
.
yes
so
am
i
.
and
frank
,
when
will
it
be
?
what
?
that
you
promised
.
i
do
not
quite
recollect
.
o
you
do
!
do
not
speak
like
that
.
it
weighs
me
to
the
earth
.
it
makes
me
say
what
ought
to
be
said
first
by
you
.
never
mind
say
it
.
o
,
must
i
?
it
is
,
when
shall
we
be
married
,
frank
?
oh
,
i
see
.
well
you
have
to
get
proper
clothes
.
i
have
money
.
will
it
be
by
banns
or
license
?
banns
,
i
should
think
.
and
we
live
in
two
parishes
.
do
we
?
what
then
?
my
lodgings
are
in
st
.
mary
'
s
,
and
this
is
not
.
so
they
will
have
to
be
published
in
both
.
is
that
the
law
?
yes
.
o
frank
you
think
me
forward
,
i
am
afraid
!
don
'
t
,
dear
frank
will
you
for
i
love
you
so
.
and
you
said
lots
of
times
you
would
marry
me
,
and
and
i
i
i
do
not
cry
,
now
!
it
is
foolish
.
if
i
said
so
,
of
course
i
will
.
and
shall
i
put
up
the
banns
in
my
parish
,
and
will
you
in

i

,
so
.

,
my
dean
good
-
night
.
good
-
night
,
frank
good
-
night
!
and
the
noise
was
again
heard
of
a
window
closing
the
little
spot
moved
away
.
when
she
passed
the
corner
a
subdued
exclamation
was
heard
inside
the
wall
.
ho
ho
sergeant
ho
ho
!
an
expostulation
followed
,
but
it
was
indistinct
;
and
it
became
lost
amid
a
low
peal
of
laughter
,
which
was
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
gurgle
of
the
tiny
whirlpools
outside
.
the
first
public
evidence
of
bathsheba
'
s
decision
to
be
a
farmer
in
her
own
person
and
by
proxy
no
more
was
her
appearance
the
following
market
-
day
in
.
the
cornmarket
at
casterbridge
.
the
low
though
extensive
hall
,
supported
by
beams
and
pillars
,
and
latterly
dignified
by
-
the
name
of
corn
exchange
,
was
thronged
with
hot
men
who
talked
among
each
other
in
twos
and
threes
,
the
speaker
of
the
minute
looking
sideways
into
his
auditor
'
s
face
and
concentrating
his
argument
by
a
contraction
of
one
eyelid
during
de
-
livery
.
the
greater
number
carried
in
their
hands
ground
-
ash
saplings
,
using
them
partly
as
walking
-
sticks
and
partly
for
poking
up
pigs
,
sheep
,
neighbours
with
their
backs
turned
,
and
restful
things
in
general
,
which
seemed
to
require
such
treatment
in
the
course
of
their
peregrinations
.
during
conversations
each
subjected
his
sapling
to
great
varieties
of
usage
bending
it
round
his
back
,
forming
an
arch
of
it
between
his
two
hands
,
overweighting
it
on
the
ground
till
it
reached
nearly
a
semicircle
;
or
perhaps
it
was
hastily
tucked
under
the
arm
whilst
the
sample
-
bag
was
pulled
forth
and
a
handful
of
corn
poured
into
the
palm
,
which
,
after
criticism
,
was
flung
upon
the
floor
,
an
issue
of
events
perfectly
well
known
to
half
-
a
-
dozen
acute
town
-
bred
fowls
which
had
as
usual
crept
into
the
building
unobserved
,
and
waited
the
fulfilment
of
their
anticipations
with
a
high
-
stretched
neck
and
oblique
eye
.
among
these
heavy
yeomen
a
feminine
figure
glided
,
the
single
one
of
her
sex
that
the
room
contained
.
she
was
prettily
and
even
daintily
dressed
.
she
moved
between
them
as
a
chaise
between
carts
,
was
heard
after
them
as
a
romance
after
sermons
,
was
felt
among
them
like
a
breeze
among
furnaces
.
it
had
required
a
little
determination
far
more
than
she
had
at
first
imagined
to
take
up
a
position
here
,
for
at
her
first
entry
the
lumbering
dialogues
had
ceased
,
nearly
every
face
had
been
turned
towards
her
,
and
those
that
were
already
turned
rigidly
fixed
there
.
two
or
three
only
of
the
farmers
were
personally
known
to
bathsheba
,
and
to
these
she
had
made
her
way
.
but
if
she
was
to
be
the
practical
woman
she
had
intended
to
show
herself
,
business
must
be
carried
on
,
introductions
or
none
,
and
she
ultimately
acquired
confidence
enough
to
speak
and
reply
boldly
to
men
merely
known
to
her
by
hearsay
.
bathsheba
too
had
her
sample
-
bags
,
and
by
degrees
adopted
the
professional
pour
into
the
hand
holding
up
the
grains
in
her
narrow
palm
for
inspection
,
in
perfect
casterbridge
manner
.
something
in
the
exact
arch
of
her
upper
unbroken
row
of
teeth
,
and
in
the
keenly
pointed
corners
of
her
red
mouth
when
,
with
parted
lips
,
she
somewhat
defiantly
turned
up
her
face
to
argue
a
point
with
a
tall
man
,
suggested
that
there
was
potentiality
enough
in
that
lithe
slip
of
humanity
for
alarming
exploits
of
sex
,
and
daring
enough
to
carry
them
out
.
but
her
eyes
had
a
softness
invariably
a
softness
which
,
had
they
not
been
dark
,
would
have
seemed
mistiness
;
as
they
were
,
it
lowered
an
expression
that
might
have
been
piercing
to
simple
clearness
,
strange
to
say
of
a
woman
in
full
bloom
and
vigor
,
she
always
allowed
her
interlocutors
to
finish
their
state
-
ments
before
rejoining
with
hers
.
in
arguing
on
prices
,
he
held
to
her
own
firmly
,
as
was
natural
in
a
dealer
,
and
reduced
theirs
persistently
,
as
was
inevitable
in
a
oman
.
but
there
was
an
elasticity
in
her
firmness
which
removed
it
from
obstinacy
,
as
there
was
a
naivete
in
her
cheapening
which
saved
it
from
meanness
.
those
of
the
farmers
with
whom
she
had
no
dealings
by
far
the
greater
part
)
were
continually
asking
each
other
,
who
is
she
?
the
reply
would
be
farmer
everdene
'
s
niece
;
took
on
weatherbury
upper
farm
;
turned
away
the
baily
,
and
swears
she
will
do
everything
herself
.
the
other
man
would
then
shake
his
head
.
yes
,
'
tis
a
pity
she
is
so
headstrong
.
the
first
would
say
.
but
we
ought
to
be
proud
of
her
here
she
lightens
up
the
old
place
.
'
tis
such
a
shapely
maid
,
however
,
that
she
will
soon
get
picked
up
.
it
would
be
ungallant
to
suggest
that
the
novelty
of
her
engagement
in
such
an
occupation
had
almost
as
much
to
do
with
the
magnetism
as
had
the
beauty
of
her
face
and
movements
.
however
,
the
interest
was
general
,
and
this
saturday
'
s
debut
in
the
forum
,
whatever
it
may
have
been
to
bathsheba
as
the
buying
and
selling
farmer
,
was
unquestionably
a
triumph
to
her
as
the
maiden
.
indeed
,
the
sensation
was
so
pronounced
that
her
instinct
on
two
or
three
occasions
was
merely
to
walk
as
a
queen
among
these
gods
of
the
fallow
,
like
a
little
sister
of
a
little
jove
,
and
to
neglect
closing
prices
altogether
.
the
numerous
evidences
of
-
her
power
to
attract
were
only
thrown
into
greater
relief
by
a
marked
exception
.
women
seem
to
have
eyes
in
their
ribbons
for
such
matters
as
these
.
bathsheba
,
without
looking
within
a
right
angle
of
him
,
was
conscious
of
a
black
sheep
among
the
flock
.
it
perplexed
her
first
.
if
there
had
been
a
respect
-
able
minority
on
either
side
,
the
case
would
have
been
most
natural
.
if
nobody
had
regarded
her
,
she
would
have
taken
the
matter
indifferently
such
cases
had
occurred
.
if
everybody
,
this
man
included
,
she
would
have
taken
it
as
a
matter
of
course
people
had
done
so
before
.
but
the
smallness
of
the
exception
made
the
mystery
.
she
soon
knew
thus
much
of
the
recusant
'
s
appearance
.
he
was
a
gentlemanly
man
,
with
full
and
distinctly
outlined
roman
features
,
the
prominences
of
which
glowed
in
the
sun
with
a
bronze
-
like
richness
of
tone
.
he
was
erect
in
attitude
,
and
quiet
in
demeanour
.
one
characteristic
pre
-
eminently
marked
him
dignity
.
apparently
he
had
some
time
ago
reached
that
entrance
to
middle
age
at
which
a
man
'
s
aspect
naturally
ceases
to
alter
for
the
term
of
a
dozen
years
or
so
;
and
,
artificially
,
a
woman
'
s
does
likewise
.
thirty
-
five
and
fifty
were
his
limits
of
variation
he
might
have
been
either
,
or
anywhere
between
the
two
.
it
may
be
said
that
married
men
of
forty
are
usually
ready
and
generous
enough
to
fling
passing
glances
at
any
specimen
of
moderate
beauty
they
may
discern
by
the
way
.
probably
,
as
with
persons
playing
whist
for
love
,
the
consciousness
of
a
certain
immunity
under
any
circumstances
from
that
worst
possible
ultimate
,
the
having
to
pay
,
makes
them
unduly
speculative
.
bathsheba
was
convinced
that
this
unmoved
person
was
not
a
married
man
.
when
marketing
was
over
,
she
rushed
off
to
liddy
,
who
was
waiting
for
her
beside
the
yellowing
in
which
they
had
driven
to
town
.
the
horse
was
put
in
,
and
on
they
trotted
bathsheba
'
s
sugar
,
tea
,
and
drapery
parcels
being
packed
behind
,
and
expressing
in
some
indescribable
manner
,
by
their
colour
,
shape
,
and
general
lineaments
,
that
they
were
that
young
lady
-
farmer
'
s
property
,
and
the
grocer
'
s
and
drapers
no
more
.
i
'
ve
been
through
it
,
liddy
,
and
it
is
over
.
i
sha
not
mind
it
again
,
for
they
will
all
have
grown
accustomed
to
seeing
me
there
;
but
this
morning
it
was
as
bad
as
being
married
eyes
everywhere
!
i
knowed
it
would
.
be
.
liddy
said
men
be
such
a
terrible
class
of
society
to
look
at
a
body
.
but
there
was
one
man
who
had
more
sense
than
to
waste
his
time
upon
me
.
the
information
was
put
in
this
form
that
liddy
might
not
for
a
moment
suppose
her
mistress
was
at
all
piqued
.
a
very
good
-
looking
man
.
she
continued
,
upright
;
about
forty
,
i
should
think
.
do
you
know
at
all
who
he
could
be
?
liddy
could
not
think
.
ca
not
you
guess
at
all
?
said
bathsheba
with
some
disappointment
.
i
have
not
a
notion
;
besides
,
'
tis
no
difference
,
since
he
took
less
notice
of
you
than
any
of
the
rest
.
now
,
if
he
'
d
taken
more
,
it
would
have
mattered
a
great
deal
.
bathsheba
was
suffering
from
the
reverse
feeling
just
then
,
and
they
bowled
along
in
silence
.
a
low
carriage
,
bowling
along
still
more
rapidly
behind
a
horse
of
un
-
impeachable
breed
,
overtook
and
passed
them
.
why
,
there
he
is
!
she
said
.
liddy
looked
.
that
!
that
'
s
farmer
boldwood
of
course
'
tis
the
man
you
could
not
see
the
other
day
when
he
called
.
oh
,
farmer
boldwood
.
murmured
bathsheba
,
and
looked
at
him
as
he
outstripped
them
.
the
farmer
had
never
turned
his
head
once
,
but
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
most
advanced
point
along
the
road
,
passed
as
uncon
-
sciously
and
abstractedly
as
if
bathsheba
and
her
charms
were
thin
air
.
he
is
an
interesting
man
do
not
you
think
so
?
she
remarked
.
o
yes
,
very
.
everybody
owns
it
.
replied
liddy
.
i
wonder
why
he
is
so
wrapt
up
and
indifferent
,
and
seemingly
so
far
away
from
all
he
sees
around
him
,
it
is
said
but
not
known
for
certain
that
he
met
with
some
bitter
disappointment
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
merry
.
a
woman
jilted
him
,
they
say
.
people
always
say
that
and
we
know
very
well
women
scarcely
ever
jilt
men
;
'
tis
the
men
who
jilt
us
.
i
expect
it
is
simply
his
nature
to
be
so
reserved
.
simply
his
nature
i
expect
so
,
miss
nothing
else
in
the
world
.
still
,
'
tis
more
romantic
to
think
he
has
been
served
cruelly
,
poor
thing
'
!
perhaps
,
after
all
,
he
has
!
i
depend
upon
it
he
has
.
o
yes
,
miss
,
he
has
!
feel
he
must
have
.
however
,
we
are
very
apt
to
think
extremes
of
people
.
i
should
not
wonder
after
all
if
it
was
not
a
little
of
both
just
between
the
two
rather
cruelly
used
and
rather
reserved
.
o
dear
no
,
miss
i
ca
not
think
it
between
the
two
!
that
'
s
most
likely
.
well
,
yes
,
so
it
is
.
i
am
convinced
it
is
most
likely
.
you
may
take
my
word
,
miss
,
that
that
'
s
what
'
s
the
matter
with
him
.
it
was
sunday
afternoon
in
the
farmhouse
,
on
the
thirteenth
of
february
.
dinner
being
over
,
bathsheba
,
for
want
of
a
better
companion
,
had
asked
liddy
to
come
and
sit
with
her
.
the
mouldy
pile
was
dreary
in
winter
-
time
before
the
candles
were
lighted
and
the
shutters
closed
;
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
seemed
as
old
as
the
walls
;
every
nook
behind
the
furniture
had
a
temperature
of
its
own
,
for
the
fire
was
not
kindled
in
this
part
of
the
house
early
in
the
day
;
and
bathsheba
'
s
new
piano
,
which
was
an
old
one
in
other
annals
,
looked
particularly
sloping
and
out
of
level
on
the
warped
floor
before
night
threw
a
shade
over
its
less
prominent
angles
and
hid
the
unpleasantness
.
liddy
,
like
a
little
brook
,
though
shallow
,
was
always
rippling
;
her
presence
had
not
so
much
weight
as
to
task
thought
,
and
yet
enough
to
exercise
it
.
on
the
table
lay
an
old
quarto
bible
,
bound
in
leather
.
liddy
looking
at
it
said
,
did
you
ever
find
out
,
miss
,
who
you
are
going
to
marry
by
means
of
the
bible
and
key
?
,
do
not
be
so
foolish
,
liddy
.
as
if
such
things
could
be
.
well
,
there
'
s
a
good
deal
in
it
,
all
the
same
.
nonsense
,
child
.
and
it
makes
your
heart
beat
fearful
.
some
believe
in
it
;
some
don
'
t
;
i
do
.
very
well
,
let
'
s
try
it
.
said
bathsheba
,
bounding
from
her
seat
with
that
total
disregard
of
consistency
which
can
be
indulged
in
towards
a
dependent
,
and
entering
into
the
spirit
of
divination
at
once
.
go
and
get
the
front
door
key
.
liddy
fetched
it
.
i
wish
it
was
not
sunday
.
she
said
,
on
returning
.
perhaps
'
tis
wrong
.
what
'
s
right
week
days
is
right
sundays
.
replied
her
mistress
in
a
tone
which
was
a
proof
in
itself
.
the
book
was
opened
the
leaves
,
drab
with
age
,
being
quite
worn
away
at
much
-
read
verses
by
the
fore
fingers
of
unpractised
readers
in
former
days
,
where
they
were
moved
along
under
the
line
as
an
aid
to
the
vision
.
the
special
verse
in
the
book
of
ruth
was
sought
out
by
bathsheba
,
and
the
sublime
words
met
her
eye
.
they
slightly
thrilled
and
abashed
her
.
it
was
wisdom
in
the
abstract
facing
folly
in
the
concrete
.
folly
in
the
concrete
blushed
,
persisted
in
her
intention
,
and
placed
the
key
on
-
the
book
.
a
rusty
patch
immediately
upon
the
verse
,
caused
by
previous
pressure
of
an
iron
substance
thereon
,
told
that
this
was
not
the
first
time
the
old
volume
had
been
used
for
the
purpose
.
now
keep
steady
,
and
be
silent
.
said
bathsheba
.
the
'
verse
was
repeated
;
the
book
turned
round
;
bathsheba
blushed
guiltily
.
who
did
you
try
?
said
liddy
curiously
.
i
shall
not
tell
you
.
did
you
notice
mr
boldwood
'
s
doings
in
church
this
morning
,
miss
?
liddy
continued
,
adumbrating
by
the
remark
the
track
her
thoughts
had
taken
.
no
,
indeed
.
said
bathsheba
,
with
serene
indifference
his
pew
is
exactly
opposite
yours
,
miss
.
i
know
it
.
and
you
did
not
see
his
goings
on
!
,
certainly
i
did
not
,
i
tell
you
.
liddy
assumed
a
smaller
physiognomy
,
and
shut
her
lips
decisively
.
this
move
was
unexpected
,
and
proportionately
disconcerting
.
what
did
he
do
?
bathsheba
said
perforce
.
did
not
turn
his
head
to
look
at
you
once
all
the
service
.
why
should
he
?
again
demanded
her
mistress
,
wearing
a
nettled
look
.
i
did
not
ask
him
to
.
oh
no
.
but
everybody
else
was
noticing
you
;
and
it
was
odd
he
didn
'
t
.
there
,
'
tis
like
him
.
rich
and
gentlemanly
,
what
does
he
care
?
bathsheba
dropped
into
a
silence
intended
to
express
that
she
had
opinions
on
the
matter
too
abstruse
for
liddy
'
s
comprehension
,
rather
than
that
she
had
nothing
to
say
.
dear
me
i
had
nearly
forgotten
the
valentine
i
bought
yesterday
.
she
exclaimed
at
length
.
valentine
!
who
for
,
miss
?
said
liddy
.
farmer
boldwood
?
it
was
the
single
name
among
all
possible
wrong
ones
that
just
at
this
moment
seemed
to
bathsheba
more
pertinent
than
the
right
.
well
,
no
.
it
is
only
for
little
teddy
coggan
.
have
promised
him
something
,
and
this
will
be
a
pretty
surprise
for
him
.
liddy
,
you
may
as
well
bring
me
my
desk
and
i
will
direct
it
at
once
.
bathsheba
took
from
her
desk
a
gorgeously
illuminated
and
embossed
design
in
post
-
octavo
,
which
had
been
bought
on
the
previous
market
-
day
at
the
chief
stationer
'
s
in
casterbridge
.
in
the
centre
was
a
small
oval
enclosure
;
this
was
left
blank
,
that
the
sender
might
insert
tender
words
more
appropriate
to
the
special
occasion
than
any
generalities
by
a
printer
could
possibly
be
.
here
'
s
a
place
for
writing
.
said
bathsheba
.
what
shall
i
put
?
something
of
this
sort
,
i
should
think
'
,
returned
liddy
promptly
:
the
rose
is
red
,
the
violet
blue
,
carnation
'
s
sweet
,
and
so
are
you
.
yes
,
that
shall
be
it
.
it
just
suits
itself
to
a
chubby
-
faced
child
like
him
.
said
bathsheba
.
she
inserted
the
words
in
a
small
though
legible
handwriting
;
enclosed
the
sheet
in
an
envelope
,
and
dipped
her
pen
for
the
direction
.
what
fun
it
would
be
to
send
it
to
the
stupid
old
boldwood
,
and
how
he
would
wonder
!
said
the
irrepressible
liddy
,
lifting
her
eyebrows
,
and
indulging
in
an
awful
mirth
on
the
verge
of
fear
as
she
thought
of
the
moral
and
social
magnitude
of
the
man
contem
-
plated
.
bathsheba
paused
to
regard
the
idea
at
full
length
.
boldwood
'
s
had
begun
to
be
a
troublesome
image
a
species
of
daniel
in
her
kingdom
who
persisted
in
kneeling
eastward
when
reason
and
common
sense
said
that
he
might
just
as
well
follow
suit
with
the
rest
,
and
afford
her
the
official
glance
of
admiration
which
cost
nothing
at
all
.
she
was
far
from
being
seriously
concerned
about
his
nonconformity
.
still
,
it
was
faintly
depressing
that
the
most
dignified
and
valuable
man
in
the
parish
should
withhold
his
eyes
,
and
that
a
girl
like
liddy
should
talk
about
it
.
so
liddy
'
s
idea
was
at
first
rather
harassing
than
piquant
.
no
,
i
wo
not
do
that
.
he
would
not
see
any
humour
in
it
.
he
'
d
worry
to
death
.
said
the
persistent
liddy
.
really
,
i
do
not
care
particularly
to
send
it
to
teddy
.
remarked
her
mistress
.
he
is
rather
a
naughty
child
sometimes
.
yes
that
he
is
.
let
'
s
toss
as
men
do
.
said
bathsheba
,
idly
.
now
then
,
head
,
boldwood
;
tail
,
teddy
.
no
,
we
wo
not
toss
money
on
a
sunday
that
would
be
tempting
the
devil
indeed
.
toss
this
hymn
-
book
;
there
ca
not
be
no
sinfulness
in
that
,
miss
.
very
well
.
open
,
boldwood
shut
,
teddy
.
no
;
it
is
more
likely
to
fall
open
.
open
,
teddy
shut
,
boldwood
.
the
book
went
fluttering
in
the
air
and
came
down
shut
.
bathsheba
,
a
small
yawn
upon
her
mouth
,
took
the
pen
,
and
with
off
-
hand
serenity
directed
the
missive
to
boldwood
.
now
light
a
candle
,
liddy
.
which
seal
shall
we
use
?
here
'
s
a
unicorn
'
s
head
there
'
s
nothing
in
that
.
what
'
s
this
?
two
doves
no
.
it
ought
to
be
something
extraordinary
,
ought
it
not
,
liddy
?
here
'
s
one
with
a
motto
i
remember
it
is
some
funny
one
,
but
i
ca
not
read
it
.
we
will
try
this
,
and
if
it
does
not
do
we
will
have
another
.
a
large
red
seal
was
duly
affixed
.
bathsheba
looked
closely
at
the
hot
wax
to
discover
the
words
.
capital
!
she
exclaimed
,
throwing
down
the
letter
frolicsomely
.
'
twould
upset
the
solemnity
of
a
parson
the
same
evening
the
letter
was
sent
,
and
was
duly
returned
to
weatherbury
again
in
the
morning
.
of
love
as
a
spectacle
bathsheba
had
a
fair
knowledge
;
but
of
love
subjectively
she
knew
nothing
.
at
dusk
,
on
the
evening
of
st
.
valentine
'
s
day
,
bold
-
wood
sat
down
to
supper
as
usual
,
by
a
beaming
fire
of
aged
logs
.
upon
the
mantel
-
shelf
before
him
was
a
time
-
piece
,
surmounted
by
a
spread
eagle
,
and
upon
the
eagle
'
s
wings
was
the
letter
bathsheba
had
sent
.
here
the
bachelor
'
s
gaze
was
continually
fastening
itself
,
till
the
large
red
seal
became
as
a
blot
of
blood
on
the
retina
of
his
eye
;
and
as
he
ate
and
drank
he
still
read
in
fancy
the
words
thereon
,
although
they
were
too
remote
for
his
sight
marry
me
.
the
pert
injunction
was
like
those
crystal
substances
which
,
colourless
themselves
,
assume
the
tone
of
objects
about
them
.
here
,
in
the
quiet
of
boldwood
'
s
parlour
,
where
everything
that
was
not
grave
was
extraneous
,
and
where
the
atmosphere
was
that
of
a
puritan
sunday
lasting
all
the
week
,
the
letter
and
its
dictum
changed
their
tenor
from
the
thoughtlessness
of
their
origin
to
a
deep
solemnity
,
imbibed
from
their
accessories
now
.
since
the
receipt
of
the
missive
in
the
morning
,
boldwood
had
felt
the
symmetry
of
his
existence
to
be
slowly
getting
distorted
in
the
direction
of
an
ideal
passion
.
the
disturbance
was
as
the
first
floating
weed
to
columbus
the
contemptibly
little
suggesting
possibilities
of
the
infinitely
great
.
the
letter
must
have
had
an
origin
and
a
motive
.
that
the
latter
was
of
the
smallest
magnitude
compatible
with
its
existence
at
all
,
boldwood
,
of
course
,
did
not
know
.
and
such
an
explanation
did
not
strike
him
as
a
possibility
even
.
it
is
foreign
to
a
mystified
condition
of
mind
to
realize
of
the
mystifier
that
the
processes
of
approving
a
course
suggested
by
circumstance
,
and
of
striking
out
a
course
from
inner
impulse
,
would
look
the
same
in
the
result
.
the
vast
difference
between
starting
a
train
of
events
,
and
direct
-
ing
into
a
particular
groove
a
series
already
started
,
is
rarely
apparent
to
the
person
confounded
by
the
issue
.
when
boldwood
went
to
bed
he
placed
the
valentine
in
the
corner
of
the
looking
-
glass
.
he
was
conscious
of
its
presence
,
even
when
his
back
was
turned
upon
it
.
it
was
the
first
time
in
boldwood
'
s
life
that
such
an
event
had
occurred
.
the
same
fascination
that
caused
him
to
think
it
an
act
which
had
a
deliberate
motive
prevented
him
from
regarding
it
as
an
impertinence
.
he
looked
again
at
the
direction
.
the
mysterious
influences
of
night
invested
the
writing
with
the
presence
of
the
unknown
writer
.
somebody
'
s
some
woman
'
s
hand
had
travelled
softly
over
the
paper
bearing
his
name
;
her
unrevealed
eyes
had
watched
every
curve
as
she
formed
it
;
her
brain
had
seen
him
in
imagination
the
while
.
why
should
she
have
imagined
him
?
her
mouth
were
the
lips
red
or
pale
,
plump
or
creased
?
had
curved
itself
to
a
certain
expression
as
the
pen
went
on
the
corners
had
moved
with
all
their
natural
tremulousness
:
what
had
been
the
expression
?
the
vision
of
the
woman
writing
,
as
a
supplement
to
the
words
written
,
had
no
individuality
.
she
was
a
misty
shape
,
and
well
she
might
be
,
considering
that
her
original
was
at
that
moment
sound
asleep
and
oblivious
of
all
love
and
letter
-
writing
under
the
sky
.
whenever
boldwood
dozed
she
took
a
form
,
and
comparatively
ceased
to
be
a
vision
:
when
he
awoke
there
was
the
letter
justifying
the
dream
.
the
moon
shone
to
-
night
,
and
its
light
was
not
of
a
customary
kind
.
his
window
admitted
only
a
reflection
of
its
rays
,
and
the
pale
sheen
had
that
reversed
direction
which
snow
gives
,
coming
upward
and
lighting
up
his
ceiling
in
an
unnatural
way
,
casting
shadows
in
strange
places
,
and
putting
lights
where
shadows
had
used
to
be
.
the
substance
of
the
epistle
had
occupied
him
but
little
in
comparison
with
the
fact
of
its
arrival
.
he
suddenly
wondered
if
anything
more
might
be
found
in
the
envelope
than
what
he
had
withdrawn
.
he
jumped
out
of
bed
in
the
weird
light
,
took
the
letter
,
pulled
out
the
flimsy
sheet
,
shook
the
envelope
searched
it
.
nothing
more
was
there
.
boldwood
looked
,
as
he
had
a
hundred
times
the
preceding
day
,
at
the
insistent
red
seal
:
marry
me
.
he
said
aloud
.
the
solemn
and
reserved
yeoman
again
closed
the
letter
,
and
stuck
it
in
the
frame
of
the
glass
.
in
doing
so
he
caught
sight
of
his
reflected
features
,
wan
in
expression
,
and
insubstantial
in
form
.
he
saw
how
closely
compressed
was
his
mouth
,
and
that
his
eyes
were
wide
-
spread
and
vacant
.
feeling
uneasy
and
dis
-
satisfied
with
himself
for
this
nervous
excitability
,
he
returned
to
bed
.
then
the
dawn
drew
on
.
the
full
power
of
the
clear
heaven
was
not
equal
to
that
of
a
cloudy
sky
at
noon
,
when
boldwood
arose
and
dressed
himself
.
he
descended
the
stairs
and
went
out
towards
the
gate
of
a
field
to
the
east
,
leaning
over
which
he
paused
and
looked
around
.
it
was
one
of
the
usual
slow
sunrises
of
this
time
of
the
year
,
and
the
sky
,
pure
violet
in
the
zenith
,
was
leaden
to
the
northward
,
and
murky
to
the
east
,
where
,
over
the
snowy
down
or
ewe
-
lease
on
weatherbury
upper
farm
,
and
apparently
resting
upon
the
ridge
,
the
only
half
of
the
sun
yet
visible
burnt
rayless
,
like
a
red
and
flameless
fire
shining
over
a
white
hearthstone
.
the
whole
effect
resembled
a
sunset
as
childhood
resembles
age
.
in
other
directions
,
the
fields
and
sky
were
so
much
of
one
colour
by
the
snow
,
that
it
was
difficult
in
a
hasty
glance
to
tell
whereabouts
the
horizon
occurred
;
and
in
general
there
was
here
,
too
,
that
before
-
mentioned
preternatural
inversion
of
light
and
shade
which
attends
the
prospect
when
the
garish
brightness
commonly
in
the
sky
is
found
on
the
earth
,
and
the
shades
of
earth
are
in
the
sky
.
over
the
west
hung
the
wasting
moon
,
now
dull
and
greenish
-
yellow
,
like
tarnished
brass
.
boldwood
was
listlessly
noting
how
the
frost
had
hardened
and
glazed
the
surface
of
the
snow
,
till
it
shone
in
the
red
eastern
light
wit
-
h
the
polish
of
marble
;
how
,
in
some
portions
of
the
slope
,
withered
grass
-
bents
,
encased
in
icicles
,
bristled
through
the
smooth
wan
coverlet
in
the
twisted
and
curved
shapes
of
old
venetian
glass
;
and
how
the
footprints
of
a
few
birds
,
which
had
hopped
over
the
snow
whilst
it
lay
in
the
state
of
a
soft
fleece
,
were
now
frozen
to
a
short
permanency
.
a
half
-
muffled
noise
of
light
wheels
interrupted
him
.
boldwood
turned
back
into
the
road
.
it
was
the
mail
-
cart
a
crazy
,
two
-
wheeled
vehicle
,
hardly
heavy
enough
to
resist
a
puff
of
wind
.
the
driver
held
out
a
letter
.
boldwood
seized
it
and
opened
it
,
ex
-
pecting
another
anonymous
one
so
greatly
are
people
'
s
ideas
of
probability
a
mere
sense
that
precedent
will
repeat
itself
.
i
do
not
think
it
is
for
you
,
sir
.
said
the
man
,
when
he
saw
boldwood
'
s
action
.
though
there
is
no
name
i
think
it
is
for
your
shepherd
.
boldwood
looked
then
at
the
address
to
the
new
shepherd
,
weatherbury
farm
,
near
casterbridge
.
oh
what
a
mistake
!
it
is
not
mine
.
nor
is
it
for
my
shepherd
.
it
is
for
miss
everdene
'
s
.
you
had
better
take
it
on
to
him
gabriel
oak
and
say
i
opened
it
in
mistake
.
at
this
moment
,
on
the
ridge
,
up
against
the
blazing
sky
,
a
figure
was
visible
,
like
the
black
snuff
in
the
midst
of
a
candle
-
flame
.
then
it
moved
and
began
to
bustle
about
vigorously
from
place
to
place
,
carrying
square
skeleton
masses
,
which
were
riddled
by
the
same
rays
.
a
small
figure
on
all
fours
followed
behind
.
the
tall
form
was
that
of
gabriel
oak
;
the
small
one
that
of
george
;
the
articles
in
course
of
transit
were
hurdles
.
wait
,
said
boldwood
.
that
'
s
the
man
on
the
hill
.
i
will
take
the
letter
to
him
myself
.
to
boldwood
it
was
now
no
longer
merely
a
letter
to
i
another
man
.
it
was
an
opportunity
.
exhibiting
a
face
pregnant
with
intention
,
he
entered
the
snowy
field
.
gabriel
,
at
that
minute
,
descended
the
hill
towards
the
right
.
the
glow
stretched
down
in
this
direction
now
,
and
touched
the
distant
roof
of
warren
'
s
malthouse
whither
the
shepherd
was
apparently
bent
:
boldwood
followed
at
a
distance
.
the
scarlet
and
orange
light
outside
the
malthouse
did
not
penetrate
to
its
interior
,
which
was
,
as
usual
,
lighted
by
a
rival
glow
of
similar
hue
,
radiating
from
the
hearth
.
the
maltster
,
after
having
lain
down
in
his
clothes
for
a
few
hours
,
was
now
sitting
beside
a
three
-
legged
table
,
breakfasting
of
bread
and
bacon
.
this
was
eaten
on
the
plateless
system
,
which
is
performed
by
placing
a
slice
of
bread
upon
the
table
,
the
meat
flat
upon
the
bread
,
a
mustard
plaster
upon
the
meat
,
and
a
pinch
of
salt
upon
the
whole
,
then
cutting
them
vertically
downwards
with
a
large
pocket
-
knife
till
wood
is
reached
,
when
the
severed
lamp
is
impaled
on
the
knife
,
elevated
,
and
sent
the
proper
way
of
food
.
the
maltster
'
s
lack
of
teeth
appeared
not
to
sensibly
diminish
his
powers
as
a
mill
.
he
had
been
without
them
for
so
many
years
that
toothlessness
was
felt
less
to
be
a
defect
than
hard
gums
an
acquisition
.
indeed
,
he
seemed
to
approach
the
grave
as
a
hyperbolic
curve
approaches
a
straight
line
less
directly
as
he
got
nearer
,
till
it
was
doubtful
if
he
would
ever
reach
it
at
all
.
in
the
ashpit
was
a
heap
of
potatoes
roasting
,
and
a
boiling
pipkin
of
charred
bread
,
called
coffee
.
for
the
benefit
of
whomsoever
should
call
,
for
warren
'
s
was
a
sort
of
clubhouse
.
used
as
an
alternative
to
the
in
!
i
say
,
says
i
,
we
get
a
fine
day
,
and
then
down
comes
a
snapper
at
night
.
was
a
remark
now
suddenly
heard
spreading
into
the
malthouse
from
the
door
,
which
had
been
opened
the
previous
moment
.
the
form
of
henery
fray
advanced
to
the
fire
,
stamping
the
snow
from
his
boots
when
about
half
-
way
there
.
the
speech
and
entry
had
not
seemed
to
be
at
all
an
abrupt
beginning
to
the
maltster
,
introductory
matter
being
often
omitted
in
this
neighbourhood
,
both
from
word
and
deed
,
and
the
maltster
having
the
same
latitude
allowed
him
,
did
not
hurry
to
reply
.
he
picked
up
a
fragment
of
cheese
,
by
pecking
upon
it
with
his
knife
,
as
a
butcher
picks
up
skewers
.
henery
appeared
in
a
drab
kerseymere
great
-
coat
,
buttoned
over
his
smock
-
frock
,
the
white
skirts
of
the
latter
being
visible
to
the
distance
of
about
a
foot
below
the
coat
-
tails
,
which
,
when
you
got
used
to
the
style
of
dress
,
looked
natural
enough
,
and
even
ornamental
it
certainly
was
comfortable
.
matthew
moon
,
joseph
poorgrass
,
and
other
carters
and
waggoners
followed
at
his
heels
,
with
great
lanterns
dangling
from
their
hands
,
which
showed
that
they
had
just
come
from
the
cart
-
horse
stables
,
where
they
had
been
busily
engaged
since
four
o
'
clock
that
morning
.
and
how
is
she
getting
on
without
a
baily
?
the
maltster
inquired
.
henery
shook
his
head
,
and
smiled
one
of
the
bitter
smiles
,
dragging
all
the
flesh
of
his
forehead
into
a
corrugated
heap
in
the
centre
.
she
will
rue
it
surely
,
surely
!
he
said
benjy
pennyways
were
not
a
true
man
or
an
honest
baily
as
big
a
betrayer
as
judas
iscariot
himself
.
but
to
think
she
can
carr
'
on
alone
!
he
allowed
his
head
to
swing
laterally
three
or
four
times
in
silence
.
never
in
all
my
creeping
up
never
!
this
was
recognized
by
all
as
the
conclusion
of
some
gloomy
speech
which
had
been
expressed
in
thought
alone
during
the
shake
of
the
head
;
henery
meanwhile
retained
several
marks
of
despair
upon
his
face
,
to
imply
that
they
would
be
required
for
use
again
directly
he
should
go
on
speaking
.
all
will
be
ruined
,
and
ourselves
too
,
or
there
'
s
no
meat
in
gentlemen

said
mark

headstrong
maid
,
that
'

what
she
is
and
wo
not

no

said
joseph
poorgrass
in
a
voice
of
thorough
attestation
,
and
with
a
wire
-
drawn
smile
of
misery
.

his
one
tooth
before
him

ye
foller
me
?
i
do
:
but
no
baily
i
deserved
that
place
.
wailed
henery
,
signifying
wasted
genius
by
gazing
blankly
at
visions
of
a
high
destiny
apparently
visible
to
him
on
billy

there

i
suppose

your
lot
is
your
lot
,
and
scripture

nothing
;
for
if
you
do
good
you
do
not
get
rewarded
according
to
your
works
,
but
be

to
speak
it
.
attested
joseph
poorgrass
.
a
short
pause
ensued
,
and
as
a
sort
of
entr
'
acte
henery
turned
and
blew
out
the
lanterns
,
which
the
increase
of
daylight
rendered
no
longer
necessary
even
in
the
malthouse
,
with
its
one
pane
of
glass
.
i
wonder
what
a
farmer
-
woman
can
want
with
a
harpsichord
,
dulcimer
,
pianner
,
or

she
'

a
new
one

a
pianner
?
ay
.
seems
her
old
uncle
'

things
were
not
good
enough
for
her
.
she
'

bought
all
but
everything
new
.
there
'

heavy
chairs
for
the

ones
for
the
slender
;
great
watches
,
getting
on
to
the
size
of
clocks
,
to
stand
upon
the
chimbley

for
the
most
part
wonderful
frames

for
the

lying
books
for
the

.
firm
loud
tread
was
now
heard
stamping
outside
;
the
door
was
opened
about
six
inches
,
and
somebody
on
the
other
side
exclaimed
neighbours
,
have
ye
got
room
for
a
few
new
-
born
lambs
?
ay
,

,
shepherd
.
said
the
conclave
.
the
door
was
flung
back
till
it
kicked
the
wall
and
trembled
from
top
to
bottom
with
the
blow
.
mr
oak
appeared
in
the
entry
with
a
steaming
face
,
hay
-
bands
wound
about
his
ankles
to
keep
out
the
snow
,
a
leather
strap
round
his
waist
outside
the
smock
-
frock
,
and
looking
altogether
an
epitome
of
the
world
'
s
health
and
vigour
.
four
lambs
hung
in
various
embarrassing
attitudes
over
his
shoulders
,
and
the
dog
george
,
whom
gabriel
had
contrived
to
fetch
from
norcombe
,
stalked
solemnly
behind
.
well
,
shepherd
oak
,
and
how
'
s
lambing
this
year
,
if
i

inquired
joseph
poorgrass
.
terrible
trying
,
said
oak
.
i
'
ve
been
wet
through
twice
a

day
,
either
in
snow
or
rain
,
this
last
fortnight
.
cainy

our
eyes

few
twins
,

,
i
hear
?
too
many
by

yes
;
'
tis
a
very
queer
lambing
this
year
.
we

by
lady

.
and
last

gabriel
,

then
run
back
to
the
ewes
.
i
will
follow
you
soon
.
cainy
ball
a
cheery
-
faced
young
lad
,
with
a
small
circular
orifice
by
way
of
mouth
,
advanced
and
deposited
two
others
,
and
retired
as
he
was
bidden
.
oak
lowered
the
lambs
from
their
unnatural
elevation
,
wrapped
them
in
hay
,
and
placed
them
round
the
fire
.
we
'
ve
no
lambing
-
hut
here
,
as
i
used
to
have
at
norcombe
.
said
gabriel
,
and
'
tis
such
a
plague
to
bring
the
weakly
ones
to
a
house
.
if
'
twas
not
for
your
place
here
,
malter
,
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
do
!
this
keen
weather
.
and
how
is
it
with
you
to
-
day
,
malter
?
oh
,
neither
sick
nor
sorry
,
shepherd
,
but
no
younger
.
ay
i
understand
.
sit
down
,
shepherd
oak
,
continued
the
ancient
man
of
malt
.
and
how
was
the
old
place
at
norcombe
,
when
ye
went
for
your
dog
?
i
should
like
to
see
the
old
familiar
spot
;
but
faith
,
i
should
not
know
a
soul
there
now
.
i
suppose
you
wouldn
'
t
.
'
tis
altered
very
much
.
is
it
true
that
dicky
hill
'
s
wooden
cider
-
house
is
pulled
down
?
o
yes
years
ago
,
and
dicky
'
s
cottage
just
above
it
.
well
,
to
be
sure
!
,
yes
;
and
tompkins
'
s
old
apple
-
tree
is
rooted
that
used
to
bear
two
hogsheads
of
cider
;
and
no
help
from
other
trees
.
rooted
?
you
do
not
say
it
!
ah
!
stirring
times
we
live
in
stirring
times
.
and
you
can
mind
the
old
well
that
used
to
be
in
the
middle
of
the
place
?
that
'
s
turned
into
a
solid
iron
pump
with
a
large
stone
trough
,
and
all
complete
.
dear
,
dear
how
the
face
of
nations
alter
,
and
what
we
live
to
see
nowadays
!
yes
and
'
tis
the
same
here
.
they
'
ve
been
talking
but
now
of
the
mis
'
ess
'
s
strange
doings
.
what
have
you
been
saying
about
her
?
inquired
oak
,
sharply
turning
to
the
rest
,
and
getting
very
warm
.
these
middle
-
aged
men
have
been
pulling
her
over
the
coals
for
pride
and
vanity
.
said
mark
clark
;
but
i
say
,
let
her
have
rope
enough
.
bless
her
pretty
face
should
not
i
like
to
do
so
upon
her
cherry
lips
!
the
gallant
mark
clark
here
made
a
peculiar
and
well
known
sound
with
his
own
.
mark
.
said
gabriel
,
sternly
,
now
you
mind
this
!
none
of
that
dalliance
-
talk
that
smack
-
and
-
coddle
style
of
yours
about
miss
everdene
.
i
do
not
allow
it
.
do
you
hear
?
with
all
my
heart
,
as
i
'
ve
got
no
chance
.
replied
mr
clark
,
cordially
.
i
suppose
you
'
ve
been
speaking
against
her
?
said
oak
,
turning
to
joseph
poorgrass
with
a
very
grim
look
.
no
,
no
not
a
word
i
'
tis
a
real
joyful
thing
that
she
is
no
worse
,
that
'
s
what
i
say
.
said
joseph
,
trembling
and
blushing
with
terror
.
matthew
just
said
matthew
moon
,
what
have
you
been
saying
?
asked
oak
.
i
?
why
ye
know
i
would
not
harm
a
worm
no
,
not
one
underground
worm
?
said
matthew
moon
,
looking
very
uneasy
.
well
,
somebody
has
and
look
here
,
neighbours
.
gabriel
,
though
one
of
the
quietest
and
most
gentle
men
on
earth
,
rose
to
the
occasion
,
with
martial
promptness
and
vigour
.
that
'
s
my
fist
.
here
he
placed
his
fist
,
rather
smaller
in
size
than
a
common
loaf
,
in
the
mathematical
centre
of
the
maltster
'
s
little
table
,
and
with
it
gave
a
bump
or
two
thereon
,
as
if
to
ensure
that
their
eyes
all
thoroughly
took
in
the
idea
of
fistiness
before
he
went
further
.
now
the
first
man
in
the
parish
that
i
hear
prophesying
bad
of
our
mistress
,
why
(
here
the
fist
was
raised
and
let
fall
as
thor
might
have
done
with
his
hammer
in
assaying
it
)
he
will
smell
and
taste
that
or
i
am
a
dutchman
.
all
earnestly
expressed
by
their
features
that
their
minds
did
not
wander
to
holland
for
a
moment
on
account
of
this
statement
,
but
were
deploring
the
difference
which
gave
rise
to
the
figure
;
and
mark
clark
cried
hear
,
hear
;
just
what
i
should
ha
'
said
.
the
dog
george
looked
up
at
the
same
time
after
the
shepherd
'
s
menace
,
and
though
he
understood
english
but
imperfectly
,
began
to
growl
.
now
,
do
not
ye
take
on
so
,
shepherd
,
and
sit
down
!
said
henery
,
with
a
deprecating
peacefulness
equal
to
anything
of
the
kind
in
christianity
.
we
hear
that
ye
be
a
extraordinary
good
and
clever
man
,
shepherd
.
said
joseph
poorgrass
with
considerable
anxiety
from
behind
the
maltster
'
s
bed
-
stead
whither
he
had
retired
for
safety
.
'
tis
a
great
thing
to
be
clever
,
i
am
sure
.
he
added
,
making
movements
associated
with
states
of
mind
rather
than
body
;
we
wish
we
were
,
do
not
we
,
neighbours
?
ay
,
that
we
do
,
sure
.
said
matthew
moon
,
with
a
small
anxious
laugh
towards
oak
,
to
show
how
very
friendly
disposed
he
was
likewise
.
who
'
s
been
telling
you
i
am
clever
?
said
oak
.
'
tis
blowed
about
from
pillar
to
post
quite
common
,
said
matthew
.
we
hear
that
ye
can
tell
the
time
as
well
by
the
stars
as
we
can
by
the
sun
and
moon
,
shepherd
.
yes
,
i
can
do
a
little
that
way
.
said
gabriel
,
as
a
man
of
medium
sentiments
on
the
subject
.
names
upon
their
waggons
almost
like
copper
-
plate
,
with
beautiful
flourishes
,
and
great
long
tails
.
a
excellent
fine
thing
for
ye
to
be
such
a
clever
man
,
shepherd
.
joseph
poorgrass
used
to
prent
to
farmer
james
everdene
'
s
waggons
before
you
came
,
and
'
a
could
never
mind
which
way
to
turn
the
j
'
s
and
e
'
s
could
ye
,
joseph
?
joseph
shook
his
head
to
express
how
absolute
was
the
fact
that
he
couldn
'
t
.
and
so
you
used
to
do
'
em
the
wrong
way
,
like
this
,
did
not
ye
,
joseph
?
matthew
marked
on
the
dusty
floor
with
his
whip
-
handle
.
and
how
farmer
james
would
cuss
,
and
call
thee
a
fool
,
would
not
he
,
joseph
,
when
'
a
seed
his
name
looking
so
inside
-
out
-
like
?
continued
matthew
moon
with
feeling
.
ay
'
a
would
.
said
joseph
,
meekly
.
but
,
you
see
,
i
was
not
so
much
to
blame
,
for
them
j
'
s
and
e
'
s
be
such
trying
sons
o
'
witches
for
the
memory
to
mind
whether
they
face
backward
or
forward
;
and
i
always
had
such
a
forgetful
memory
,
too
.
'
tis
a
bad
afiction
for
ye
,
being
such
a
man
of
calamities
in
other
ways
.
well
,
'
tis
;
but
a
happy
providence
ordered
that
it
should
be
no
worse
,
and
i
feel
my
thanks
.
as
to
shepherd
,
there
,
i
am
sure
mis
'
ess
ought
to
have
made
ye
her
baily
such
a
fitting
man
for
'
t
as
you
be
.
i
do
not
mind
owning
that
i
expected
it
.
said
oak
,
frankly
.
indeed
,
i
hoped
for
the
place
.
at
the
same
time
,
miss
everdene
has
a
right
to
be
own
baily
if
she
choose
and
to
keep
me
down
to
be
a
common
shepherd
only
.
oak
drew
a
slow
breath
,
looked
sadly
into
the
bright
ashpit
,
and
seemed
lost
in
thoughts
not
of
the
most
hopeful
hue
.
the
genial
warmth
of
the
fire
now
began
to
stimulate
the
nearly
lifeless
lambs
to
bleat
and
move
