the
next
day
jude
fawley
was
pausing
in
his
bedroom
with
the
sloping
ceiling
,
looking
at
the
books
on
the
table
,
and
then
at
the
black
mark
on
the
plaster
above
them
,
made
by
the
smoke
of
his
lamp
in
past
months
.
it
was
sunday
afternoon
,
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
after
his
meeting
with
arabella
donn
.
during
the
whole
bygone
week
he
had
been
resolving
to
set
this
afternoon
apart
for
a
special
purpose
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
re
-
reading
of
his
greek
testament
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
his
new
one
,
with
better
type
than
his
old
copy
,
following
griesbach
'
s
text
as
amended
by
numerous
correctors
,
and
with
variorum
readings
in
the
margin
.
he
was
proud
of
the
book
,
having
obtained
it
by
boldly
writing
to
its
london
publisher
,
a
thing
he
had
never
done
before
.
he
had
anticipated
much
pleasure
in
this
afternoon
'
s
reading
,
under
the
quiet
roof
of
his
great
-
aunt
'
s
house
as
formerly
,
where
he
now
slept
only
two
nights
a
week
.
but
a
new
thing
,
a
great
hitch
,
had
happened
yesterday
in
the
gliding
and
noiseless
current
of
his
life
,
and
he
felt
as
a
snake
must
feel
who
has
sloughed
off
its
winter
skin
,
and
cannot
understand
the
brightness
and
sensitiveness
of
its
new
one
.
he
would
not
go
out
to
meet
her
,
after
all
.
he
sat
down
,
opened
the
book
,
and
with
his
elbows
firmly
planted
on
the
table
,
and
his
hands
to
his
temples
began
at
the
beginning
:
had
he
promised
to
call
for
her
?
surely
he
had
!
she
would
wait
indoors
,
poor
girl
,
and
waste
all
her
afternoon
on
account
of
him
.
there
was
a
something
in
her
,
too
,
which
was
very
winning
,
apart
from
promises
.
he
ought
not
to
break
faith
with
her
.
even
though
he
had
only
sundays
and
week
-
day
evenings
for
reading
he
could
afford
one
afternoon
,
seeing
that
other
young
men
afforded
so
many
.
after
to
-
day
he
would
never
probably
see
her
again
.
indeed
,
it
would
be
impossible
,
considering
what
his
plans
were
.
in
short
,
as
if
materially
,
a
compelling
arm
of
extraordinary
muscular
power
seized
hold
of
him
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
something
which
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
spirits
and
influences
that
had
moved
him
hitherto
.
this
seemed
to
care
little
for
his
reason
and
his
will
,
nothing
for
his
so
-
called
elevated
intentions
,
and
moved
him
along
,
as
a
violent
schoolmaster
a
schoolboy
he
has
seized
by
the
collar
,
in
a
direction
which
tended
towards
the
embrace
of
a
woman
for
whom
he
had
no
respect
,
and
whose
life
had
nothing
in
common
with
his
own
except
locality
.
was
no
more
heeded
,
and
the
predestinate
jude
sprang
up
and
across
the
room
.
foreseeing
such
an
event
he
had
already
arrayed
himself
in
his
best
clothes
.
in
three
minutes
he
was
out
of
the
house
and
descending
by
the
path
across
the
wide
vacant
hollow
of
corn
-
ground
which
lay
between
the
village
and
the
isolated
house
of
arabella
in
the
dip
beyond
the
upland
.
as
he
walked
he
looked
at
his
watch
.
he
could
be
back
in
two
hours
,
easily
,
and
a
good
long
time
would
still
remain
to
him
for
reading
after
tea
.
passing
the
few
unhealthy
fir
-
trees
and
cottage
where
the
path
joined
the
highway
he
hastened
along
,
and
struck
away
to
the
left
,
descending
the
steep
side
of
the
country
to
the
west
of
the
brown
house
.
here
at
the
base
of
the
chalk
formation
he
neared
the
brook
that
oozed
from
it
,
and
followed
the
stream
till
he
reached
her
dwelling
.
a
smell
of
piggeries
came
from
the
back
,
and
the
grunting
of
the
originators
of
that
smell
.
he
entered
the
garden
,
and
knocked
at
the
door
with
the
knob
of
his
stick
.
somebody
had
seen
him
through
the
window
,
for
a
male
voice
on
the
inside
said
:
"
arabella
!
here
'
s
your
young
man
come
coorting
!
mizzle
,
my
girl
!
"
jude
winced
at
the
words
.
courting
in
such
a
business
-
like
aspect
as
it
evidently
wore
to
the
speaker
was
the
last
thing
he
was
thinking
of
.
he
was
going
to
walk
with
her
,
perhaps
kiss
her
;
but
"
courting
"
was
too
coolly
purposeful
to
be
anything
but
repugnant
to
his
ideas
.
the
door
was
opened
and
he
entered
,
just
as
arabella
came
downstairs
in
radiant
walking
attire
.
"
take
a
chair
,
mr
what
'
s
-
your
-
name
?
"
said
her
father
,
an
energetic
,
black
-
whiskered
man
,
in
the
same
businesslike
tones
jude
had
heard
from
outside
.
"
i
'
d
rather
go
out
at
once
,
would
not
you
?
"
she
whispered
to
jude
.
"
yes
,
"
said
he
.
"
we
will
walk
up
to
the
brown
house
and
back
,
we
can
do
it
in
half
an
hour
.
"
arabella
looked
so
handsome
amid
her
untidy
surroundings
that
he
felt
glad
he
had
come
,
and
all
the
misgivings
vanished
that
had
hitherto
haunted
him
.
first
they
clambered
to
the
top
of
the
great
down
,
during
which
ascent
he
had
occasionally
to
take
her
hand
to
assist
her
.
then
they
bore
off
to
the
left
along
the
crest
into
the
ridgeway
,
which
they
followed
till
it
intersected
the
high
-
road
at
the
brown
house
aforesaid
,
the
spot
of
his
former
fervid
desires
to
behold
christminster
.
but
he
forgot
them
now
.
he
talked
the
commonest
local
twaddle
to
arabella
with
greater
zest
than
he
would
have
felt
in
discussing
all
the
philosophies
with
all
the
dons
in
the
recently
adored
university
,
and
passed
the
spot
where
he
had
knelt
to
diana
and
phoebus
without
remembering
that
there
were
any
such
people
in
the
mythology
,
or
that
the
sun
was
anything
else
than
a
useful
lamp
for
illuminating
arabella
'
s
face
.
an
indescribable
lightness
of
heel
served
to
lift
him
along
;
and
jude
,
the
incipient
scholar
,
prospective
dd
.
,
professor
,
bishop
,
or
what
not
,
felt
himself
honoured
and
glorified
by
the
condescension
of
this
handsome
country
wench
in
agreeing
to
take
a
walk
with
him
in
her
sunday
frock
and
ribbons
.
they
reached
the
brown
house
barn
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
point
at
which
he
had
planned
to
turn
back
.
while
looking
over
the
vast
northern
landscape
from
this
spot
they
were
struck
by
the
rising
of
a
dense
volume
of
smoke
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
little
town
which
lay
beneath
them
at
a
distance
of
a
couple
of
miles
.
"
it
is
a
fire
,
"
said
arabella
.
"
let
'
s
run
and
see
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
do
!
it
is
not
far
!
"
the
tenderness
which
had
grown
up
in
jude
'
s
bosom
left
him
no
will
to
thwart
her
inclination
now
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
which
pleased
him
in
affording
him
excuse
for
a
longer
time
with
her
.
they
started
off
down
the
hill
almost
at
a
trot
;
but
on
gaining
level
ground
at
the
bottom
,
and
walking
a
mile
,
they
found
that
the
spot
of
the
fire
was
much
further
off
than
it
had
seemed
.
having
begun
their
journey
,
however
,
they
pushed
on
;
but
it
was
not
till
five
o
'
clock
that
they
found
themselves
on
the
scene
,
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
distance
being
altogether
about
half
-
a
-
dozen
miles
from
marygreen
,
and
three
from
arabella
'
s
.
the
conflagration
had
been
got
under
by
the
time
they
reached
it
,
and
after
a
short
inspection
of
the
melancholy
ruins
they
retraced
their
steps
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
their
course
lying
through
the
town
of
alfredston
.
arabella
said
she
would
like
some
tea
,
and
they
entered
an
inn
of
an
inferior
class
,
and
gave
their
order
.
as
it
was
not
for
beer
they
had
a
long
time
to
wait
.
the
maid
-
servant
recognized
jude
,
and
whispered
her
surprise
to
her
mistress
in
the
background
,
that
he
,
the
student
"
who
kept
hisself
up
so
particular
,
"
should
have
suddenly
descended
so
low
as
to
keep
company
with
arabella
.
the
latter
guessed
what
was
being
said
,
and
laughed
as
she
met
the
serious
and
tender
gaze
of
her
lover
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
low
and
triumphant
laugh
of
a
careless
woman
who
sees
she
is
winning
her
game
.
they
sat
and
looked
round
the
room
,
and
at
the
picture
of
samson
and
delilah
which
hung
on
the
wall
,
and
at
the
circular
beer
-
stains
on
the
table
,
and
at
the
spittoons
underfoot
filled
with
sawdust
.
the
whole
aspect
of
the
scene
had
that
depressing
effect
on
jude
which
few
places
can
produce
like
a
tap
-
room
on
a
sunday
evening
when
the
setting
sun
is
slanting
in
,
and
no
liquor
is
going
,
and
the
unfortunate
wayfarer
finds
himself
with
no
other
haven
of
rest
.
it
began
to
grow
dusk
.
they
could
not
wait
longer
,
really
,
for
the
tea
,
they
said
.
"
yet
what
else
can
we
do
?
"
asked
jude
.
"
it
is
a
three

mile
walk
for
you
.
"
"
i
suppose

can

some
beer

"
said
arabella
.
"
beer
,
oh
yes
.
i
had
forgotten
that
.
somehow
it
seems
odd
to
come
to
a
public
-
house
for
beer
on
a
sunday
evening
.
"
"
but

jude
by
this
time
wished
he
was
out
of
such
an
uncongenial
atmosphere
;
but
he
ordered
the
beer
,
which
was
promptly
brought
.
arabella
tasted
it
.
"
ugh
!
"
she
said
.

'

the
matter
with
it

he
asked
.
"

beer
very
much
now
,
it

true
.
i
like
it
well
enough
,
but
it
is
bad
to

i
find
coffee
better

this
seems
all
right
.
"
"

"
she
mentioned
three
or
four
ingredients
that
she
detected
in
the
liquor
beyond
malt
and
hops
,
much
to
jude
'
s
surprise
.
"
how
much
you
know
!
"
he
said
good
-
humouredly
.
nevertheless
she
returned
to
the
beer
and
drank
her
share
,
and
they
went
on
their
way
.
it
was
now
nearly
dark
,
and
as
soon
as
they
had
withdrawn
from
the
lights
of
the
town
they
walked
closer
together
,
till
they
touched
each
other
.
she
wondered
why
he
did
not
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
but
he
did
not
;
he
merely
said
what
to
himself
seemed
a
quite
bold
enough
thing
:
"
take
my
arm
.
"
she
took
it
,
thoroughly
,
up
to
the
shoulder
.
he
felt
the
warmth
of
her
body
against
his
,
and
putting
his
stick
under
his
other
arm
held
with
his
right
hand
her
right
as
it
rested
in
its
place
.
"
now
we
are
well
together
,
dear
,
are
not
we
?
"
he
observed
.
"
yes
,
"
said
she
;
adding
to
herself
:
"
rather
mild
!
"
"
how
fast
i
have
become
!
"
he
was
thinking
.
thus
they
walked
till
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
upland
,
where
they
could
see
the
white
highway
ascending
before
them
in
the
gloom
.
from
this
point
the
only
way
of
getting
to
arabella

s
was
by
going
up
the
incline
,
and
dipping
again
into
her
valley
on
the
right
.
before
they
had
climbed
far
they
were
nearly
run
into
by
two
men
who
had
been
walking
on
the
grass
unseen
.
"
these
lovers
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
you
find
'
em
out
o
'
doors
in
all
seasons
and
weathers
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
lovers
and
homeless
dogs
only
,
"
said
one
of
the
men
as
they
vanished
down
the
hill
.
arabella
tittered
lightly
.
"
are
we
lovers
?
"
asked
jude
.
"
you
know
best
.
"
"
but
you
can
tell
me
?
"
for
answer
she
inclined
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
.
jude
took
the
hint
,
and
encircling
her
waist
with
his
arm
,
pulled
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
.
they
walked
now
no
longer
arm
in
arm
but
,
as
she
had
desired
,
clasped
together
.
after
all
,
what
did
it
matter
since
it
was
dark
,
said
jude
to
himself
.
when
they
were
half
-
way
up
the
long
hill
they
paused
as
by
arrangement
,
and
he
kissed
her
again
.
they
reached
the
top
,
and
he
kissed
her
once
more
.
"
you
can
keep
your
arm
there
,
if
you
would
like
to
,
"
she
said
gently
.
he
did
so
,
thinking
how
trusting
she
was
.
thus
they
slowly
went
towards
her
home
.
he
had
left
his
cottage
at
half
-
past
three
,
intending
to
be
sitting
down
again
to
the
new
testament
by
half
-
past
five
.
it
was
nine
o
'
clock
when
,
with
another
embrace
,
he
stood
to
deliver
her
up
at
her
father
'
s
door
.
she
asked
him
to
come
in
,
if
only
for
a
minute
,
as
it
would
seem
so
odd
otherwise
,
and
as
if
she
had
been
out
alone
in
the
dark
.
he
gave
way
,
and
followed
her
in
.
immediately
that
the
door
was
opened
he
found
,
in
addition
to
her
parents
,
several
neighbours
sitting
round
.
they
all
spoke
in
a
congratulatory
manner
,
and
took
him
seriously
as
arabella
'
s
intended
partner
.
they
did
not
belong
to
his
set
or
circle
,
and
he
felt
out
of
place
and
embarrassed
.
he
had
not
meant
this
:
a
mere
afternoon
of
pleasant
walking
with
arabella
,
that
was
all
he
had
meant
.
he
did
not
stay
longer
than
to
speak
to
her
stepmother
,
a
simple
,
quiet
woman
without
features
or
character
;
and
bidding
them
all
good
night
plunged
with
a
sense
of
relief
into
the
track
over
the
down
.
but
that
sense
was
only
temporary
:
arabella
soon
re
-
asserted
her
sway
in
his
soul
.
he
walked
as
if
he
felt
himself
to
be
another
man
from
the
jude
of
yesterday
.
what
were
his
books
to
him
?
what
were
his
intentions
,
hitherto
adhered
to
so
strictly
,
as
to
not
wasting
a
single
minute
of
time
day
by
day
?
"
wasting
!
"
it
depended
on
your
point
of
view
to
define
that
:
he
was
just
living
for
the
first
time
:
not
wasting
life
.
it
was
better
to
love
a
woman
than
to
be
a
graduate
,
or
a
parson
;
ay
,
or
a
pope
!
when
he
got
back
to
the
house
his
aunt
had
gone
to
bed
,
and
a
general
consciousness
of
his
neglect
seemed
written
on
the
face
of
all
things
confronting
him
.
he
went
upstairs
without
a
light
,
and
the
dim
interior
of
his
room
accosted
him
with
sad
inquiry
.
there
lay
his
book
open
,
just
as
he
had
left
it
,
and
the
capital
letters
on
the
title
-
page
regarded
him
with
fixed
reproach
in
the
grey
starlight
,
like
the
unclosed
eyes
of
a
dead
man
:
jude
had
to
leave
early
next
morning
for
his
usual
week
of
absence
at
lodgings
;
and
it
was
with
a
sense
of
futility
that
he
threw
into
his
basket
upon
his
tools
and
other
necessaries
the
unread
book
he
had
brought
with
him
.
he
kept
his
impassioned
doings
a
secret
almost
from
himself
.
arabella
,
on
the
contrary
,
made
them
public
among
all
her
friends
and
acquaintance
.
retracing
by
the
light
of
dawn
the
road
he
had
followed
a
few
hours
earlier
under
cover
of
darkness
,
with
his
sweetheart
by
his
side
,
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
,
where
he
walked
slowly
,
and
stood
still
.
he
was
on
the
spot
where
he
had
given
her
the
first
kiss
.
as
the
sun
had
only
just
risen
it
was
possible
that
nobody
had
passed
there
since
.
jude
looked
on
the
ground
and
sighed
.
he
looked
closely
,
and
could
just
discern
in
the
damp
dust
the
imprints
of
their
feet
as
they
had
stood
locked
in
each
other
'
s
arms
.
she
was
not
there
now
,
and
"
the
embroidery
of
imagination
upon
the
stuff
of
nature
"
so
depicted
her
past
presence
that
a
void
was
in
his
heart
which
nothing
could
fill
.
a
pollard
willow
stood
close
to
the
place
,
and
that
willow
was
different
from
all
other
willows
in
the
world
.
utter
annihilation
of
the
six
days
which
must
elapse
before
he
could
see
her
again
as
he
had
promised
would
have
been
his
intensest
wish
if
he
had
had
only
the
week
to
live
.
an
hour
and
a
half
later
arabella
came
along
the
same
way
with
her
two
companions
of
the
saturday
.
she
passed
unheedingly
the
scene
of
the
kiss
,
and
the
willow
that
marked
it
,
though
chattering
freely
on
the
subject
to
the
other
two
.
"
and
what
did
he
tell
'
ee
next
?
"
"
then
he
said
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
and
she
related
almost
word
for
word
some
of
his
tenderest
speeches
.
if
jude
had
been
behind
the
fence
he
would
have
felt
not
a
little
surprised
at
learning
how
very
few
of
his
sayings
and
doings
on
the
previous
evening
were
private
.
"

ve

murmured
anny
judicially
.
"

is
well
to
be

"
in
a
few
moments
arabella
replied
in
a
curiously
low
,
hungry
tone
of
latent
sensuousness
:

arabella

looked
at

turning
up
their

in
drollery

went
up
close

arabella
pursued
her
way
in
silent
thought
.
"

try

"
she
whispered
;
but
not
to
them
.
one
week
'
s
end
jude
was
as
usual
walking
out
to
his
aunt
'
s
at
marygreen
from
his
lodging
in
alfredston
,
a
walk
which
now
had
large
attractions
for
him
quite
other
than
his
desire
to
see
his
aged
and
morose
relative
.
he
diverged
to
the
right
before
ascending
the
hill
with
the
single
purpose
of
gaining
,
on
his
way
,
a
glimpse
of
arabella
that
should
not
come
into
the
reckoning
of
regular
appointments
.
before
quite
reaching
the
homestead
his
alert
eye
perceived
the
top
of
her
head
moving
quickly
hither
and
thither
over
the
garden
hedge
.
entering
the
gate
he
found
that
three
young
unfattened
pigs
had
escaped
from
their
sty
by
leaping
clean
over
the
top
,
and
that
she
was
endeavouring
unassisted
to
drive
them
in
through
the
door
which
she
had
set
open
.
the
lines
of
her
countenance
changed
from
the
rigidity
of
business
to
the
softness
of
love
when
she
saw
jude
,
and
she
bent
her
eyes
languishingly
upon
him
.
the
animals
took
a
vantage
of
the
pause
by
doubling
and
bolting
out
of
the
way
.
"
they
were
only
put
in
this
morning

"
she
cried
,
stimulated
to
pursue
in
spite
of
her
lover
'
s
presence
.
"

were

from
spaddleholt

you
shut
the

"
he
set
himself
to
assist
,
and
dodged
this
way
and
that
over
the
potato
rows
and
the
cabbages
.
every
now
and
then
they
ran
together
,
when
he
caught
her
for
a
moment
an
kissed
her
.
the
first
pig
was
got
back
promptly
;
the
second
with
some
difficulty
;
the
third
a
long
-
legged
creature
,
was
more
obstinate
and
agile
.
he
plunged
through
a
hole
in
the
garden
hedge
,
and
into
the
lane
.
"
he
will
be
lost
if

do
not
follow
'
n

said
she
.
"
come
along
with
me

"
she
rushed
in
full
pursuit
out
of
the
garden
,
jude
alongside
her
,
barely
contriving
to
keep
the
fugitive
in
sight
.
occasionally
they
would
shout
to
some
boy
to
stop
the
animal
,
but
he
always
wriggled
past

gave
him

along
together

sped

swerved

herself
down

followed

a
pet
lamb

she
slackened
her
pace
and
walked
beside
him

talking
calmly
on
indifferent
subjects

always
checking
him
if

tried

withdrew

went

on
sunday
morning
the
interior
of

,

,
the
scene
of
a
grand
weekly

special

in
the
afternoon
arabella
met
and
walked
with
jude
,
who
had
now
for
weeks
ceased
to
look
into
a
book
of
greek
,
latin
,
or
any
other
tongue
.
they
wandered
up
the
slopes
till
they
reached
the
green
track
along
the
ridge
,
which
they
followed
to
the
circular
british
earth
-
bank
adjoining
,
jude
thinking
of
the
great
age
of
the
trackway
,
and
of
the
drovers
who
had
frequented
it
,
probably
before
the
romans
knew
the
country
.
up
from
the
level
lands
below
them
floated
the
chime
of
church
bells
.
presently
they
were
reduced
to
one
note
,
which
quickened
,
and
stopped
.
"

arabella
,

had
attended
to

sounds

assented

so
long
as
he
was
near
her
he
minded
little
where
he
was
.
when
they
arrived
at
her
house

said
lingeringly
:

added

searching
behind
the
scraper

found
the
key

unlocked
the
door
.

down

long
time
what
had
become
of
her
,

a
laugh
revealed
her
to
have
rushed
up
the
stairs
,
whither
jude
rushed
at
her
heels
.
it
was
some
two
months
later
in
the
year
,
and
the
pair
had
met
constantly
during
the
interval
.
arabella
seemed
dissatisfied
;
she
was
always
imagining
,
and
waiting
,
and
wondering
.
one
day
she
met
the
itinerant
vilbert
.
she
,
like
all
the
cottagers
thereabout
,
knew
the
quack
well
,
and
she
began
telling
him
of
her
experiences
.
arabella
had
been
gloomy
,
but
before
he
left
her
she
had
grown
brighter
.
that
evening
she
kept
an
appointment
with
jude
,
who
seemed
sad
.
"
i
am
going
away
,

he
said
to
her
.
"

i

to
go

it
will
be
better

for

arabella
began
to
cry

not

late

she
said

very
well

not
told
you

she
looked
into
his
face
with
streaming
eyes
.
"
what

he
asked
,
turning
pale
.

course
if
that

of
course
i
never
dreamt
six
months

,

even

it
is
a
complete
smashing
up
of
my

my
plans
before

what
are
they
,
after
all
!
dreams
about
books
,
and
degrees
,
and
impossible
fellowships
,
and
all
that
.
certainly
we
will
marry
:
we
must

"
that
night
he
went
out
alone
,
and
walked
in
the
dark
self
-
communing
.
he
knew
well
,
too
well
,
in
the
secret
centre
of
his
brain
,
that
arabella
was
not
worth
a
great
deal
as
a
specimen
of
womankind
.
yet
,
such
being
the
custom
of
the
rural
districts
among
honourable
young
men
who
had
drifted
so
far
into
intimacy
with
a
woman
as
he
unfortunately
had
done
,
he
was
ready
to
abide
by
what
he
had
said
,
and
take
the
consequences
.
for
his
own
soothing
he
kept
up
a
factitious
belief
in
her
.
his
idea
of
her
was
the
thing
of
most
consequence
,
not
arabella
herself
,
he
sometimes
said
laconically
.
the
banns
were
put
in
and
published
the
very
next
sunday
.
the
people
of
the
parish
all
said
what
a
simple
fool
young
fawley
was
.
all
his
reading
had
only
come
to
this
,
that
he
would
have
to
sell
his
books
to
buy
saucepans
.
those
who
guessed
the
probable
state
of
affairs
,
arabella
'
s
parents
being
among
them
,
declared
that
it
was
the
sort
of
conduct
they
would
have
expected
of
such
an
honest
young
man
as
jude
in
reparation
of
the
wrong
he
had
done
his
innocent
sweetheart
.
the
parson
who
married
them
seemed
to
think
it
satisfactory
too
.
and
so
,
standing
before
the
aforesaid
officiator
,
the
two
swore
that
at
every
other
time
of
their
lives
till
death
took
them
,
they
would
assuredly
believe
,
feel
,
and
desire
precisely
as
they
had
believed
,
felt
,
and
desired
during
the
few
preceding
weeks
.
what
was
as
remarkable
as
the
undertaking
itself
was
the
fact
that
nobody
seemed
at
all
surprised
at
what
they
swore
.
fawley
'
s
aunt
being
a
baker
she
made
him
a
bride
-
cake
,
saying
bitterly
that
it
was
the
last
thing
she
could
do
for
him
,
poor
silly
fellow
;
and
that
it
would
have
been
far
better
if
,
instead
of
his
living
to
trouble
her
,
he
had
gone
underground
years
before
with
his
father
and
mother
.
of
this
cake
arabella
took
some
slices
,
wrapped
them
up
in
white
note
-
paper
,
and
sent
them
to
her
companions
in
the
pork
-
dressing
business
,
anny
and
sarah

labelling
each
packet

of
good

"
the
prospects
of
the
newly
married
couple
were
certainly
not
very
brilliant
even
to
the
most
sanguine
mind
.
he
,
a
stone
-
mason
'
s
apprentice
,
nineteen
years
of
age
,
was
working
for
half
wages
till
he
should
be
out
of
his
time
.
his
wife
was
absolutely
useless
in
a
town
-
lodging
,
where
he
at
first
had
considered
it
would
be
necessary
for
them
to
live
.
but
the
urgent
need
of
adding
to
income
in
ever
so
little
a
degree
caused
him
to
take
a
lonely
roadside
cottage
between
the
brown
house
and
marygreen
,
that
he
might
have
the
profits
of
a
vegetable
garden
,
and
utilize
her
past
experiences
by
letting
her
keep
a
pig
.
but
it
was
not
the
sort
of
life
he
had
bargained
for
,
and
it
was
a
long
way
to
walk
to
and
from
alfredston
every
day
.
arabella
,
however
,
felt
that
all
these
make
-
shifts
were
temporary
;
she
had
gained
a
husband
;
that
was
the
thing
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
husband
with
a
lot
of
earning
power
in
him
for
buying
her
frocks
and
hats
when
he
should
begin
to
get
frightened
a
bit
,
and
stick
to
his
trade
,
and
throw
aside
those
stupid
books
for
practical
undertakings
.
so
to
the
cottage
he
took
her
on
the
evening
of
the
marriage
,
giving
up
his
old
room
at
his
aunt
'

.

where
so
much
of
the
hard
labour
at
greek
and
latin
had
been
carried
on
.
a
little
chill
overspread
him
at
her
first
unrobing
.
a
long
tail
of
hair
,
which
arabella
wore
twisted
up
in
an
enormous
knob
at
the
back
of
her
head
,
was
deliberately
unfastened
,
stroked
out
,
and
hung
upon
the
looking
-
glass
which
he
had
bought
her
.
"

he

distaste
for
her
.

though
this
might
be
true
to
some
extent
,
for
all
that
he
knew
,
many
unsophisticated
girls
would
and
did
go
to
towns
and
remain
there
for
years
without
losing
their
simplicity
of
life
and
embellishments
.
others
,
alas
,
had
an
instinct
towards
artificiality
in
their
very
blood
,
and
became
adepts
in
counterfeiting
at
the
first
glimpse
of
it
.
however
,
perhaps
there
was
no
great
sin
in
a
woman
adding
to
her
hair
,
and
he
resolved
to
think
no
more
of
it
.
a
new

made
wife

usually
manage

excite
interest

a
few
weeks
,
even
though
the
prospects
of
the
house
-
hold
ways
and
means
are
cloudy
.
there
is
a
certain
piquancy
about
her
situation
,
and
her
manner
to
her
acquaintance
at
the
sense
of
it
,
which
carries
off
the
gloom
of
facts
,

renders
even
the
humblest
bride
independent

nevertheless
it
was
with
a
little
uneasiness
that
arabella
approached
the
time
when
in
the
natural
course
of
things
she
would
have
to
reveal
that
the
alarm
she
had
raised
had
been
without
foundation
.
the
occasion
was
one
evening
at
bedtime
,
and
they
were
in
their
chamber
in
the
lonely
cottage
by
the
wayside
to
which
jude
walked
home
from
his
work
every
day
.
he
had
worked
hard
the
whole
twelve
hours
,
and
had
retired
to
rest
before
his
wife
.
when
she
came
into
the
room
he
was
between
sleeping
and
waking
,
and
was
barely
conscious
of
her
undressing
before
the
little
looking
-
glass
as
he
lay
.
one
action
of
hers
,
however
,
brought
him
to
full
cognition
.
her
face
being
reflected
towards
him
as
she
sat
,
he
could
perceive
that
she
was
amusing
herself
by
artificially
producing
in
each
cheek
the
dimple
before
alluded
to
,
a
curious
accomplishment
of
which

to
him
,

dimly

something
wrong
in
a
social

made
necessary
a
cancelling

years

himself
superior

of
contributing
his
units
of
work
to
the
general
progress
of
his
generation
,
because
of
a
momentary
surprise
by
a
new
and
transitory
instinct
which
had
nothing
in
it
of
the
nature
of
vice
,

could
be
only
at

deserved
to

would
cripple
him

was
perhaps
something
fortunate

the
immediate

up
for
his
neglect

jude
felt
dissatisfied
with
himself
as
a
man
at
what
he
had
done
,
though
aware
of
his
lack
of
common
sense
,

that
the
deed
would
have
amounted
to
the

thing
if
carried
out

the
white
snow

stained
with
the
blood
of
his
fellow

mortal

an
illogical
look
to
him
as
a
lover
of
justice
,
not
to
say
a
christian
;
but
he
could
not
see
how
the
matter
was
to
be
mended
.
no
doubt
he
was
,
as
his
wife
had
called
him
,
a
tender
-
hearted
fool
.
he
did
not
like
the
road
to
alfredston
now
.
it
stared
him
cynically
in
the
face
.
the
wayside
objects
reminded
him
so
much
of
his
courtship
of
his
wife
that
,
to
keep
them
out
of
his
eyes
,
he
read
whenever
he
could
as
he
walked
to
and
from
his
work
.
yet
he
sometimes
felt
that
by
caring
for
books
he
was
not
escaping
common
-
place
nor
gaining
rare
ideas
,
every
working

man
being
of
that
taste
now

passing
near
the
spot
by

stream

he
had
first
made

one
day
heard

talking
to
a
friend
in
a
shed

himself
being
the
subject
of
discourse
,
possibly
because
they
had
seen
him
in
the
distance
.
they
were
quite
unaware
that
the
shed

walls
were
so
thin
that
he
could
hear
their
words
as
he
passed

the
suggestion
was
horridly
unpleasant
,

it
rankled
in
his
mind
so
much

instead
of
entering
his

cottage

he
reached
it
he
flung
his

aunt

there

been
out

delayed

dreading
lest

he
had
heard
should
lead
him
to
say
something
regrettable
to
her
he
spoke
little
.

arabella
was
very
talkative
,

said
among
other
things
that
she
wanted
some
money

seeing
the

sticking
out

added
