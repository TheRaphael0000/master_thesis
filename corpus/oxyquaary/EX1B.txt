when
my
father
reached
the
colony
for
which
he
had
left
england
some
twenty
-
two
years
previously
,
he
bought
a
horse
,
and
started
up
country
on
the
evening
of
the
day
after
his
arrival
,
which
was
,
as
i
have
said
,
on
one
of
the
last
days
of
november
1890
.
he
had
taken
an
english
saddle
with
him
,
and
a
couple
of
roomy
and
strongly
made
saddle
-
bags
.
in
these
he
packed
his
money
,
his
nuggets
,
some
tea
,
sugar
,
tobacco
,
salt
,
a
flask
of
brandy
,
matches
,
and
as
many
ship
'
s
biscuits
as
he
thought
he
was
likely
to
want
;
he
took
no
meat
,
for
he
could
supply
himself
from
some
accommodation
-
house
or
sheep
-
station
,
when
nearing
the
point
after
which
he
would
have
to
begin
camping
out
.
he
rolled
his
erewhonian
dress
and
small
toilette
necessaries
inside
a
warm
red
blanket
,
and
strapped
the
roll
on
to
the
front
part
of
his
saddle
.
on
to
other
d
'
s
,
with
which
his
saddle
was
amply
provided
,
he
strapped
his
erewhonian
boots
,
a
tin
pannikin
,
and
a
billy
that
would
hold
about
a
quart
.
i
should
,
perhaps
,
explain
to
english
readers
that
a
billy
is
a
tin
can
,
the
name
for
which
(
doubtless
of
french
canadian
origin
)
is
derived
from
the
words
"
faire
bouillir
.
"
he
also
took
with
him
a
pair
of
hobbles
and
a
small
hatchet
.
he
spent
three
whole
days
in
riding
across
the
plains
,
and
was
struck
with
the
very
small
signs
of
change
that
he
could
detect
,
but
the
fall
in
wool
,
and
the
failure
,
so
far
,
to
establish
a
frozen
meat
trade
,
had
prevented
any
material
development
of
the
resources
of
the
country
.
when
he
had
got
to
the
front
ranges
,
he
followed
up
the
river
next
to
the
north
of
the
one
that
he
had
explored
years
ago
,
and
from
the
head
waters
of
which
he
had
been
led
to
discover
the
only
practicable
pass
into
erewhon
.
he
did
this
,
partly
to
avoid
the
terribly
dangerous
descent
on
to
the
bed
of
the
more
northern
river
,
and
partly
to
escape
being
seen
by
shepherds
or
bullock
-
drivers
who
might
remember
him
.
if
he
had
attempted
to
get
through
the
gorge
of
this
river
in
1870
,
he
would
have
found
it
impassable
;
but
a
few
river
-
bed
flats
had
been
discovered
above
the
gorge
,
on
which
there
was
now
a
shepherd
'
s
hut
,
and
on
the
discovery
of
these
flats
a
narrow
horse
track
had
been
made
from
one
end
of
the
gorge
to
the
other
.
he
was
hospitably
entertained
at
the
shepherd
'
s
hut
just
mentioned
,
which
he
reached
on
monday
,
december
1
.
he
told
the
shepherd
in
charge
of
it
that
he
had
come
to
see
if
he
could
find
traces
of
a
large
wingless
bird
,
whose
existence
had
been
reported
as
having
been
discovered
among
the
extreme
head
waters
of
the
river
.
"
be
careful
,
sir
,
said
the
shepherd
;
"
the
river
is
very
dangerous
;
several
people
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
one
only
about
a
year
ago
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
have
left
this
hut
,
and
though
their
horses
and
their
camps
have
been
found
,
their
bodies
have
not
.
when
a
great
fresh
comes
down
,
it
would
carry
a
body
out
to
sea
in
twenty
-
four
hours
.
"
he
evidently
had
no
idea
that
there
was
a
pass
through
the
ranges
up
the
river
,
which
might
explain
the
disappearance
of
an
explorer
.
next
day
my
father
began
to
ascend
the
river
.
there
was
so
much
tangled
growth
still
unburnt
wherever
there
was
room
for
it
to
grow
,
and
so
much
swamp
,
that
my
father
had
to
keep
almost
entirely
to
the
river
-
bed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
here
there
was
a
good
deal
of
quicksand
.
the
stones
also
were
often
large
for
some
distance
together
,
and
he
had
to
cross
and
recross
streams
of
the
river
more
than
once
,
so
that
though
he
travelled
all
day
with
the
exception
of
a
couple
of
hours
for
dinner
,
he
had
not
made
more
than
some
five
and
twenty
miles
when
he
reached
a
suitable
camping
ground
,
where
he
unsaddled
his
horse
,
hobbled
him
,
and
turned
him
out
to
feed
.
the
grass
was
beginning
to
seed
,
so
that
though
it
was
none
too
plentiful
,
what
there
was
of
it
made
excellent
feed
.
he
lit
his
fire
,
made
himself
some
tea
,
ate
his
cold
mutton
and
biscuits
,
and
lit
his
pipe
,
exactly
as
he
had
done
twenty
years
before
.
there
was
the
clear
starlit
sky
,
the
rushing
river
,
and
the
stunted
trees
on
the
mountain
-
side
;
the
woodhens
cried
,
and
the
"
more
-
pork
"
hooted
out
her
two
monotonous
notes
exactly
as
they
had
done
years
since
;
one
moment
,
and
time
had
so
flown
backwards
that
youth
came
bounding
back
to
him
with
the
return
of
his
youth
'
s
surroundings
;
the
next
,
and
the
intervening
twenty
years
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
most
of
them
grim
ones
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
rose
up
mockingly
before
him
,
and
the
buoyancy
of
hope
yielded
to
the
despondency
of
admitted
failure
.
by
and
by
buoyancy
reasserted
itself
,
and
,
soothed
by
the
peace
and
beauty
of
the
night
,
he
wrapped
himself
up
in
his
blanket
and
dropped
off
into
a
dreamless
slumber
.
next
morning
,
i
.
e
.
december
3
,
he
rose
soon
after
dawn
,
bathed
in
a
backwater
of
the
river
,
got
his
breakfast
,
found
his
horse
on
the
river
-
bed
,
and
started
as
soon
as
he
had
duly
packed
and
loaded
.
he
had
now
to
cross
streams
of
the
river
and
recross
them
more
often
than
on
the
preceding
day
,
and
this
,
though
his
horse
took
well
to
the
water
,
required
care
;
for
he
was
anxious
not
to
wet
his
saddle
-
bags
,
and
it
was
only
by
crossing
at
the
wide
,
smooth
,
water
above
a
rapid
,
and
by
picking
places
where
the
river
ran
in
two
or
three
streams
,
that
he
could
find
fords
where
his
practised
eye
told
him
that
the
water
would
not
be
above
his
horse
'
s
belly
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
the
river
was
of
great
volume
.
fortunately
,
there
had
been
a
late
fall
of
snow
on
the
higher
ranges
,
and
the
river
was
,
for
the
summer
season
,
low
.
towards
evening
,
having
travelled
,
so
far
as
he
could
guess
,
some
twenty
or
five
and
twenty
miles
(
for
he
had
made
another
mid
day
halt
)
,
he
reached
the
place
,
which
he
easily
recognised
,
as
that
where
he
had
camped
before
crossing
to
the
pass
that
led
into
erewhon
.
it
was
the
last
piece
of
ground
that
could
be
called
a
flat
(
though
it
was
in
reality
only
the
sloping
delta
of
a
stream
that
descended
from
the
pass
)
before
reaching
a
large
glacier
that
had
encroached
on
the
river
-
bed
,
which
it
traversed
at
right
angles
for
a
considerable
distance
.
here
he
again
camped
,
hobbled
his
horse
,
and
turned
him
adrift
,
hoping
that
he
might
again
find
him
some
two
or
three
months
hence
,
for
there
was
a
good
deal
of
sweet
grass
here
and
there
,
with
sow
-
thistle
and
anise
;
and
the
coarse
tussock
grass
would
be
in
full
seed
shortly
,
which
alone
would
keep
him
going
for
as
long
a
time
as
my
father
expected
to
be
away
.
little
did
he
think
that
he
should
want
him
again
so
shortly
.
having
attended
to
his
horse
,
he
got
his
supper
,
and
while
smoking
his
pipe
congratulated
himself
on
the
way
in
which
something
had
smoothed
away
all
the
obstacles
that
had
so
nearly
baffled
him
on
his
earlier
journey
.
was
he
being
lured
on
to
his
destruction
by
some
malicious
fiend
,
or
befriended
by
one
who
had
compassion
on
him
and
wished
him
well
?
his
naturally
sanguine
temperament
inclined
him
to
adopt
the
friendly
spirit
theory
,
in
the
peace
of
which
he
again
laid
himself
down
to
rest
,
and
slept
soundly
from
dark
till
dawn
.
in
the
morning
,
though
the
water
was
somewhat
icy
,
he
again
bathed
,
and
then
put
on
his
erewhonian
boots
and
dress
.
he
stowed
his
european
clothes
,
with
some
difficulty
,
into
his
saddle
-
bags
.
herein
also
he
left
his
case
full
of
english
sovereigns
,
his
spare
pipes
,
his
purse
,
which
contained
two
pounds
in
gold
and
seven
or
eight
shillings
,
part
of
his
stock
of
tobacco
,
and
whatever
provision
was
left
him
,
except
the
meat
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
which
he
left
for
sundry
hawks
and
parrots
that
were
eyeing
his
proceedings
apparently
without
fear
of
man
.
his
nuggets
he
concealed
in
the
secret
pockets
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
,
keeping
one
bag
alone
accessible
.
he
had
had
his
hair
and
beard
cut
short
on
shipboard
the
day
before
he
landed
.
these
he
now
dyed
with
a
dye
that
he
had
brought
from
england
,
and
which
in
a
few
minutes
turned
them
very
nearly
black
.
he
also
stained
his
face
and
hands
deep
brown
.
he
hung
his
saddle
and
bridle
,
his
english
boots
,
and
his
saddle
-
bags
on
the
highest
bough
that
he
could
reach
,
and
made
them
fairly
fast
with
strips
of
flax
leaf
,
for
there
was
some
stunted
flax
growing
on
the
ground
where
he
had
camped
.
he
feared
that
,
do
what
he
might
,
they
would
not
escape
the
inquisitive
thievishness
of
the
parrots
,
whose
strong
beaks
could
easily
cut
leather
;
but
he
could
do
nothing
more
.
it
occurs
to
me
,
though
my
father
never
told
me
so
,
that
it
was
perhaps
with
a
view
to
these
birds
that
he
had
chosen
to
put
his
english
sovereigns
into
a
metal
box
,
with
a
clasp
to
it
which
would
defy
them
.
he
made
a
roll
of
his
blanket
,
and
slung
it
over
his
shoulder
;
he
also
took
his
pipe
,
tobacco
,
a
little
tea
,
a
few
ship
'
s
biscuits
,
and
his
billy
and
pannikin
;
matches
and
salt
go
without
saying
.
when
he
had
thus
ordered
everything
as
nearly
to
his
satisfaction
as
he
could
,
he
looked
at
his
watch
for
the
last
time
,
as
he
believed
,
till
many
weeks
should
have
gone
by
,
and
found
it
to
be
about
seven
o
'
clock
.
remembering
what
trouble
it
had
got
him
into
years
before
,
he
took
down
his
saddle
-
bags
,
reopened
them
,
and
put
the
watch
inside
.
he
then
set
himself
to
climb
the
mountain
side
,
towards
the
saddle
on
which
he
had
seen
the
statues
.
my
father
found
the
ascent
more
fatiguing
than
he
remembered
it
to
have
been
.
the
climb
,
he
said
,
was
steady
,
and
took
him
between
four
and
five
hours
,
as
near
as
he
could
guess
,
now
that
he
had
no
watch
;
but
it
offered
nothing
that
could
be
called
a
difficulty
,
and
the
watercourse
that
came
down
from
the
saddle
was
a
sufficient
guide
;
once
or
twice
there
were
waterfalls
,
but
they
did
not
seriously
delay
him
.
after
he
had
climbed
some
three
thousand
feet
,
he
began
to
be
on
the
alert
for
some
sound
of
ghostly
chanting
from
the
statues
;
but
he
heard
nothing
,
and
toiled
on
till
he
came
to
a
sprinkling
of
fresh
snow
.

part
of
the
fall
which
he
had
observed
on
the
preceding
day
as
having
whitened
the
higher
mountains
;
he
knew
,
therefore
,
that
he
must
now
be
nearing
the
saddle
.
the
snow
grew
rapidly
deeper
,
and
by
the
time
he
reached
the
statues
the
ground
was
covered
to
a
depth
of
two
or
three
inches
.
he
found
the
statues
smaller
than
he
had
expected
.
he
had
said
in
his
book
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
written
many
months
after
he
had
seen
them
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
they
were
about
six
times
the
size
of
life
,
but
he
now
thought
that
four
or
five
times
would
have
been
enough
to
say
.
their
mouths
were
much
clogged
with
snow
,
so
that
even
though
there
had
been
a
strong
wind
(
which
there
was
not
)
they
would
not
have
chanted
.
in
other
respects
he
found
them
not
less
mysteriously
impressive
than
at
first
.
he
walked
two
or
three
times
all
round
them
,
and
then
went
on
.
the
snow
did
not
continue
far
down
,
but
before
long
my
father
entered
a
thick
bank
of
cloud
,
and
had
to
feel
his
way
cautiously
along
the
stream
that
descended
from
the
pass
.
it
was
some
two
hours
before
he
emerged
into
clear
air
,
and
found
himself
on
the
level
bed
of
an
old
lake
now
grassed
over
.
he
had
quite
forgotten
this
feature
of
the
descent
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
perhaps
the
clouds
had
hung
over
it
;
he
was
overjoyed
,
however
,
to
find
that
the
flat
ground
abounded
with
a
kind
of
quail
,
larger
than
ours
,
and
hardly
,
if
at
all
,
smaller
than
a
partridge
.
the
abundance
of
these
quails
surprised
him
,
for
he
did
not
remember
them
as
plentiful
anywhere
on
the
erewhonian
side
of
the
mountains
.
the
erewhonian
quail
,
like
its
now
nearly
,
if
not
quite
,
extinct
new
zealand
congener
,
can
take
three
successive
flights
of
a
few
yards
each
,
but
then
becomes
exhausted
;
hence
quails
are
only
found
on
ground
that
is
never
burned
,
and
where
there
are
no
wild
animals
to
molest
them
;
the
cats
and
dogs
that
accompany
european
civilisation
soon
exterminate
them
;
my
father
,
therefore
,
felt
safe
in
concluding
that
he
was
still
far
from
any
village
.
moreover
he
could
see
no
sheep
or
goat
'
s
dung
;
and
this
surprised
him
,
for
he
thought
he
had
found
signs
of
pasturage
much
higher
than
this
.
doubtless
,
he
said
to
himself
,
when
he
wrote
his
book
he
had
forgotten
how
long
the
descent
had
been
.
but
it
was
odd
,
for
the
grass
was
good
feed
enough
,
and
ought
,
he
considered
,
to
have
been
well
stocked
.
tired
with
his
climb
,
during
which
he
had
not
rested
to
take
food
,
but
had
eaten
biscuits
,
as
he
walked
,
he
gave
himself
a
good
long
rest
,
and
when
refreshed
,
he
ran
down
a
couple
of
dozen
quails
,
some
of
which
he
meant
to
eat
when
he
camped
for
the
night
,
while
the
others
would
help
him
out
of
a
difficulty
which
had
been
troubling
him
for
some
time
.
what
was
he
to
say
when
people
asked
him
,
as
they
were
sure
to
do
,
how
he
was
living
?
and
how
was
he
to
get
enough
erewhonian
money
to
keep
him
going
till
he
could
find
some
safe
means
of
selling
a
few
of
his
nuggets
?
he
had
had
a
little
erewhonian
money
when
he
went
up
in
the
balloon
,
but
had
thrown
it
over
,
with
everything
else
except
the
clothes
he
wore
and
his
mss
.
,
when
the
balloon
was
nearing
the
water
.
he
had
nothing
with
him
that
he
dared
offer
for
sale
,
and
though
he
had
plenty
of
gold
,
was
in
reality
penniless
.
when
,
therefore
,
he
saw
the
quails
,
he
again
felt
as
though
some
friendly
spirit
was
smoothing
his
way
before
him
.
what
more
easy
than
to
sell
them
at
coldharbour
(
for
so
the
name
of
the
town
in
which
he
had
been
imprisoned
should
be
translated
)
,
where
he
knew
they
were
a
delicacy
,
and
would
fetch
him
the
value
of
an
english
shilling
a
piece
?
it
took
him
between
two
and
three
hours
to
catch
two
dozen
.
when
he
had
thus
got
what
he
considered
a
sufficient
stock
,
he
tied
their
legs
together
with
rushes
,
and
ran
a
stout
stick
through
the
whole
lot
.
soon
afterwards
he
came
upon
a
wood
of
stunted
pines
,
which
,
though
there
was
not
much
undergrowth
,
nevertheless
afforded
considerable
shelter
and
enabled
him
to
gather
wood
enough
to
make
himself
a
good
fire
.
this
was
acceptable
,
for
though
the
days
were
long
,
it
was
now
evening
,
and
as
soon
as
the
sun
had
gone
the
air
became
crisp
and
frosty
.
here
he
resolved
to
pass
the
night
.
he
chose
a
part
where
the
trees
were
thickest
,
lit
his
fire
,
plucked
and
cleaned
four
quails
,
filled
his
billy
with
water
from
the
stream
hard
by
,
made
tea
in
his
pannikin
,
grilled
two
of
his
birds
on
the
embers
,
ate
them
,
and
when
he
had
done
all
this
,
he
lit
his
pipe
and
began
to
think
things
over
.
"
so
far
so
good
,
"
said
he
to
himself
;
but
hardly
had
the
words
passed
through
his
mind
before
he
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
voices
,
still
at
some
distance
,
but
evidently
drawing
towards
him
.
he
instantly
gathered
up
his
billy
,
pannikin
,
tea
,
biscuits
,
and
blanket
,
all
of
which
he
had
determined
to
discard
and
hide
on
the
following
morning
;
everything
that
could
betray
him
he
carried
full
haste
into
the
wood
some
few
yards
off
,
in
the
direction
opposite
to
that
from
which
the
voices
were
coming
,
but
he
let
his
quails
lie
where
they
were
,
and
put
his
pipe
and
tobacco
in
his
pocket
.
the
voices
drew
nearer
and
nearer
,
and
it
was
all
my
father
could
do
to
get
back
and
sit
down
innocently
by
his
fire
,
before
he
could
hear
what
was
being
said
.
"
thank
goodness
,
"
said
one
of
the
speakers
(
of
course
in
the
erewhonian
language
)
,
"
we
seem
to
be
finding
somebody
at
last
.
i
hope
it
is
not
some
poacher
;
we
had
better
be
careful
.
"
"
nonsense
!
"
said
the
other
.
"
it
must
be
one
of
the
rangers
.
no
one
would
dare
to
light
a
fire
while
poaching
on
the
king
'
s
preserves
.
what
o
'
clock
do
you
make
it
?
"
"
half
after
nine
.
"
and
the
watch
was
still
in
the
speaker
'
s
hand
as
he
emerged
from
darkness
into
the
glowing
light
of
the
fire
.
my
father
glanced
at
it
,
and
saw
that
it
was
exactly
like
the
one
he
had
worn
on
entering
erewhon
nearly
twenty
years
previously
.
the
watch
,
however
,
was
a
very
small
matter
;
the
dress
of
these
two
men
(
for
there
were
only
two
)
was
far
more
disconcerting
.
they
were
not
in
the
erewhonian
costume
.
the
one
was
dressed
like
an
englishman
or
would
-
be
englishman
,
while
the
other
was
wearing
the
same
kind
of
clothes
but
turned
the
wrong
way
round
,
so
that
when
his
face
was
towards
my
father
his
body
seemed
to
have
its
back
towards
him
,
and
vice
verso
.
the
man
'
s
head
,
in
fact
,
appeared
to
have
been
screwed
right
round
;
and
yet
it
was
plain
that
if
he
were
stripped
he
would
be
found
built
like
other
people
.
what
could
it
all
mean
?
the
men
were
about
fifty
years
old
.
they
were
well
-
to
-
do
people
,
well
clad
,
well
fed
,
and
were
felt
instinctively
by
my
father
to
belong
to
the
academic
classes
.
that
one
of
them
should
be
dressed
like
a
sensible
englishman
dismayed
my
father
as
much
as
that
the
other
should
have
a
watch
,
and
look
as
if
he
had
just
broken
out
of
bedlam
,
or
as
king
dagobert
must
have
looked
if
he
had
worn
all
his
clothes
as
he
is
said
to
have
worn
his
breeches
.
both
wore
their
clothes
so
easily
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
for
he
who
wore
them
reversed
had
evidently
been
measured
with
a
view
to
this
absurd
fashion
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
it
was
plain
their
dress
was
habitual
.
my
father
was
alarmed
as
well
as
astounded
,
for
he
saw
that
what
little
plan
of
a
campaign
he
had
formed
must
be
reconstructed
,
and
he
had
no
idea
in
what
direction
his
next
move
should
be
taken
;
but
he
was
a
ready
man
,
and
knew
that
when
people
have
taken
any
idea
into
their
heads
,
a
little
confirmation
will
fix
it
.
a
first
idea
is
like
a
strong
seedling
;
it
will
grow
if
it
can
.
in
less
time
than
it
will
have
taken
the
reader
to
get
through
the
last
foregoing
paragraphs
,
my
father
took
up
the
cue
furnished
him
by
the
second
speaker
.
"
yes
,
"
said
he
,
going
boldly
up
to
this
gentleman
,
"
i
am
one
of
the
rangers
,
and
it
is
my
duty
to
ask
you
what
you
are
doing
here
upon
the
king
'
s
preserves
.
"
"
quite
so
,
my
man
,
"
was
the
rejoinder
.
"
we
have
been
to
see
the
statues
at
the
head
of
the
pass
,
and
have
a
permit
from
the
mayor
of
sunch
'
ston
to
enter
upon
the
preserves
.
we
lost
ourselves
in
the
thick
fog
,
both
going
and
coming
back
.
"
my
father
inwardly
blessed
the
fog
.
he
did
not
catch
the
name
of
the
town
,
but
presently
found
that
it
was
commonly
pronounced
as
i
have
written
it
.
"
be
pleased
to
show
it
me
,
"
said
my
father
in
his
politest
manner
.
on
this
a
document
was
handed
to
him
.
i
will
here
explain
that
i
shall
translate
the
names
of
men
and
places
,
as
well
as
the
substance
of
the
document
;
and
i
shall
translate
all
names
in
future
.
indeed
i
have
just
done
so
in
the
case
of
sunch
'
ston
.
as
an
example
,
let
me
explain
that
the
true
erewhonian
names
for
hanky
and
panky
,
to
whom
the
reader
will
be
immediately
introduced
,
are
sukoh
and
sukop
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
names
too
cacophonous
to
be
read
with
pleasure
by
the
english
public
.
i
must
ask
the
reader
to
believe
that
in
all
cases
i
am
doing
my
best
to
give
the
spirit
of
the
original
name
.
i
would
also
express
my
regret
that
my
father
did
not
either
uniformly
keep
to
the
true
erewhonian
names
,
as
in
the
cases
of
senoj
nosnibor
,
ydgrun
,
thims
,
&
c
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
names
which
occur
constantly
in
erewhon
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
or
else
invariably
invent
a
name
,
as
he
did
whenever
he
considered
the
true
name
impossible
.
my
poor
mother
'
s
name
,
for
example
,
was
really
nna
haras
,
and
mahaina
'
s
enaj
ysteb
,
which
he
dared
not
face
.
he
,
therefore
,
gave
these
characters
the
first
names
that
euphony
suggested
,
without
any
attempt
at
translation
.
rightly
or
wrongly
,
i
have
determined
to
keep
consistently
to
translation
for
all
names
not
used
in
my
father
'
s
book
;
and
throughout
,
whether
as
regards
names
or
conversations
,
i
shall
translate
with
the
freedom
without
which
no
translation
rises
above
construe
level
.

returned
it
to
the
one

had
given
it
him

a

he
said

sharply

for

doing
its
best
to
grow

he
says
nothing

my

inwardly

he
changed
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
,

said
stolidly
to
professor
hanky

"
i

you

be
right

thus
tenderly
did
he
water
the

'

second
seedling
.

panky
had
his
seedling
too
,

,
cain

like
,
was
jealous
that
hanky
'

should
flourish
while
his
own
was
withering
.
"
and
what
,
pray
,
my
man
,

he
said
somewhat
peremptorily
to
my
father
,
"
are
those
two
plucked
quails

?
were
you
to
deliver
them
plucked

what
bird
did
those
bones
belong
to

i
see
lying
by

fire
with
the
flesh
all
eaten
off

the
forbidden

'

quails
as
well

"
the
form
in
which
the
question
was
asked
gave
my
father
his
cue
.
he
laughed
heartily
,
and
said
,
"
why
,
sir
,
those
plucked
birds
are
landrails
,
not
quails

there
ever
a
quail

such
a
bone
as
that

"
i
cannot
say
whether
or
no
professor
panky
was
really
deceived
by
the
sweet
effrontery
with
which
my
father
proffered
him
the
bone
.
if
he
was
taken
in
,
his
answer
was
dictated
simply
by
a
donnish
unwillingness
to
allow
any
one
to
be
better
informed
on
any
subject
than
he
was
himself
.
my
father
,
when
i
suggested
this
to
him
,
would
not
hear
of
it
.
"
oh
no

he
said
;
"
the
man
knew
well
enough

was
lying

this
may
be
,
the
professor

manner
changed

he
said

were
landrail
bones

was
not
sure
till
i
had
one
in
my
hand
.
i
see
,
too
,
that
the
plucked
birds
are
landrails
,

there
is
little
light
,

i
have
not
often
seen
them
without
their
feathers

said
my

to
me

said
the
other
,
modulating
his
harsh
voice

it
was
quite
pleasant
.

my

saw
he

he
slipped
a
sum
equal
to
about
half

a

crown
into
my

hand

"

"
my
father
,
schooled
under
adversity
,
knew
that
it
was
never
well
to
press
advantage
too
far
.
he
took
the
equivalent
of
five
shillings
for
three
brace
,
which
was
somewhat
less
than
the
birds
would
have
been
worth
when
things
were
as
he
had
known
them
.
moreover
,
he
consented
to
take
a
shilling
'
s
worth
of
musical
bank
money
,
which
(
as
he
has
explained
in
his
book
)
has
no
appreciable
value
outside
these
banks
.
he
did
this
because
he
knew
that
it
would
be
respectable
to
be
seen
carrying
a
little
musical
bank
money
,
and
also
because
he
wished
to
give
some
of
it
to
the
british
museum
,
where
he
knew
that
this
curious
coinage
was
unrepresented
.
but
the
coins
struck
him
as
being
much
thinner
and
smaller
than
he
had
remembered
them
.
it
was
panky
,
not
hanky
,
who
had
given
him
the
musical
bank
money
.
panky
was
the
greater
humbug
of
the
two
,
for
he
would
humbug
even
himself
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
thing
,
by
the
way
,
not
very
hard
to
do
;
and
yet
he
was
the
less
successful
humbug
,
for
he
could
humbug
no
one
who
was
worth
humbugging
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
not
for
long
.
hanky
'
s
occasional
frankness
put
people
off
their
guard
.
he
was
the
mere
common
,
superficial
,
perfunctory
professor
,
who
,
being
a
professor
,
would
of
course
profess
,
but
would
not
lie
more
than
was
in
the
bond
;
he
was
log
-
rolled
and
log
-
rolling
,
but
still
,
in
a
robust
wolfish
fashion
,
human
.
panky
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
hardly
human
;
he
had
thrown
himself
so
earnestly
into
his
work
,
that
he
had
become
a
living
lie
.
if
he
had
had
to
play
the
part
of
othello
he
would
have
blacked
himself
all
over
,
and
very
likely
smothered
his
desdemona
in
good
earnest
.
hanky
would
hardly
have
blacked
himself
behind
the
ears
,
and
his
desdemona
would
have
been
quite
safe

philosophers
are
like
quails
in
the
respect
that
they
can
take
two
or
three
flights
of
imagination
,
but
rarely
more
without
an
interval
of
repose
.
the
professors
had
imagined
my
father
to
be
a
poacher
and
a

;
they
had
imagined
the
quails
to
be
wanted
for
sunday
'

had
imagined
that
they
imagined
(
at
least
panky
had
)
that
they
were
about
to
eat
landrails
;
they
were
now
exhausted
,
and
cowered
down
into
the
grass
of
their
ordinary
conversation
,
paying
no
more
attention
to
my
father
than
if
he
had
been
a
log
.
he
,
poor
man
,
drank
in
every
word
they
said
,
while
seemingly
intent
on
nothing
but
his
quails
,
each
one
of
which
he
cut
up
with
a
knife
borrowed
from
hanky
.
two
had
been
plucked
already
,
so
he
laid
these
at
once
upon
the
clear
embers

plain

"
again
groaned
my
father
inwardly
.
he
need
not
have
groaned
,
for
when
he
came
to
see
the
so
-
called
altar
-
piece
he
found
that
the
table
above
which
it
was
placed
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
altar
in
a
christian
church
.
it
was
a
mere
table
,
on
which
were
placed
two
bowls
full
of
musical
bank
coins
;
two
cashiers
,
who
sat
on
either
side
of
it
,
dispensed
a
few
of
these
to
all
comers
,
while
there
was
a
box
in
front
of
it
wherein
people
deposited
coin
of
the
realm
according
to
their
will
or
ability
.
the
idea
of
sacrifice
was
not
contemplated
,
and
the
position
of
the
table
,
as
well
as
the
name
given
to
it
,
was
an
instance
of
the
way
in
which
the
erewhonians
had
caught
names
and
practices
from
my
father
,
without
understanding
what
they
either
were
or
meant
.
so
,
again
,
when
professor
hanky
had
spoken
of
canonries
,
he
had
none
but
the
vaguest
idea
of
what
a
canonry
is
.
i
may
add
further
that
as
a
boy
my
father
had
had
his
bible
well
drilled
into
him
,
and
never
forgot
it
.
hence
biblical
passages
and
expressions
had
been
often
in
his
mouth
,
as
the
effect
of
mere
unconscious
cerebration
.
the
erewhonians
had
caught
many
of
these
,
sometimes
corrupting
them
so
that
they
were
hardly
recognizable
.
things
that
he
remembered
having
said
were
continually
meeting
him
during
the
few
days
of
his
second
visit
,
and
it
shocked
him
deeply
to
meet
some
gross
travesty
of
his
own
words
,
or
of
words
more
sacred
than
his
own
,
and
yet
to
be
unable
to
correct
it
.
"
i
wonder
,
"
he
said
to
me
,
"
that
no
one
has
ever
hit
on
this
as
a
punishment
for
the
damned
in
hades
.
"
let
me
now
return
to
professor
hanky
,
whom
i
fear
that
i
have
left
too
long
.
"
and
of
course
,
"
he
continued
,

pretty

had
worn
his

him

something

a
snort

him

dinner

was
still

way

matter

opinion

it

enough

the

allowed
the
question
to
remain
open

of
his
royal
professors

to
wear
the
clothes

hanky
warmly
.
on
this
the
two
professors
fell
out
,
and
the
discussion
grew
so
hot
that
my
father
interfered
by
advising
them
not
to
talk
so
loud
lest
another
ranger
should
hear
them
.
"

he
said
,
"

a
pause
,
"
it
is
very
strange
about

walked
round

impatiently

,
turning
to
my

quickly

"
now
my
father
by
this
time
was
wondering
whether
he
should
not
set
upon
these
two
men
,
kill
them
if
he
could
,

make
the
best

he
had
still
a
card
to
play

he
,

he
took
off
his
right
boot

handed
it
to
panky

now
,
mr
ranger
,
will
you
be
good
enough
to
explain
how
you
became
possessed
of
that
boot
.
you
need
not
show
me
the
other
.
"
and
he
spoke
like
an
examiner
who
was
confident
that
he
could
floor
his
examinee
in
viva
voce
.
"
you
know
our
orders
,
"
answered
my
father
,
"
you
have
seen
them
on
your
permit

i
met
one
of
those
foreign
devils
from
the
other
side
,
of
whom
we
have
had
more
than
one
lately
;
he
came
from
out
of
the
clouds
that
hang
higher
up
,
and
as
he
had
no
permit
and
could
not
speak
a
word
of
our
language
,
i
gripped
him
,
flung
him
,
and
strangled
him
.
thus
far
i
was
only
obeying
orders
,
but
seeing
how
much
better
his
boots
were
than
mine
,
and
finding
that
they
would
fit
me
,
i
resolved
to
keep
them
.
you
may
be
sure
i
should
not
have
done
so
if
i
had
known
there
was
snow
on
the
top
of
the
pass
.
"
"

could
not
invent
that
,
"
said
hanky
;
"
it
is
plain
he
has
not
been
up
to
the
statues
.
"
panky
was
staggered
.
"
and
of
course
,
"
said
he
ironically
,
"
you
took
nothing
from
this
poor
wretch
except
his
boots

"
"
sir
,
"
said
my
father
,
"
i
will
make
a
clean
breast
of
everything

i
flung
his
body
,
his
clothes
,
and
my
own
old
boots
into
the
pool
;
but
i
kept
his
blanket
,
some
things
he
used
for
cooking
,
and
some
strange
stuff
that
looks
like
dried
leaves
,
as
well
as
a
small
bag
of
something
which
i
believe
is
gold
.
i
thought
i
could
sell
the
lot
to
some
dealer
in
curiosities
who
would
ask
no
questions
.
"
"
and
what
,
pray
,
have
you
done
with
all
these
things
?
"
"
they
are
here
,
sir

"
and
as
he
spoke
he
dived
into
the
wood
,
returning
with
the
blanket
,
billy
,
pannikin
,
tea
,
and
the
little
bag
of
nuggets
,
which
he
had
kept
accessible
.
"
this
is
very
strange
,
"
said
hanky
,
who
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
of
my
father
when
he
learned
that
he
sometimes
killed
people
.
here
the
professors
talked
hurriedly
to
one
another
in
a
tongue
which
my
father
could
not
understand
,
but
which
he
felt
sure
was
the
hypothetical
language
of
which
he
has
spoken
in
his
book
.
presently
hanky
said
to
my
father
quite
civilly
,
"
and
what
,
my
good
man
,
do
you
propose
to
do
with
all
these
things
?
i
should
tell
you
at
once
that
what
you
take
to
be
gold
is
nothing
of
the
kind
;
it
is
a
base
metal
,
hardly
,
if
at
all
,
worth
more
than
copper
.
"
"
i
have
had
enough
of
them
;
to
-
morrow
morning
i
shall
take
them
with
me
to
the
blue
pool
,
and
drop
them
into
it
.
"
"
it
is
a
pity
you
should
do
that
,
"
said
hanky
musingly
:
"
the
things
are
interesting
as
curiosities
,
and
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and

.
.
.
.
.
.
and
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
what
will
you
take
for
them
?
"
"
i
could
not
do
it
,
sir
,
"
answered
my
father
.
"
i
would
not
do
it
,
no
,
not
for
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
"
and
he
named
a
sum
equivalent
to
about
five
pounds
of
our
money
.
for
he
wanted
erewhonian
money
,
and
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
sacrifice
his
ten
pounds
'
worth
of
nuggets
in
order
to
get
a
supply
of
current
coin
.
hanky
tried
to
beat
him
down
,
assuring
him
that
no
curiosity
dealer
would
give
half
as
much
,
and
my
father
so
far
yielded
as
to
take
4
pounds
,
10s
.
in
silver
,
which
,
as
i
have
already
explained
,
would
not
be
worth
more
than
half
a
sovereign
in
gold
.
at
this
figure
a
bargain
was
struck
,
and
the
professors
paid
up
without
offering
him
a
single
musical
bank
coin
.
they
wanted
to
include
the
boots
in
the
purchase
,
but
here
my
father
stood
out
.
but
he
could
not
stand
out
as
regards
another
matter
,
which
caused
him
some
anxiety
.
panky
insisted
that
my
father
should
give
them
a
receipt
for
the
money
,
and
there
was
an
altercation
between
the
professors
on
this
point
,
much
longer
than
i
can
here
find
space
to
give
.
hanky
argued
that
a
receipt
was
useless
,
inasmuch
as
it
would
be
ruin
to
my
father
ever
to
refer
to
the
subject
again
.
panky
,
however
,
was
anxious
,
not
lest
my
father
should
again
claim
the
money
,
but
(
though
he
did
not
say
so
outright
)
lest
hanky
should
claim
the
whole
purchase
as
his
own
.
in
so
the
end
panky
,
for
a
wonder
,
carried
the
day
,
and
a
receipt
was
drawn
up
to
the
effect
that
the
undersigned
acknowledged
to
have
received
from
professors
hanky
and
panky
the
sum
of
4
pounds
,
10s
.
(
i
translate
the
amount
)
,
as
joint
purchasers
of
certain
pieces
of
yellow
ore
,
a
blanket
,

sundry
articles
found
without
an
owner

my
father
,
generally
so
ready
,
was
at
his
wits
'
end
for
a
name
,
and
could
think
of
none

mr

that

a
name
common
enough

signed

hanky
contemptuously
;

into
the
bag
it
was
put
.
when
all
was
now
concluded
,
my
father
laughingly
said
,
"

dealt
unfairly

forgive

my
motto

trespass
against
us

"

last
words

"
said
panky
eagerly
.
my
father
was
alarmed
at
his
manner
,
but
thought
it
safer
to
repeat
them
.
"
you
hear
that
,
hanky
?
i
am
convinced
;
i
have
not
another
word
to
say
.
the
man
is
a
true
erewhonian
;

has
our
corrupt
reading
of
the
sunchild

prayer

"
"
please
explain

"
"

you
not
see

"
said
panky
,
who
was
by
way
of
being
great
at
conjectural
emendations
.
"
can
you
not
see
how
impossible
it
is
for
the
sunchild
,
or
any
of
the
people
to
whom
he
declared
(
as
we
now
know
provisionally
)
that
he
belonged
,
could
have
made
the
forgiveness
of
his
own
sins
depend
on
the
readiness
with
which
he
forgave
other
people
?
no
man
in
his
senses
would
dream
of
such
a
thing
.
it
would
be
asking
a
supposed
all
-
powerful
being
not
to
forgive
his
sins
at
all
,
or
at
best
to
forgive
them
imperfectly

yram
got
it
wrong

she
mistook

do
not
'
for

as
we
.
'
the
sound
of
the
words
is
very
much
alike
;
the
correct
reading
should
obviously
be
,
'
forgive
us
our
trespasses
,
but
do
not
forgive
them
that
trespass
against
us
.
'
this
makes
sense
,
and
turns
an
impossible
prayer
into
one
that
goes
straight
to
the
heart
of
every
one
of
us
.
"
then
,
turning
to
my
father
,
he
said
,
"

saw
it
now
,

had
always
heard
the
words

he
had
himself
spoken
them

undertone

said
my
father
,
"
the
moon
is
risen
.
i
must
be
after
the
quails
at
day
-
break
;
i
will
therefore
go
to
the
ranger
'
s
shelter
"
(
a
shelter
,
by
the
way
,
which
existed
only
in
my
father
'
s
invention
)
,
"
and
get
a
couple
of
hours
'
sleep
,
so
as
to
be
both
close
to
the
quail
-
ground
;
and
fresh
for
running
.
you
are
so
near
the
boundary
of
the
preserves
that
you
will
not
want
your
permit
further
;
no
one
will
meet
you
,
and
should
any
one
do
so
,
you
need
only
give
your
names
and
say
that
you
have
made
a
mistake
.
you
will
have
to
give
it
up
to
-
morrow
at
the
ranger
'
s
office
;
it
will
save
you
trouble
if
i
collect
it
now
,
and
give
it
up
when
i
deliver
my
quails
.
"
as
regards
the
curiosities
,
hide
them
as
you
best
can
outside
the
limits
.
i
recommend
you
to
carry
them
at
once
out
of
the
forest
,
and
rest
beyond
the
limits
rather
than
here
.
you
can
then
recover
them
whenever
,
and
in
whatever
way
,
you
may
find
convenient
.
but
i
hope
you
will
say
nothing
about
any
foreign
devil
'
s
having
come
over
on
to
this
side
.
any
whisper
to
this
effect
unsettles
people
'
s
minds
,
and
they
are
too
much
unsettled
already
;
hence
our
orders
to
kill
any
one
from
over
there
at
once
,
and
to
tell
no
one
but
the
head
ranger
.
i
was
forced
by
you
,
gentlemen
,
to
disobey
these
orders
in
self
-
defence
;
i
must
trust
your
generosity
to
keep
what
i
have
told
you
secret
.
i
shall
,
of
course
,
report
it
to
the
head
ranger
.
and
now
,
if
you
think
proper
,
you
can
give
me
up
your
permit
.
"
all
this
was
so
plausible
that
the
professors
gave
up
their
permit
without
a
word
but
thanks
.
they
bundled
their
curiosities
hurriedly
into
"
the
poor
foreign
devil
'
s
"
blanket
,
reserving
a
more
careful
packing
till
they
were
out
of
the
preserves
.
they
wished
my
father
a
very
good
night
,
and
all
success
with
his
quails
in
the
morning
;
they
thanked
him
again
for
the
care
he
had
taken
of
them
in
the
matter
of
the
landrails
,
and
panky
even
went
so
far
as
to
give
him
a
few
musical
bank
coins
,
which
he
gratefully
accepted
.
they
then
started
off
in
the
direction
of
sunch
'
ston
.
my
father
gathered
up
the
remaining
quails
,
some
of
which
he
meant
to
eat
in
the
morning
,
while
the
others
he
would
throw
away
as
soon
as
he
could
find
a
safe
place
.
he
turned
towards
the
mountains
,
but
before
he
had
gone
a
dozen
yards
he
heard
a
voice
,
which
he
recognised
as
panky
'
s
,
shouting
after
him
,
and
saying
-
"
mind
you
do
not
forget
the
true
reading
of
the
sunchild
'
s
prayer
.
"
"
you
are
an
old
fool
,
"
shouted
my
father
in
english
,
knowing
that
he
could
hardly
be
heard
,
still
less
understood
,
and
thankful
to
relieve
his
feelings
.
the
incidents
recorded
in
the
two
last
chapters
had
occupied
about
two
hours
,
so
that
it
was
nearly
midnight
before
my
father
could
begin
to
retrace
his
steps
and
make
towards
the
camp
that
he
had
left
that
morning
.
this
was
necessary
,
for
he
could
not
go
any
further
in
a
costume
that
he
now
knew
to
be
forbidden
.
at
this
hour
no
ranger
was
likely
to
meet
him
before
he
reached
the
statues
,
and
by
making
a
push
for
it
he
could
return
in
time
to
cross
the
limits
of
the
preserves
before
the
professors
'
permit
had
expired
.
if
challenged
,
he
must
brazen
it
out
that
he
was
one
or
other
of
the
persons
therein
named
.
fatigued
though
he
was
,
he
reached
the
statues
as
near
as
he
could
guess
,
at
about
three
in
the
morning
.
what
little
wind
there
had
been
was
warm
,
so
that
the
tracks
,
which
the
professors
must
have
seen
shortly
after
he
had
made
them
,
had
disappeared
.
the
statues
looked
very
weird
in
the
moonlight
but
they
were
not
chanting
.
while
ascending
,
he
pieced
together
the
information
he
had
picked
up
from
the
professors
.
plainly
,
the
sunchild
,
or
child
of
the
sun
,
was
none
other
than
himself
,
and
the
new
name
of
coldharbour
was
doubtless
intended
to
commemorate
the
fact
that
this
was
the
first
town
he
had
reached
in
erewhon
.
plainly
,
also
,
he
was
supposed
to
be
of
superhuman
origin
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
his
flight
in
the
balloon
having
been
not
unnaturally
believed
to
be
miraculous
.
the
erewhonians
had
for
centuries
been
effacing
all
knowledge
of
their
former
culture
;
archaeologists
,
indeed
,
could
still
glean
a
little
from
museums
,
and
from
volumes
hard
to
come
by
,
and
still
harder
to
understand
;
but
archaeologists
were
few
,
and
even
though
they
had
made
researches
(
which
they
may
or
may
not
have
done
)
,
their
labours
had
never
reached
the
masses
.
what
wonder
,
then
,
that
the
mushroom
spawn
of
myth
,
ever
present
in
an
atmosphere
highly
charged
with
ignorance
,
had
germinated
in
a
soil
so
favourably
prepared
for
its
reception
?
he
saw
it
all
now
.
it
was
twenty
years
next
sunday
since
he
and
my
mother
had
eloped
.
that
was
the
meaning
of
xix
.
xii
.
29
.
they
had
made
a
new
era
,
dating
from
the
day
of
his
return
to
the
palace
of
the
sun
with
a
bride
who
was
doubtless
to
unite
the
erewhonian
nature
with
that
of
the
sun
.
the
new
year
,
then
,
would
date
from
sunday
,
december
7
,
which
would
therefore
become
xx
.
i
.
1
.
the
thursday
,
now
nearly
if
not
quite
over
,
being
only
two
days
distant
from
the
end
of
a
month
of
thirty
-
one
days
,
which
was
also
the
last
of
the
year
,
would
be
xix
.
xii
.
29
,
as
on
the
professors
'
permit
.
i
should
like
to
explain
here
what
will
appear
more
clearly
on
a
later
page
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
mean
,
that
the
erewhonians
,
according
to
their
new
system
,
do
not
believe
the
sun
to
be
a
god
except
as
regards
this
world
and
his
other
planets
.
my
father
had
told
them
a
little
about
astronomy
,
and
had
assured
them
that
all
the
fixed
stars
were
suns
like
our
own
,
with
planets
revolving
round
them
,
which
were
probably
tenanted
by
intelligent
living
beings
,
however
unlike
they
might
be
to
ourselves
.
from
this
they
evolved
the
theory
that
the
sun
was
the
ruler
of
this
planetary
system
,
and
that
he
must
be
personified
,
as
they
had
personified
the
air
-
god
,
the
gods
of
time
and
space
,
hope
,
justice
,
and
the
other
deities
mentioned
in
my
father
'
s
book
.
they
retain
their
old
belief
in
the
actual
existence
of
these
gods
,
but
they
now
make
them
all
subordinate
to
the
sun
.
the
nearest
approach
they
make
to
our
own
conception
of
god
is
to
say
that
he
is
the
ruler
over
all
the
suns
throughout
the
universe
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
the
suns
being
to
him
much
as
our
planets
and
their
denizens
are
to
our
own
sun
.
they
deny
that
he
takes
more
interest
in
one
sun
and
its
system
than
in
another
.
all
the
suns
with
their
attendant
planets
are
supposed
to
be
equally
his
children
,
and
he
deputes
to
each
sun
the
supervision
and
protection
of
its
own
system
.
hence
they
say
that
though
we
may
pray
to
the
air
-
god
,
&
c
.
,
and
even
to
the
sun
,
we
must
not
pray
to
god
.
we
may
be
thankful
to
him
for
watching
over
the
suns
,
but
we
must
not
go
further
.
going
back
to
my
father
'
s
reflections
,
he
perceived
that
the
erewhonians
had
not
only
adopted
our
calendar
,
as
he
had
repeatedly
explained
it
to
the
nosnibors
,
but
had
taken
our
week
as
well
,
and
were
making
sunday
a
high
day
,
just
as
we
do
.
next
sunday
,
in
commemoration
of
the
twentieth
year
after
his
ascent
,
they
were
about
to
dedicate
a
temple
to
him
;
in
this
there
was
to
be
a
picture
showing
himself
and
his
earthly
bride
on
their
heavenward
journey
,
in
a
chariot
drawn
by
four
black
and
white
horses
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
which
,
however
,
professor
hanky
had
positively
affirmed
to
have
been
only
storks
.
here
i
interrupted
my
father
.
"
but
were
there
,
"
i
said
,
"
any
storks
?
"
"
yes
,
"
he
answered
.
"
as
soon
as
i
heard
hanky
'
s
words
i
remembered
that
a
flight
of
some
four
or
five
of
the
large
storks
so
common
in
erewhon
during
the
summer
months
had
been
wheeling
high
aloft
in
one
of
those
aerial
dances
that
so
much
delight
them
.
i
had
quite
forgotten
it
,
but
it
came
back
to
me
at
once
that
these
creatures
,
attracted
doubtless
by
what
they
took
to
be
an
unknown
kind
of
bird
,
swooped
down
towards
the
balloon
and
circled
round
it
like
so
many
satellites
to
a
heavenly
body
.
i
was
fearful
lest
they
should
strike
at
it
with
their
long
and
formidable
beaks
,
in
which
case
all
would
have
been
soon
over
;
either
they
were
afraid
,
or
they
had
satisfied
their
curiosity
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
at
any
rate
,
they
let
us
alone
;
but
they
kept
with
us
till
we
were
well
away
from
the
capital
.
strange
,
how
completely
this
incident
had
escaped
me
.
"
i
return
to
my
father
'
s
thoughts
as
he
made
his
way
back
to
his
old
camp
.
as
for
the
reversed
position
of
professor
panky
'
s
clothes
,
he
remembered
having
given
his
own
