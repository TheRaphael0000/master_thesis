sometimes
i
am
rewarded
for
fretting
myself
so
much
about
present
matters
by
a
quite
unasked
-
for
pleasant
dream
.
i
mean
when
i
am
asleep
.
this
dream
is
as
it
were
a
present
of
an
architectural
peep
-
show
.
i
see
some
beautiful
and
noble
building
new
made
,
as
it
were
for
the
occasion
,
as
clearly
as
if
i
were
awake
;
not
vaguely
or
absurdly
,
as
often
happens
in
dreams
,
but
with
all
the
detail
clear
and
reasonable
.
some
elizabethan
house
with
its
scrap
of
earlier
fourteenth
-
century
building
,
and
its
later
degradations
of
queen
anne
and
silly
billy
and
victoria
,
marring
but
not
destroying
it
,
in
an
old
village
once
a
clearing
amid
the
sandy
woodlands
of
sussex
.
or
an
old
and
unusually
curious
church
,
much
churchwardened
,
and
beside
it
a
fragment
of
fifteenth
-
century
domestic
architecture
amongst
the
not
unpicturesque
lath
and
plaster
of
an
essex
farm
,
and
looking
natural
enough
among
the
sleepy
elms
and
the
meditative
hens
scratching
about
in
the
litter
of
the
farmyard
,
whose
trodden
yellow
straw
comes
up
to
the
very
jambs
of
the
richly
carved
norman
doorway
of
the
church
.
or
sometimes
'
tis
a
splendid
collegiate
church
,
untouched
by
restoring
parson
and
architect
,
standing
amid
an
island
of
shapely
trees
and
flower
-
beset
cottages
of
thatched
grey
stone
and
cob
,
amidst
the
narrow
stretch
of
bright
green
water
-
meadows
that
wind
between
the
sweeping
wiltshire
downs
,
so
well
beloved
of
william
cobbett
.
or
some
new
-
seen
and
yet
familiar
cluster
of
houses
in
a
grey
village
of
the
upper
thames
overtopped
by
the
delicate
tracery
of
a
fourteenth
-
century
church
;
or
even
sometimes
the
very
buildings
of
the
past
untouched
by
the
degradation
of
the
sordid
utilitarianism
that
cares
not
and
knows
not
of
beauty
and
history
:
as
once
,
when
i
was
journeying
(
in
a
dream
of
the
night
)
down
the
well
-
remembered
reaches
of
the
thames
betwixt
streatley
and
wallingford
,
where
the
foothills
of
the
white
horse
fall
back
from
the
broad
stream
,
i
came
upon
a
clear
-
seen
mediaeval
town
standing
up
with
roof
and
tower
and
spire
within
its
walls
,
grey
and
ancient
,
but
untouched
from
the
days
of
its
builders
of
old
.
all
this
i
have
seen
in
the
dreams
of
the
night
clearer
than
i
can
force
myself
to
see
them
in
dreams
of
the
day
.
so
that
it
would
have
been
nothing
new
to
me
the
other
night
to
fall
into
an
architectural
dream
if
that
were
all
,
and
yet
i
have
to
tell
of
things
strange
and
new
that
befell
me
after
i
had
fallen
asleep
.
i
had
begun
my
sojourn
in
the
land
of
nod
by
a
very
confused
attempt
to
conclude
that
it
was
all
right
for
me
to
have
an
engagement
to
lecture
at
manchester
and
mitcham
fair
green
at
half
-
past
eleven
at
night
on
one
and
the
same
sunday
,
and
that
i
could
manage
pretty
well
.
and
then
i
had
gone
on
to
try
to
make
the
best
of
addressing
a
large
open
-
air
audience
in
the
costume
i
was
really
then
wearing
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
to
wit
,
my
night
-
shirt
,
reinforced
for
the
dream
occasion
by
a
pair
of
braceless
trousers
.
the
consciousness
of
this
fact
so
bothered
me
,
that
the
earnest
faces
of
my
audience
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
who
would
not
notice
it
,
but
were
clearly
preparing
terrible
anti
-
socialist
posers
for
me
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
began
to
fade
away
and
my
dream
grew
thin
,
and
i
awoke
(
as
i
thought
)
to
find
myself
lying
on
a
strip
of
wayside
waste
by
an
oak
copse
just
outside
a
country
village
.
i
got
up
and
rubbed
my
eyes
and
looked
about
me
,
and
the
landscape
seemed
unfamiliar
to
me
,
though
it
was
,
as
to
the
lie
of
the
land
,
an
ordinary
english
low
-
country
,
swelling
into
rising
ground
here
and
there
.
the
road
was
narrow
,
and
i
was
convinced
that
it
was
a
piece
of
roman
road
from
its
straightness
.
copses
were
scattered
over
the
country
,
and
there
were
signs
of
two
or
three
villages
and
hamlets
in
sight
besides
the
one
near
me
,
between
which
and
me
there
was
some
orchard
-
land
,
where
the
early
apples
were
beginning
to
redden
on
the
trees
.
also
,
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
the
ditch
which
ran
along
it
,
was
a
small
close
of
about
a
quarter
of
an
acre
,
neatly
hedged
with
quick
,
which
was
nearly
full
of
white
poppies
,
and
,
as
far
as
i
could
see
for
the
hedge
,
had
also
a
good
few
rose
-
bushes
of
the
bright
-
red
nearly
single
kind
,
which
i
had
heard
are
the
ones
from
which
rose
-
water
used
to
be
distilled
.
otherwise
the
land
was
quite
unhedged
,
but
all
under
tillage
of
various
kinds
,
mostly
in
small
strips
.
from
the
other
side
of
a
copse
not
far
off
rose
a
tall
spire
white
and
brand
-
new
,
but
at
once
bold
in
outline
and
unaffectedly
graceful
and
also
distinctly
english
in
character
.
this
,
together
with
the
unhedged
tillage
and
a
certain
unwonted
trimness
and
handiness
about
the
enclosures
of
the
garden
and
orchards
,
puzzled
me
for
a
minute
or
two
,
as
i
did
not
understand
,
new
as
the
spire
was
,
how
it
could
have
been
designed
by
a
modern
architect
;
and
i
was
of
course
used
to
the
hedged
tillage
and
tumbledown
bankrupt
-
looking
surroundings
of
our
modern
agriculture
.
so
that
the
garden
-
like
neatness
and
trimness
of
everything
surprised
me
.
but
after
a
minute
or
two
that
surprise
left
me
entirely
;
and
if
what
i
saw
and
heard
afterwards
seems
strange
to
you
,
remember
that
it
did
not
seem
strange
to
me
at
the
time
,
except
where
now
and
again
i
shall
tell
you
of
it
.
also
,
once
for
all
,
if
i
were
to
give
you
the
very
words
of
those
who
spoke
to
me
you
would
scarcely
understand
them
,
although
their
language
was
english
too
,
and
at
the
time
i
could
understand
them
at
once
.
well
,
as
i
stretched
myself
and
turned
my
face
toward
the
village
,
i
heard
horse
-
hoofs
on
the
road
,
and
presently
a
man
and
horse
showed
on
the
other
end
of
the
stretch
of
road
and
drew
near
at
a
swinging
trot
with
plenty
of
clash
of
metal
.
the
man
soon
came
up
to
me
,
but
paid
me
no
more
heed
than
throwing
me
a
nod
.
he
was
clad
in
armour
of
mingled
steel
and
leather
,
a
sword
girt
to
his
side
,
and
over
his
shoulder
a
long
-
handled
bill
-
hook
.
his
armour
was
fantastic
in
form
and
well
wrought
;
but
by
this
time
i
was
quite
used
to
the
strangeness
of
him
,
and
merely
muttered
to
myself
,
"
he
is
coming
to
summon
the
squire
to
the
leet
;
"
so
i
turned
toward
the
village
in
good
earnest
.
nor
,
again
,
was
i
surprised
at
my
own
garments
,
although
i
might
well
have
been
from
their
unwontedness
.
i
was
dressed
in
a
black
cloth
gown
reaching
to
my
ankles
,
neatly
embroidered
about
the
collar
and
cuffs
,
with
wide
sleeves
gathered
in
at
the
wrists
;
a
hood
with
a
sort
of
bag
hanging
down
from
it
was
on
my
head
,
a
broad
red
leather
girdle
round
my
waist
,
on
one
side
of
which
hung
a
pouch
embroidered
very
prettily
and
a
case
made
of
hard
leather
chased
with
a
hunting
scene
,
which
i
knew
to
be
a
pen
and
ink
case
;
on
the
other
side
a
small
sheath
-
knife
,
only
an
arm
in
case
of
dire
necessity
.
well
,
i
came
into
the
village
,
where
i
did
not
see
(
nor
by
this
time
expected
to
see
)
a
single
modern
building
,
although
many
of
them
were
nearly
new
,
notably
the
church
,
which
was
large
,
and
quite
ravished
my
heart
with
its
extreme
beauty
,
elegance
,
and
fitness
.
the
chancel
of
this
was
so
new
that
the
dust
of
the
stone
still
lay
white
on
the
midsummer
grass
beneath
the
carvings
of
the
windows
.
the
houses
were
almost
all
built
of
oak
frame
-
work
filled
with
cob
or
plaster
well
whitewashed
;
though
some
had
their
lower
stories
of
rubble
-
stone
,
with
their
windows
and
doors
of
well
-
moulded
freestone
.
there
was
much
curious
and
inventive
carving
about
most
of
them
;
and
though
some
were
old
and
much
worn
,
there
was
the
same
look
of
deftness
and
trimness
,
and
even
beauty
,
about
every
detail
in
them
which
i
noticed
before
in
the
field
-
work
.
they
were
all
roofed
with
oak
shingles
,
mostly
grown
as
grey
as
stone
;
but
one
was
so
newly
built
that
its
roof
was
yet
pale
and
yellow
.
this
was
a
corner
house
,
and
the
corner
post
of
it
had
a
carved
niche
wherein
stood
a
gaily
painted
figure
holding
an
anchor
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
st
.
clement
to
wit
,
as
the
dweller
in
the
house
was
a
blacksmith
.
half
a
stone
'
s
throw
from
the
east
end
of
the
churchyard
wall
was
a
tall
cross
of
stone
,
new
like
the
church
,
the
head
beautifully
carved
with
a
crucifix
amidst
leafage
.
it
stood
on
a
set
of
wide
stone
steps
,
octagonal
in
shape
,
where
three
roads
from
other
villages
met
and
formed
a
wide
open
space
on
which
a
thousand
people
or
more
could
stand
together
with
no
great
crowding
.
all
this
i
saw
,
and
also
that
there
was
a
goodish
many
people
about
,
women
and
children
,
and
a
few
old
men
at
the
doors
,
many
of
them
somewhat
gaily
clad
,
and
that
men
were
coming
into
the
village
street
by
the
other
end
to
that
by
which
i
had
entered
,
by
twos
and
threes
,
most
of
them
carrying
what
i
could
see
were
bows
in
cases
of
linen
yellow
with
wax
or
oil
;
they
had
quivers
at
their
backs
,
and
most
of
them
a
short
sword
by
their
left
side
,
and
a
pouch
and
knife
on
the
right
;
they
were
mostly
dressed
in
red
or
brightish
green
or
blue
cloth
jerkins
,
with
a
hood
on
the
head
generally
of
another
colour
.
as
they
came
nearer
i
saw
that
the
cloth
of
their
garments
was
somewhat
coarse
,
but
stout
and
serviceable
.
i
knew
,
somehow
,
that
they
had
been
shooting
at
the
butts
,
and
,
indeed
,
i
could
still
hear
a
noise
of
men
thereabout
,
and
even
now
and
again
when
the
wind
set
from
that
quarter
the
twang
of
the
bowstring
and
the
plump
of
the
shaft
in
the
target
.
i
leaned
against
the
churchyard
wall
and
watched
these
men
,
some
of
whom
went
straight
into
their
houses
and
some
loitered
about
still
;
they
were
rough
-
looking
fellows
,
tall
and
stout
,
very
black
some
of
them
,
and
some
red
-
haired
,
but
most
had
hair
burnt
by
the
sun
into
the
colour
of
tow
;
and
,
indeed
,
they
were
all
burned
and
tanned
and
freckled
variously
.
their
arms
and
buckles
and
belts
and
the
finishings
and
hems
of
their
garments
were
all
what
we
should
now
call
beautiful
,
rough
as
the
men
were
;
nor
in
their
speech
was
any
of
that
drawling
snarl
or
thick
vulgarity
which
one
is
used
to
hear
from
labourers
in
civilisation
;
not
that
they
talked
like
gentlemen
either
,
but
full
and
round
and
bold
,
and
they
were
merry
and
good
-
tempered
enough
;
i
could
see
that
,
though
i
felt
shy
and
timid
amongst
them
.
one
of
them
strode
up
to
me
across
the
road
,
a
man
some
six
feet
high
,
with
a
short
black
beard
and
black
eyes
and
berry
-
brown
skin
,
with
a
huge
bow
in
his
hand
bare
of
the
case
,
a
knife
,
a
pouch
,
and
a
short
hatchet
,
all
clattering
together
at
his
girdle
.
"
well
,
friend
,
"
said
he
,
"
thou
lookest
partly
mazed
;
what
tongue
hast
thou
in
thine
head
?
"
"
a
tongue
that
can
tell
rhymes
,
"
said
i
.
"
so
i
thought
,
"
said
he
.
"
thirstest
thou
any
?
"
"
yea
,
and
hunger
,
"
said
i
.
and
therewith
my
hand
went
into
my
purse
,
and
came
out
again
with
but
a
few
small
and
thin
silver
coins
with
a
cross
stamped
on
each
,
and
three
pellets
in
each
corner
of
the
cross
.
the
man
grinned
.
"
aha
!
"
said
he
,
"
is
it
so
?
never
heed
it
,
mate
.
it
shall
be
a
song
for
a
supper
this
fair
sunday
evening
.
but
first
,
whose
man
art
thou
?
"
"
no
one
'
s
man
,
"
said
i
,
reddening
angrily
;
"
i
am
my
own
master
.
"
he
grinned
again
.
"
nay
,
that
'
s
not
the
custom
of
england
,
as
one
time
belike
it
will
be
.
methinks
thou
comest
from
heaven
down
,
and
hast
had
a
high
place
there
too
.
"
he
seemed
to
hesitate
a
moment
,
and
then
leant
forward
and
whispered
in
my
ear
:
"
john
the
miller
,
that
ground
small
,
small
,
small
,
"
and
stopped
and
winked
at
me
,
and
from
between
my
lips
without
my
mind
forming
any
meaning
came
the
words
,
"
the
king
'
s
son
of
heaven
shall
pay
for
all
.
"
he
let
his
bow
fall
on
to
his
shoulder
,
caught
my
right
hand
in
his
and
gave
it
a
great
grip
,
while
his
left
hand
fell
among
the
gear
at
his
belt
,
and
i
could
see
that
he
half
drew
his
knife
.
"
well
,
brother
,
"
said
he
,
"
stand
not
here
hungry
in
the
highway
when
there
is
flesh
and
bread
in
the
rose
yonder
.
come
on
.
"
and
with
that
he
drew
me
along
toward
what
was
clearly
a
tavern
door
,
outside
which
men
were
sitting
on
a
couple
of
benches
and
drinking
meditatively
from
curiously
shaped
earthen
pots
glazed
green
and
yellow
,
some
with
quaint
devices
on
them
.
i
entered
the
door
and
started
at
first
with
my
old
astonishment
,
with
which
i
had
woke
up
,
so
strange
and
beautiful
did
this
interior
seem
to
me
,
though
it
was
but
a
pothouse
parlour
.
a
quaintly
-
carved
side
board
held
an
array
of
bright
pewter
pots
and
dishes
and
wooden
and
earthen
bowls
;
a
stout
oak
table
went
up
and
down
the
room
,
and
a
carved
oak
chair
stood
by
the
chimney
-
corner
,
now
filled
by
a
very
old
man
dim
-
eyed
and
white
-
bearded
.
that
,
except
the
rough
stools
and
benches
on
which
the
company
sat
,
was
all
the
furniture
.
the
walls
were
panelled
roughly
enough
with
oak
boards
to
about
six
feet
from
the
floor
,
and
about
three
feet
of
plaster
above
that
was
wrought
in
a
pattern
of
a
rose
stem
running
all
round
the
room
,
freely
and
roughly
done
,
but
with
(
as
it
seemed
to
my
unused
eyes
)
wonderful
skill
and
spirit
.
on
the
hood
of
the
great
chimney
a
huge
rose
was
wrought
in
the
plaster
and
brightly
painted
in
its
proper
colours
.
there
were
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
men
i
had
seen
coming
along
the
street
sitting
there
,
some
eating
and
all
drinking
;
their
cased
bows
leaned
against
the
wall
,
their
quivers
hung
on
pegs
in
the
panelling
,
and
in
a
corner
of
the
room
i
saw
half
-
a
-
dozen
bill
-
hooks
that
looked
made
more
for
war
than
for
hedge
-
shearing
,
with
ashen
handles
some
seven
foot
long
.
three
or
four
children
were
running
about
among
the
legs
of
the
men
,
heeding
them
mighty
little
in
their
bold
play
,
and
the
men
seemed
little
troubled
by
it
,
although
they
were
talking
earnestly
and
seriously
too
.
a
well
-
made
comely
girl
leaned
up
against
the
chimney
close
to
the
gaffer
'
s
chair
,
and
seemed
to
be
in
waiting
on
the
company
:
she
was
clad
in
a
close
-
fitting
gown
of
bright
blue
cloth
,
with
a
broad
silver
girdle
daintily
wrought
,
round
her
loins
,
a
rose
wreath
was
on
her
head
and
her
hair
hung
down
unbound
;
the
gaffer
grumbled
a
few
words
to
her
from
time
to
time
,
so
that
i
judged
he
was
her
grandfather
.
the
men
all
looked
up
as
we
came
into
the
room
,
my
mate
leading
me
by
the
hand
,
and
he
called
out
in
his
rough
,
good
-
tempered
voice
,
"
here
,
my
masters
,
i
bring
you
tidings
and
a
tale
;
give
it
meat
and
drink
that
it
may
be
strong
and
sweet
.
"
"
whence
are
thy
tidings
,
will
green
?
"
said
one
.
my
mate
grinned
again
with
the
pleasure
of
making
his
joke
once
more
in
a
bigger
company
:
"
it
seemeth
from
heaven
,
since
this
good
old
lad
hath
no
master
,
"
said
he
.
"
the
more
fool
he
to
come
here
,
"
said
a
thin
man
with
a
grizzled
beard
,
amidst
the
laughter
that
followed
,
"
unless
he
had
the
choice
given
him
between
hell
and
england
.
"
"
nay
,
"
said
i
,
"
i
come
not
from
heaven
,
but
from
essex
.
"
as
i
said
the
word
a
great
shout
sprang
from
all
mouths
at
once
,
as
clear
and
sudden
as
a
shot
from
a
gun
.
for
i
must
tell
you
that
i
knew
somehow
,
but
i
know
not
how
,
that
the
men
of
essex
were
gathering
to
rise
against
the
poll
-
groat
bailiffs
and
the
lords
that
would
turn
them
all
into
villeins
again
,
as
their
grandfathers
had
been
.
and
the
people
was
weak
and
the
lords
were
poor
;
for
many
a
mother
'
s
son
had
fallen
in
the
war
in
france
in
the
old
king
'
s
time
,
and
the
black
death
had
slain
a
many
;
so
that
the
lords
had
bethought
them
:
"
we
are
growing
poorer
,
and
these
upland
-
bred
villeins
are
growing
richer
,
and
the
guilds
of
craft
are
waxing
in
the
towns
,
and
soon
what
will
there
be
left
for
us
who
cannot
weave
and
will
not
dig
?
good
it
were
if
we
fell
on
all
who
are
not
guildsmen
or
men
of
free
land
,
if
we
fell
on
soccage
tenants
and
others
,
and
brought
both
the
law
and
the
strong
hand
on
them
,
and
made
them
all
villeins
in
deed
as
they
are
now
in
name
;
for
now
these
rascals
make
more
than
their
bellies
need
of
bread
,
and
their
backs
of
homespun
,
and
the
overplus
they
keep
to
themselves
;
and
we
are
more
worthy
of
it
than
they
.
so
let
us
get
the
collar
on
their
necks
again
,
and
make
their
day
'
s
work
longer
and
their
bever
-
time
shorter
,
as
the
good
statute
of
the
old
king
bade
.
and
good
it
were
if
the
holy
church
were
to
look
to
it
(
and
the
lollards
might
help
herein
)
that
all
these
naughty
and
wearisome
holidays
were
done
away
with
;
or
that
it
should
be
unlawful
for
any
man
below
the
degree
of
a
squire
to
keep
the
holy
days
of
the
church
,
except
in
the
heart
and
the
spirit
only
,
and
let
the
body
labour
meanwhile
;
for
does
not
the
apostle
say
,
`
if
a
man
work
not
,
neither
should
he
eat
'
?
and
if
such
things
were
done
,
and
such
an
estate
of
noble
rich
men
and
worthy
poor
men
upholden
for
ever
,
then
would
it
be
good
times
in
england
,
and
life
were
worth
the
living
.
"
all
this
were
the
lords
at
work
on
,
and
such
talk
i
knew
was
common
not
only
among
the
lords
themselves
,
but
also
among
their
sergeants
and
very
serving
-
men
.
but
the
people
would
not
abide
it
;
therefore
,
as
i
said
,
in
essex
they
were
on
the
point
of
rising
,
and
word
had
gone
how
that
at
st
.
albans
they
were
wellnigh
at
blows
with
the
lord
abbot
'
s
soldiers
;
that
north
away
at
norwich
john
litster
was
wiping
the
woad
from
his
arms
,
as
who
would
have
to
stain
them
red
again
,
but
not
with
grain
or
madder
;
and
that
the
valiant
tiler
of
dartford
had
smitten
a
poll
-
groat
bailiff
to
death
with
his
lath
-
rending
axe
for
mishandling
a
young
maid
,
his
daughter
;
and
that
the
men
of
kent
were
on
the
move
.
now
,
knowing
all
this
i
was
not
astonished
that
they
shouted
at
the
thought
of
their
fellows
the
men
of
essex
,
but
rather
that
they
said
little
more
about
it
;
only
will
green
saying
quietly
,
"
well
,
the
tidings
shall
be
told
when
our
fellowship
is
greater
;
fall
-
to
now
on
the
meat
,
brother
,
that
we
may
the
sooner
have
thy
tale
.
"
as
he
spoke
the
blue
-
clad
damsel
bestirred
herself
and
brought
me
a
clean
trencher
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
is
,
a
square
piece
of
thin
oak
board
scraped
clean
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
a
pewter
pot
of
liquor
.
so
without
more
ado
,
and
as
one
used
to
it
,
i
drew
my
knife
out
of
my
girdle
and
cut
myself
what
i
would
of
the
flesh
and
bread
on
the
table
.
but
will
green
mocked
at
me
as
i
cut
,
and
said
,
"
certes
,
brother
,
thou
hast
not
been
a
lord
'
s
carver
,
though
but
for
thy
word
thou
mightest
have
been
his
reader
.
hast
thou
seen
oxford
,
scholar
?
"
a
vision
of
grey
-
roofed
houses
and
a
long
winding
street
and
the
sound
of
many
bells
came
over
me
at
that
word
as
i
nodded
"
yes
"
to
him
,
my
mouth
full
of
salt
pork
and
rye
-
bread
;
and
then
i
lifted
my
pot
and
we
made
the
clattering
mugs
kiss
and
i
drank
,
and
the
fire
of
the
good
kentish
mead
ran
through
my
veins
and
deepened
my
dream
of
things
past
,
present
,
and
to
come
,
as
i
said
:
"
now
hearken
a
tale
,
since
ye
will
have
it
so
.
for
last
autumn
i
was
in
suffolk
at
the
good
town
of
dunwich
,
and
thither
came
the
keels
from
iceland
,
and
on
them
were
some
men
of
iceland
,
and
many
a
tale
they
had
on
their
tongues
;
and
with
these
men
i
foregathered
,
for
i
am
in
sooth
a
gatherer
of
tales
,
and
this
that
is
now
at
my
tongue
'
s
end
is
one
of
them
.
"
so
such
a
tale
i
told
them
,
long
familiar
to
me
;
but
as
i
told
it
the
words
seemed
to
quicken
and
grow
,
so
that
i
knew
not
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
,
and
they
ran
almost
into
rhyme
and
measure
as
i
told
it
;
and
when
i
had
done
there
was
silence
awhile
,
till
one
man
spake
,
but
not
loudly
:
"
yea
,
in
that
land
was
the
summer
short
and
the
winter
long
;
but
men
lived
both
summer
and
winter
;
and
if
the
trees
grew
ill
and
the
corn
throve
not
,
yet
did
the
plant
called
man
thrive
and
do
well
.
god
send
us
such
men
even
here
.
"
"
nay
,
"
said
another
,
"
such
men
have
been
and
will
be
,
and
belike
are
not
far
from
this
same
door
even
now
.
"
"
yea
,
"
said
a
third
,
"
hearken
a
stave
of
robin
hood
;
maybe
that
shall
hasten
the
coming
of
one
i
wot
of
.
"
and
he
fell
to
singing
in
a
clear
voice
,
for
he
was
a
young
man
,
and
to
a
sweet
wild
melody
,
one
of
those
ballads
which
in
an
incomplete
and
degraded
form
you
have
read
perhaps
.
my
heart
rose
high
as
i
heard
him
,
for
it
was
concerning
the
struggle
against
tyranny
for
the
freedom
of
life
,
how
that
the
wildwood
and
the
heath
,
despite
of
wind
and
weather
,
were
better
for
a
free
man
than
the
court
and
the
cheaping
-
town
;
of
the
taking
from
the
rich
to
give
to
the
poor
;
of
the
life
of
a
man
doing
his
own
will
and
not
the
will
of
another
man
commanding
him
for
the
commandment
'
s
sake
.
the
men
all
listened
eagerly
,
and
at
whiles
took
up
as
a
refrain
a
couplet
at
the
end
of
a
stanza
with
their
strong
and
rough
,
but
not
unmusical
voices
.
as
they
sang
,
a
picture
of
the
wild
-
woods
passed
by
me
,
as
they
were
indeed
,
no
park
-
like
dainty
glades
and
lawns
,
but
rough
and
tangled
thicket
and
bare
waste
and
heath
,
solemn
under
the
morning
sun
,
and
dreary
with
the
rising
of
the
evening
wind
and
the
drift
of
the
night
-
long
rain
.
when
he
had
done
,
another
began
in
something
of
the
same
strain
,
but
singing
more
of
a
song
than
a
story
ballad
;
and
thus
much
i
remember
of
it
:
the
sheriff
is
made
a
mighty
lord
,
of
goodly
gold
he
hath
enow
,
and
many
a
sergeant
girt
with
sword
;
but
forth
will
we
and
bend
the
bow
.
we
shall
bend
the
bow
on
the
lily
lea
betwixt
the
thorn
and
the
oaken
tree
.
with
stone
and
lime
is
the
burg
wall
built
,
and
pit
and
prison
are
stark
and
strong
,
and
many
a
true
man
there
is
spilt
,
and
many
a
right
man
doomed
by
wrong
.
so
forth
shall
we
and
bend
the
bow
and
the
king
'
s
writ
never
the
road
shall
know
.
now
yeomen
walk
ye
warily
,
and
heed
ye
the
houses
where
ye
go
,
for
as
fair
and
as
fine
as
they
may
be
,
lest
behind
your
heels
the
door
clap
to
.
fare
forth
with
the
bow
to
the
lily
lea
betwixt
the
thorn
and
the
oaken
tree
.
now
bills
and
bows
i
and
out
a
-
gate
!
and
turn
about
on
the
lily
lea
!
and
though
their
company
be
great
the
grey
-
goose
wing
shall
set
us
free
.
now
bent
is
the
bow
in
the
green
abode
and
the
king
'
s
writ
knoweth
not
the
road
.
so
over
the
mead
and
over
the
hithe
,
and
away
to
the
wild
-
wood
wend
we
forth
;
there
dwell
we
yeomen
bold
and
blithe
where
the
sheriff
'
s
word
is
nought
of
worth
.
bent
is
the
bow
on
the
lily
lea
betwixt
the
thorn
and
the
oaken
tree
.
but
here
the
song
dropped
suddenly
,
and
one
of
the
men
held
up
his
hand
as
who
would
say
,
hist
!
then
through
the
open
window
came
the
sound
of
another
song
,
gradually
swelling
as
though
sung
by
men
on
the
march
.
this
time
the
melody
was
a
piece
of
the
plain
-
song
of
the
church
,
familiar
enough
to
me
to
bring
back
to
my
mind
the
great
arches
of
some
cathedral
in
france
and
the
canons
singing
in
the
choir
.
all
leapt
up
and
hurried
to
take
their
bows
from
wall
and
corner
;
and
some
had
bucklers
withal
,
circles
of
leather
,
boiled
and
then
moulded
into
shape
and
hardened
:
these
were
some
two
hand
-
breadths
across
,
with
iron
or
brass
bosses
in
the
centre
.
will
green
went
to
the
corner
where
the
bills
leaned
against
the
wall
and
handed
them
round
to
the
first
-
comers
as
far
as
they
would
go
,
and
out
we
all
went
gravely
and
quietly
into
the
village
street
and
the
fair
sunlight
of
the
calm
afternoon
,
now
beginning
to
turn
towards
evening
.
none
had
said
anything
since
we
first
heard
the
new
-
come
singing
,
save
that
as
we
went
out
of
the
door
the
ballad
-
singer
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
and
said
:
"
was
it
not
sooth
that
i
said
,
brother
,
that
robin
hood
should
bring
us
john
ball
?
"
the
street
was
pretty
full
of
men
by
then
we
were
out
in
it
,
and
all
faces
turned
toward
the
cross
.
the
song
still
grew
nearer
and
louder
,
and
even
as
we
looked
we
saw
it
turning
the
corner
through
the
hedges
of
the
orchards
and
closes
,
a
good
clump
of
men
,
more
armed
,
as
it
would
seem
,
than
our
villagers
,
as
the
low
sun
flashed
back
from
many
points
of
bright
iron
and
steel
.
the
words
of
the
song
could
now
be
heard
,
and
amidst
them
i
could
pick
out
will
green
'
s
late
challenge
to
me
and
my
answer
;
but
as
i
was
bending
all
my
mind
to
disentangle
more
words
from
the
music
,
suddenly
from
the
new
white
tower
behind
us
clashed
out
the
church
bells
,
harsh
and
hurried
at
first
,
but
presently
falling
into
measured
chime
;
and
at
the
first
sound
of
them
a
great
shout
went
up
from
us
and
was
echoed
by
the
new
-
comers
,
"
john
ball
hath
rung
our
bell
!
"
then
we
pressed
on
,
and
presently
we
were
all
mingled
together
at
the
cross
.
will
green
had
good
-
naturedly
thrust
and
pulled
me
forward
,
so
that
i
found
myself
standing
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
cross
,
his
seventy
-
two
inches
of
man
on
one
side
of
me
.
he
chuckled
while
i
panted
,
and
said
:
"
there
'
s
for
thee
a
good
hearing
and
seeing
stead
,
old
lad
.
thou
art
tall
across
thy
belly
and
not
otherwise
,
and
thy
wind
,
belike
,
is
none
of
the
best
,
and
but
for
me
thou
wouldst
have
been
amidst
the
thickest
of
the
throng
,
and
have
heard
words
muffled
by
kentish
bellies
and
seen
little
but
swinky
woollen
elbows
and
greasy
plates
and
jacks
.
look
no
more
on
the
ground
,
as
though
thou
sawest
a
hare
,
but
let
thine
eyes
and
thine
ears
be
busy
to
gather
tidings
to
bear
back
to
essex
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
or
heaven
!
"
i
grinned
good
-
fellowship
at
him
but
said
nothing
,
for
in
truth
my
eyes
and
ears
were
as
busy
as
he
would
have
them
to
be
.
a
buzz
of
general
talk
went
up
from
the
throng
amidst
the
regular
cadence
of
the
bells
,
which
now
seemed
far
away
and
as
it
were
that
they
were
not
swayed
by
hands
,
but
were
living
creatures
making
that
noise
of
their
own
wills
.
i
looked
around
and
saw
that
the
newcomers
mingled
with
us
must
have
been
a
regular
armed
band
;
all
had
bucklers
slung
at
their
backs
,
few
lacked
a
sword
at
the
side
.
some
had
bows
,
some
"
staves
"
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
that
is
,
bills
,
pole
-
axes
,
or
pikes
.
moreover
,
unlike
our
villagers
,
they
had
defensive
arms
.
most
had
steel
-
caps
on
their
heads
,
and
some
had
body
armour
,
generally
a
"
jack
,
"
or
coat
into
which
pieces
of
iron
or
horn
were
quilted
;
some
had
also
steel
or
steel
-
and
-
leather
arm
or
thigh
pieces
.
there
were
a
few
mounted
men
among
them
,
their
horses
being
big
-
boned
hammer
-
headed
beasts
,
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
taken
from
plough
or
waggon
,
but
their
riders
were
well
armed
with
steel
armour
on
their
heads
,
legs
,
and
arms
.
amongst
the
horsemen
i
noted
the
man
that
had
ridden
past
me
when
i
first
awoke
;
but
he
seemed
to
be
a
prisoner
,
as
he
had
a
woollen
hood
on
his
head
instead
of
his
helmet
,
and
carried
neither
bill
,
sword
,
nor
dagger
.
he
seemed
by
no
means
ill
-
at
-
ease
,
however
,
but
was
laughing
and
talking
with
the
men
who
stood
near
him
.
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
,
and
now
slowly
working
towards
the
cross
,
was
a
banner
on
a
high
-
raised
cross
-
pole
,
a
picture
of
a
man
and
woman
half
-
clad
in
skins
of
beasts
seen
against
a
background
of
green
trees
,
the
man
holding
a
spade
and
the
woman
a
distaff
and
spindle
rudely
done
enough
,
but
yet
with
a
certain
spirit
and
much
meaning
;
and
underneath
this
symbol
of
the
early
world
and
man
'
s
first
contest
with
nature
were
the
written
words
:
when
adam
delved
and
eve
span
who
was
then
the
gentleman
?
the
banner
came
on
and
through
the
crowd
,
which
at
last
opened
where
we
stood
for
its
passage
,
and
the
banner
-
bearer
turned
and
faced
the
throng
and
stood
on
the
first
step
of
the
cross
beside
me
.
a
man
followed
him
,
clad
in
a
long
dark
-
brown
gown
of
coarse
woollen
,
girt
with
a
cord
,
to
which
hung
a
"
pair
of
beads
"
(
or
rosary
,
as
we
should
call
it
to
-
day
)
and
a
book
in
a
bag
.
the
man
was
tall
and
big
-
boned
,
a
ring
of
dark
hair
surrounded
his
priest
'
s
tonsure
;
his
nose
was
big
but
clear
cut
and
with
wide
nostrils
;
his
shaven
face
showed
a
longish
upper
lip
and
a
big
but
blunt
chin
;
his
mouth
was
big
and
the
lips
closed
firmly
;
a
face
not
very
noteworthy
but
for
his
grey
eyes
well
opened
and
wide
apart
,
at
whiles
lighting
up
his
whole
face
with
a
kindly
smile
,
at
whiles
set
and
stern
,
at
whiles
resting
in
that
look
as
if
they
were
gazing
at
something
a
long
way
off
,
which
is
the
wont
of
the
eyes
of
the
poet
or
enthusiast
.
he
went
slowly
up
the
steps
of
the
cross
and
stood
at
the
top
with
one
hand
laid
on
the
shaft
,
and
shout
upon
shout
broke
forth
from
the
throng
.
when
the
shouting
died
away
into
a
silence
of
the
human
voices
,
the
bells
were
still
quietly
chiming
with
that
far
-
away
voice
of
theirs
,
and
the
long
-
winged
dusky
swifts
,
by
no
means
scared
by
the
concourse
,
swung
round
about
the
cross
with
their
wild
squeals
;
and
the
man
stood
still
for
a
little
,
eyeing
the
throng
,
or
rather
looking
first
at
one
and
then
another
man
in
it
,
as
though
he
were
trying
to
think
what
such
an
one
was
thinking
of
,
or
what
he
were
fit
for
.
sometimes
he
caught
the
eye
of
one
or
other
,
and
then
that
kindly
smile
spread
over
his
face
,
but
faded
off
it
into
the
sternness
and
sadness
of
a
man
who
has
heavy
and
great
thoughts
hanging
about
him
.
but
when
john
ball
first
mounted
the
steps
of
the
cross
a
lad
at
some
one
'
s
bidding
had
run
off
to
stop
the
ringers
,
and
so
presently
the
voice
of
the
bells
fell
dead
,
leaving
on
men
'
s
minds
that
sense
of
blankness
or
even
disappointment
which
is
always
caused
by
the
sudden
stopping
of
a
sound
one
has
got
used
to
and
found
pleasant
.
but
a
great
expectation
had
fallen
by
now
on
all
that
throng
,
and
no
word
was
spoken
even
in
a
whisper
,
and
all
men
'
s
hearts
and
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
dark
figure
standing
straight
up
now
by
the
tall
white
shaft
of
the
cross
,
his
hands
stretched
out
before
him
,
one
palm
laid
upon
the
other
.
and
for
me
,
as
i
made
ready
to
hearken
,
i
felt
a
joy
in
my
soul
that
i
had
never
yet
felt
.
so
now
i
heard
john
ball
;
how
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
said
:
"
ho
,
all
ye
good
people
!
i
am
a
priest
of
god
,
and
in
my
day
'
s
work
it
cometh
that
i
should
tell
you
what
ye
should
do
,
and
what
ye
should
forbear
doing
,
and
to
that
end
i
am
come
hither
:
yet
first
,
if
i
myself
have
wronged
any
man
here
,
let
him
say
wherein
my
wrongdoing
lieth
,
that
i
may
ask
his
pardon
and
his
pity
.
"
a
great
hum
of
good
-
will
ran
through
the
crowd
as
he
spoke
;
then
he
smiled
as
in
a
kind
of
pride
,
and
again
he
spoke
:
"
wherefore
did
ye
take
me
out
of
the
archbishop
'
s
prison
but
three
days
agone
,
when
ye
lighted
the
archbishop
'
s
house
for
the
candle
of
canterbury
,
but
that
i
might
speak
to
you
and
pray
you
:
therefore
i
will
not
keep
silence
,
whether
i
have
done
ill
,
or
whether
i
have
done
well
.

herein
,
good
fellows

my
very
brethren

i
would
have
you
to

me

such
here

i

full
well

some

my
poor
brethren
who
have
gone
astray
,
i
say
not
to
you
,
go
home
and
repent
lest
you
mar
our
great
deeds
,

rather
come
afield
and
there
repent
.
many
a
day
have
ye
been
fools
,
but
hearken
unto
me
and
i
shall
make
you
wise
above
the
wisdom
of
the
earth
;
and
if
ye
die
in
your
wisdom
,
as
god
wot
ye
well
may
,
since
the
fields
ye
wend
to
bear
swords
for
daisies
,
and
spears
for
bents
,
then
shall
ye
be
,
though
men
call
you
dead
,
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
living
wisdom
of
all
things

stones
of
the
pillars

ye
have
heard

in
the

come
ye
may
live
happily
for
ever

do
ye
well
then
,
and
have
your
reward
both
on
earth
and
in
heaven
;
for
i
say
to
you
that
earth
and
heaven
are
not
two
but
one
;
and
this
one
is
that
which
ye
know
,
and
are
each
one
of
you
a
part
of
,
to
wit
,
the
holy
church
,
and
in
each
one
of
you
dwelleth
the
life
of
the
church
,
unless
ye
slay
it
.
forsooth
,
brethren
,
will
ye
murder
the
church
any
one
of
you
,
and
go
forth
a
wandering
man
and
lonely
,
even
as
cain
did
who
slew
his
brother
?
ah
,
my
brothers
,
what
an
evil
doom
is
this
,
to
be
an
outcast
from
the
church
,
to
have
none
to
love
you
and
to
speak
with
you
,
to
be
without
fellowship
!
forsooth
,
brothers
,
fellowship
is
heaven
,
and
lack
of
fellowship
is
hell
:
fellowship
is
life
,
and
lack
of
fellowship
is
death
:
and
the
deeds
that
ye
do
upon
the
earth
,
it
is
for
fellowship
'
s
sake
that
ye
do
them
,
and
the
life
that
is
in
it
,
that
shall
live
on
and
on
for
ever
,
and
each
one
of
you
part
of
it
,
while
many
a
man
'
s
life
upon
the
earth
from
the
earth
shall
wane
.
"
therefore
,
i
bid
you
not
dwell
in
hell
but
in
heaven
,
or
while
ye
must
,
upon
earth
,
which
is
a
part
of
heaven
,
and
forsooth
no
foul
part
.
"
forsooth
,
he
that
waketh
in
hell
and
feeleth
his
heart
fail
him
,
shall
have
memory
of
the
merry
days
of
earth
,
and
how
that
when
his
heart
failed
him
there
,
he
cried
on
his
fellow
,
were
it
his
wife
or
his
son
or
his
brother
or
his
gossip
or
his
brother
sworn
in
arms
,
and
how
that
his
fellow
heard
him
and
came
and
they
mourned
together
under
the
sun
,
till
again
they
laughed
together
and
were
but
half
sorry
between
them
.
this
shall
he
think
on
in
hell
,
and
cry
on
his
fellow
to
help
him
,
and
shall
find
that
therein
is
no
help
because
there
is
no
fellowship
,
but
every
man
for
himself
.
therefore
,
i
tell
you
that
the
proud
,
despiteous
rich
man
,
though
he
knoweth
it
not
,
is
in
hell
already
,
because
he
hath
no
fellow
;
and
he
that
hath
so
hardy
a
heart
that
in
sorrow
he
thinketh
of
fellowship
,
his
sorrow
is
soon
but
a
story
of
sorrow
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
little
change
in
the
life
that
knows
not
ill
.
"
he
left
off
for
a
little
;
and
indeed
for
some
time
his
voice
had
fallen
,
but
it
was
so
clear
and
the
summer
evening
so
soft
and
still
,
and
the
silence
of
the
folk
so
complete
,
that
every
word
told
.
his
eyes
fell
down
to
the
crowd
as
he
stopped
speaking
,
since
for
some
little
while
they
had
been
looking
far
away
into
the
blue
distance
of
summer
;
and
the
kind
eyes
of
the
man
had
a
curious
sight
before
him
in
that
crowd
,
for
amongst
them
were
many
who
by
this
time
were
not
dry
-
eyed
,
and
some
wept
outright
in
spite
of
their
black
beards
,
while
all
had
that
look
as
if
they
were
ashamed
of
themselves
,
and
did
not
want
others
to
see
how
deeply
they
were
moved
,
after
the
fashion
of
their
race
when
they
are
strongly
stirred
.
i
looked
at
will
green
beside
me
:
his
right
hand
clutched
his
bow
so
tight
,
that
the
knuckles
whitened
;
he
was
staring
straight
before
him
,
and
the
tears
were
running
out
of
his
eyes
and
down
his
big
nose
as
though
without
his
will
,
for
his
face
was
stolid
and
unmoved
all
the
time
till
he
caught
my
eye
,
and
then
he
screwed
up
the
strangest
face
,
of
scowling
brow
,
weeping
eyes
,
and
smiling
mouth
,
while
he
dealt
me
a
sounding
thump
in
the
ribs
with
his
left
elbow
,
which
,
though
it
would
have
knocked
me
down
but
for
the
crowd
,
i
took
as
an
esquire
does
the
accolade
which
makes
a
knight
of
him
.
but
while
i
pondered
all
these
things
,
and
how
men
fight
and
lose
the
battle
,
and
the
thing
that
they
fought
for
comes
about
in
spite
of
their
defeat
,
and
when
it
comes
turns
out
not
to
be
what
they
meant
,
and
other
men
have
to
fight
for
what
they
meant
under
another
name
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
while
i
pondered
all
this
,
john
ball
began
to
speak
again
in
the
same
soft
and
dear
voice
with
which
he
had
left
off
.
"
good
fellows
,
it
was
your
fellowship
and
your
kindness
that
took
me
out
of
the
archbishop
'
s
prison
three
days
agone
,
though
god
wot
ye
had
nought
to
gain
by
it
save
outlawry
and
the
gallows
;
yet
lacked
i
not
your
fellowship
before
ye
drew
near
me
in
the
body
,
and
when
between
me
and
canterbury
street
was
yet
a
strong
wall
,
and
the
turnkeys
and
sergeants
and
bailiffs
.
"
for
hearken
,
my
friends
and
helpers
;
many
days
ago
,
when
april
was
yet
young
,
i
lay
there
,
and
the
heart
that
i
had
strung
up
to
bear
all
things
because
of
the
fellowship
of
men
and
the
blessed
saints
and
the
angels
and
those
that
are
,
and
those
that
are
to
be
,
this
heart
,
that
i
had
strung
up
like
a
strong
bow
,
fell
into
feebleness
,
so
that
i
lay
there
a
-
longing
for
the
green
fields
and
the
white
-
thorn
bushes
and
the
lark
singing
over
the
corn
,
and
the
talk
of
good
fellows
round
the
ale
-
house
bench
,
and
the
babble
of
the
little
children
,
and
the
team
on
the
road
and
the
beasts
afield
,
and
all
the
life
of
earth
;
and
i
alone
all
the
while
,
near
my
foes
and
afar
from
my
friends
,
mocked
and
flouted
and
starved
with
cold
and
hunger
;
and
so
weak
was
my
heart
that
though
i
longed
for
all
these
things
yet
i
saw
them
not
,
nor
knew
them
but
as
names
;
and
i
longed
so
sore
to
be
gone
that
i
chided
myself
that
i
had
once
done
well
;
and
i
said
to
myself
:
"
forsooth
,
hadst
thou
kept
thy
tongue
between
thy
teeth
thou
mightest
have
been
something
,
if
it
had
been
but
a
parson
of
a
town
,
and
comfortable
to
many
a
poor
man
;
and
then
mightest
thou
have
clad
here
and
there
the
naked
back
,
and
filled
the
empty
belly
,
and
holpen
many
,
and
men
would
have
spoken
well
of
thee
,
and
of
thyself
thou
hadst
thought
well
;
and
all
this
hast
thou
lost
for
lack
of
a
word
here
and
there
to
some
great
man
,
and
a
little
winking
of
the
eyes
amidst
murder
and
wrong
and
unruth
;
and
now
thou
art
nought
and
helpless
,
and
the
hemp
for
thee
is
sown
and
grown
and
heckled
and
spun
,
and
lo
there
,
the
rope
for
thy
gallows
-
tree
!
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
all
for
nought
,
for
nought
.
"
forsooth
,
my
friends
,
thus
i
thought
and
sorrowed
in
my
feebleness
that
i
had
not
been
a
traitor
to
the
fellowship
of
the
church
,
for
e
'
en
so
evil
was
my
foolish
imagination
.
"
yet
,
forsooth
,
as
i
fell
a
-
pondering
over
all
the
comfort
and
help
that
i
might
have
been
and
that
i
might
have
had
,
if
i
had
been
but
a
little
of
a
trembling
cur
to
creep
and
crawl
before
abbot
and
bishop
and
baron
and
bailiff
,
came
the
thought
over
me
of
the
evil
of
the
world
wherewith
i
,
john
ball
,
the
rascal
hedge
-
priest
,
had
fought
and
striven
in
the
fellowship
of
the
saints
in
heaven
and
poor
men
upon
earth
.
"
yea
,
forsooth
,
once
again
i
saw
as
of
old
,
the
great
treading
down
the
little
,
and
the
strong
beating
down
the
weak
,
and
cruel
men
fearing
not
,
and
kind
men
daring
not
,
and
wise
men
caring
not
;
and
the
saints
in
heaven
forbearing
and
yet
bidding
me
not
to
forbear
;
forsooth
,
i
knew
once
more
that
he
who
doeth
well
in
fellowship
,
and
because
of
fellowship
,
shall
not
fail
though
he
seem
to
fail
to
-
day
,
but
in
days
hereafter
shall
he
and
his
work
yet
be
alive
,
and
men
be
holpen
by
them
to
strive
again
and
yet
again
;
and
yet
indeed
even
that
was
little
,
since
,
forsooth
,
to
strive
was
my
pleasure
and
my
life
.
"
so
i
became
a
man
once
more
,
and
i
rose
up
to
my
feet
and
went
up
and
down
my
prison
what
i
could
for
my
hopples
,
and
into
my
mouth
came
words
of
good
cheer
,
even
such
as
we
to
-
day
have
sung
,
and
stoutly
i
sang
them
,
even
as
we
now
have
sung
them
;
and
then
did
i
rest
me
,
and
once
more
thought
of
those
pleasant
fields
where
i
would
be
,
and
all
the
life
of
man
and
beast
about
them
,
and
i
said
to
myself
that
i
should
see
them
once
more
before
i
died
,
if
but
once
it
were
.
"
forsooth
,
this
was
strange
,
that
whereas
before
i
longed
for
them
and
yet
saw
them
not
,
now
that
my
longing
was
slaked
my
vision
was
cleared
,
and
i
saw
them
as
though
the
prison
walls
opened
to
me
and
i
was
out
of
canterbury
street
and
amidst
the
green
meadows
of
april
;
and
therewithal
along
with
me
folk
that
i
have
known
and
who
are
dead
,
and
folk
that
are
living
;
yea
,
and
all
those
of
the
fellowship
on
earth
and
in
heaven
;
yea
,
and
all
that
are
here
this
day
.
overlong
were
the
tale
to
tell
of
them
,
and
of
the
time
that
is
gone
.
"
so
thenceforward
i
wore
through
the
days
with
no
such
faint
heart
,
until
one
day
the
prison
opened
verily
and
in
the
daylight
,
and
there
were
ye
,
my
fellows
,
in
the
door
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
your
faces
glad
,
your
hearts
light
with
hope
,
and
your
hands
heavy
with
wrath
;
then
i
saw
and
understood
what
was
to
do
.
now
,
therefore
,
do
ye
understand
it
!
"
his
voice
was
changed
,
and
grew
louder
than
loud
now
,
as
he
cast
his
hands
abroad
towards
that
company
with
those
last
words
of
his
;
and
i
could
feel
that
all
shame
and
fear
was
falling
from
those
men
,
and
that
mere
fiery
manhood
was
shining
through
their
wonted
english
shamefast
stubbornness
,
and
that
they
were
moved
indeed
and
saw
the
road
before
them
.
yet
no
man
spoke
,
rather
the
silence
of
the
men
-
folk
deepened
,
as
the
sun
'
s
rays
grew
more
level
and
more
golden
,
and
the
swifts
wheeled
about
shriller
and
louder
than
before
.
then
again
john
ball
spoke
and
said
,
"
in
good
sooth
,
i
deem
ye
wot
no
worse
than
i
do
what
is
to
do
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and
first
that
somewhat
we
shall
do
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
since
it
is
for
him
that
is
lonely
or
in
prison
to
dream
of
fellowship
,
but
for
him
that
is
of
a
fellowship
to
do
and
not
to
dream
.
"
and
next
,
ye
know
who
is
the
foeman
,
and
that
is
the
proud
man
,
the
oppressor
,
who
scorneth
fellowship
,
and
himself
is
a
world
to
himself
and
needeth
no
helper
nor
helpeth
any
,
but
,
heeding
no
law
,
layeth
law
on
other
men
because
he
is
rich
;
and
surely
every
one
that
is
rich
is
such
an
one
,
nor
may
be
other
.
"
forsooth
,
in
the
belly
of
every
rich
man
dwelleth
a
devil
of
hell
,
and
when
the
man
would
give
his
goods
to
the
poor
,
the
devil
within
him
gainsayeth
it
,
and
saith
,
`
wilt
thou
then
be
of
the
poor
,
and
suffer
cold
and
hunger
and
mocking
as
they
suffer
,
then
give
thou
thy
goods
to
them
,
and
keep
them
not
.
'
and
when
he
would
be
compassionate
,
again
saith
the
devil
to
him
,
`
if
thou
heed
these
losels
and
turn
on
them
a
face
like
to
their
faces
,
and
deem
of
them
as
men
,
then
shall
they
scorn
thee
,
and
evil
shall
come
of
it
,
and
even
one
day
they
shall
fall
on
thee
to
slay
thee
when
they
have
learned
that
thou
art
but
as
they
be
.
'
"
ah
,
woe
worth
the
while
!
too
oft
he
sayeth
sooth
,
as
the
wont
of
the
devil
is
,
that
lies
may
be
born
of
the
barren
truth
;
and
sooth
it
is
that
the
poor
deemeth
the
rich
to
be
other
than
he
,
and
meet
to
be
his
master
,
as
though
,
forsooth
,
the
poor
were
come
of
adam
,
and
the
rich
of
him
that
made
adam
,
that
is
god
;
and
thus
the
poor
man
oppresseth
the
poor
man
,
because
he
feareth
the
oppressor
.
nought
such
are
ye
,
my
brethren
;
or
else
why
are
ye
gathered
here
in
harness
to
bid
all
bear
witness
of
you
that
ye
are
the
sons
of
one
man
and
one
mother
,
begotten
of
the
earth
?
"
as
he
said
the
words
there
came
a
stir
among
the
weapons
of
the
throng
,
and
they
pressed
closer
round
the
cross
,
yet
with
held
the
shout
as
yet
which
seemed
gathering
in
their
bosoms
.
and
again
he
said
:
"
forsooth
,
too
many
rich
men
there
are
in
this
realm
;
and
yet
if
there
were
but
one
,
there
would
be
one
too
many
,
for
all
should
be
his
thralls

hearken
,
then
,
ye
men
of
kent
.
for
overlong
belike
have
i
held
you
with
words
;
but
the
love
of
you
constrained
me
,
and
the
joy
that
a
man
hath
to
babble
to
his
friends
and
his
fellows
whom
he
hath
not
seen
for
a
long
season
.
"
now
,
hearken
,
i
bid
you
:
to
the
rich
men
that
eat
up
a
realm
there
cometh
a
time
when
they
whom
they
eat
up
,
that
is
the
poor
,
seem
poorer
than
of
wont
,
and
their
complaint
goeth
up
louder
to
the
heavens
;
yet
it
is
no
riddle
to
say
that
oft
at
such
times
the
fellowship
of
the
poor
is
waxing
stronger
,
else
would
no
man
have
heard
his
cry
.
also
at
such
times
is
the
rich
man
become
fearful
,

so
waxeth
in
cruelty
,

of
that
cruelty
do
people
misdeem
that
it
is
power
and
might
waxing
.
forsooth
,
ye
are
stronger
than
your
fathers
,
because
ye
are
more
grieved
than
they

and
ye
should
have
been
less
grieved
than
they

ye
been
horses

swine
;

then
,
forsooth
,
would
ye
have
been
stronger
to
bear
;

ye

ye
are
not
strong
to

to
do
.

ye
why
we
are
come
to
you
this
fair
eve
of
holiday

wot
ye
why
i
have
been
telling
of
fellowship
to
you

yea
,
forsooth
,
i
deem
ye
wot
well
,
that
it
is
for
this
cause
,
that
ye
might
bethink
you
of
your
fellowship
with
the
men

"
his
last
word
let
loose
the
shout
that
had
been
long
on
all
men
'
s
lips
,
and
great
and
fierce
it
was
as
it
rang
shattering
through
the
quiet
upland
village
.
but
john
ball
held
up
his
hand
,
and
the
shout
was
one
and
no
more
.
then
he
spoke
again
:

wot
well

so
hard
bested

the
token
of
the
day
when
behind
the
screen
of
leafy
boughs
ye
met
duke
william
with
bill

bow
as
he
wended
londonward
from
that
woeful
field
of
senlac

i
have
told
of
fellowship

ye
have
hearkened

understood
what
the
holy
church

have
arisen
again

eager
voice
rising
higher

till
it
be
gone
,
and
he
be
no
more
a
churl
;
and
fellowship
shall
be
established
in
heaven
and
on
the
earth
.
"
he
left
off
as
one
who
had
yet
something
else
to
say
;
and
,
indeed
,
i
thought
he
would
give
us
some
word
as
to
the
trysting
-
place
,
and
whither
the
army
was
to
go
from
it
;
because
it
was
now
clear
to
me
that
this
gathering
was
but
a
band
of
an
army
.
but
much
happened
before
john
ball
spoke
again
from
the
cross
,
and
it
was
on
this
wise
.
when
there
was
silence
after
the
last
shout
that
the
crowd
had
raised
a
while
ago
,
i
thought
i
heard
a
thin
sharp
noise
far
away
,
somewhat
to
the
north
of
the
cross
,
which
i
took
rather
for
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
or
horn
,
than
for
the
voice
of
a
man
or
any
beast
.
will
green
also
seemed
to
have
heard
it
,
for
he
turned
his
head
sharply
and
then
back
again
,
and
looked
keenly
into
the
crowd
as
though
seeking
to
catch
some
one
'
s
eye
.
there
was
a
very
tall
man
standing
by
the
prisoner
on
the
horse
near
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
,
and
holding
his
bridle
.
this
man
,
who
was
well
-
armed
,
i
saw
look
up
and
say
something
to
the
prisoner
,
who
stooped
down
and
seemed
to
whisper
him
in
turn
.
the
tall
man
nodded
his
head
and
the
prisoner
got
off
his
horse
,
which
was
a
cleaner
-
limbed
,
better
-
built
beast
than
the
others
belonging
to
the
band
,
and
the
tall
man
quietly
led
him
a
little
way
from
the
crowd
,
mounted
him
,
and
rode
off
northward
at
a
smart
pace
.
will
green
looked
on
sharply
at
all
this
,
and
when
the
man
rode
off
,
smiled
as
one
who
is
content
,
and
deems
that
all
is
going
well
,
and
settled
himself
down
again
to
listen
to
the
priest
.
but
now
when
john
ball
had
ceased
speaking
,
and
after
another
shout
,
and
a
hum
of
excited
pleasure
and
hope
that
followed
it
,
there
was
silence
again
,
and
as
the
priest
addressed
himself
to
speaking
once
more
,
he
paused
and
turned
his
head
towards
the
wind
,
as
if
he
heard
something
,
which
certainly
i
heard
,
and
belike
every
one
in
the
throng
,
though
it
was
not
over
-
loud
,
far
as
sounds
carry
in
clear
quiet
evenings
.
it
was
the
thump
-
a
-
thump
of
a
horse
drawing
near
at
a
hand
-
gallop
along
the
grassy
upland
road
;
and
i
knew
well
it
was
the
tall
man
coming
back
with
tidings
,
the
purport
of
which
i
could
well
guess
.
i
looked
up
at
will
green
'
s
face
.
he
was
smiling
as
one
pleased
,
and
said
softly
as
he
nodded
to
me
,
"
yea
,
shall
we
see
the
grey
-
goose
fly
this
eve
?
"
but
john
ball
said
in
a
great
voice
from
the
cross
,
"
hear
ye
the
tidings
on
the
way
,
fellows
!
hold
ye
together
and
look
to
your
gear
;
yet
hurry
not
,
for
no
great
matter
shall
this
be
.
i
wot
well
there
is
little
force
between
canterbury
and
kingston
,
for
the
lords
are
looking
north
of
thames
toward
wat
tyler
and
his
men
.
yet
well
it
is
,
well
it
is
!
"
the
crowd
opened
and
spread
out
a
little
,
and
the
men
moved
about
in
it
,
some
tightening
a
girdle
,
some
getting
their
side
arms
more
within
reach
of
their
right
hands
,
and
those
who
had
bows
stringing
them
.
will
green
set
hand
and
foot
to
the
great
shapely
piece
of
polished
red
yew
,
with
its
shining
horn
tips
,
which
he
carried
,
and
bent
it
with
no
seeming
effort
;
then
he
reached
out
his
hand
over
his
shoulder
and
drew
out
a
long
arrow
,
smooth
,
white
,
beautifully
balanced
,
with
a
barbed
iron
head
at
one
end
,
a
horn
nock
and
three
strong
goose
feathers
at
the
other
.
he
held
it
loosely
between
the
finger
and
thumb
of
his
right
hand
,
and
there
he
stood
with
a
thoughtful
look
on
his
face
,
and
in
his
hands
one
of
the
most
terrible
weapons
which
a
strong
man
has
ever
carried
,
the
english
long
-
bow
and
cloth
-
yard
shaft
.
but
all
this
while
the
sound
of
the
horse
'
s
hoofs
was
growing
nearer
,
and
presently
from
the
corner
of
the
road
amidst
the
orchards
broke
out
our
long
friend
,
his
face
red
in
the
sun
near
sinking
now
.
he
waved
his
right
hand
as
he
came
in
sight
of
us
,
and
sang
out
,
"
bills
and
bows
!
bills
and
bows
!
"
and
the
whole
throng
turned
towards
him
and
raised
a
great
shout
.
he
reined
up
at
the
edge
of
the
throng
,
and
spoke
in
a
loud
voice
,
so
that
all
might
hear
him
:
"
fellows
,
these
are
the
tidings
;
even
while
our
priest
was
speaking
we
heard
a
horn
blow
far
off
;
so
i
bade
the
sergeant
we
have
taken
,
and
who
is
now
our
fellow
-
in
-
arms
,
to
tell
me
where
away
it
was
that
there
would
be
folk
a
-
gathering
,
and
what
they
were
;
and
he
did
me
to
wit
that
mayhappen
sir
john
newton
was
stirring
from
rochester
castle
;
or
,
maybe
,
it
was
the
sheriff
and
rafe
hopton
with
him
;
so
i
rode
off
what
i
might
towards
hartlip
,
and
i
rode
warily
,
and
that
was
well
,
for
as
i
came
through
a
little
wood
between
hartlip
and
guildstead
,
i
saw
beyond
it
a
gleam
of
steel
,
and
lo
in
the
field
there
a
company
,
and
a
pennon
of
rafe
hopton
'
s
arms
,
and
that
is
blue
and
thereon
three
silver
fish
:
and
a
pennon
of
the
sheriff
'
s
arms
,
and
that
is
a
green
tree
;
and
withal
another
pennon
of
three
red
kine
,
and
whose
they
be
i
know
not
.
"
there
tied
i
my
horse
in
the
middle
of
the
wood
,
and
myself
i
crept
along
the
dyke
to
see
more
and
to
hear
somewhat
;
and
no
talk
i
heard
to
tell
of
save
at
whiles
a
big
knight
talking
to
five
or
six
others
,
and
saying
somewhat
,
wherein
came
the
words
london
and
nicholas
bramber
,
and
king
richard
;
but
i
saw
that
of
men
-
at
-
arms
and
sergeants
there
might
be
a
hundred
,
and
of
bows
not
many
,
but
of
those
outland
arbalests
maybe
a
fifty
;
and
so
,
what
with
one
and
another
of
servants
and
tipstaves
and
lads
,
some
three
hundred
,
well
armed
,
and
the
men
-
at
-
arms
of
the
best
.
forsooth
,
my
masters
,
there
had
i
been
but
a
minute
,
ere
the
big
knight
broke
off
his
talk
,
and
cried
out
to
the
music
to
blow
up
,
`
and
let
us
go
look
on
these
villeins
,
'
said
he
;
and
withal
the
men
began
to
gather
in
a
due
and
ordered
company
,
and
their
faces
turned
hitherward
;
forsooth
,
i
got
to
my
horse
,
and
led
him
out
of
the
wood
on
the
other
side
,
and
so
to
saddle
and
away
along
the
green
roads
;
neither
was
i
seen
or
chased
.
so
look
ye
to
it
,
my
masters
,
for
these
men
will
be
coming
to
speak
with
us
;
nor
is
there
need
for
haste
,
but
rather
for
good
speed
;
for
in
some
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
will
be
more
tidings
to
hand
.
"
by
this
time
one
of
our
best
-
armed
men
had
got
through
the
throng
and
was
standing
on
the
cross
beside
john
ball
.
when
the
long
man
had
done
,
there
was
confused
noise
of
