i
got
into
my
old
place
again
on
the
steps
of
the
cross
,
will
green
beside
me
,
and
above
me
john
ball
and
jack
straw
again
.
the
moon
was
half
-
way
up
the
heavens
now
,
and
the
short
summer
night
had
begun
,
calm
and
fragrant
,
with
just
so
much
noise
outside
our
quiet
circle
as
made
one
feel
the
world
alive
and
happy
.
we
waited
silently
until
we
had
heard
john
ball
and
the
story
of
what
was
to
do
;
and
presently
he
began
to
speak
.
"
good
people
,
it
is
begun
,
but
not
ended
.
which
of
you
is
hardy
enough
to
wend
the
road
to
london
to
-
morrow
?
"
"
all
!
all
!
"
they
shouted
.
"
yea
,
"
said
he
,
"
even
so
i
deemed
of
you
.
yet
forsooth
hearken
!
london
is
a
great
and
grievous
city
;
and
mayhappen
when
ye
come
thither
it
shall
seem
to
you
overgreat
to
deal
with
,
when
ye
remember
the
little
townships
and
the
cots
ye
came
from
.
"
moreover
,
when
ye
dwell
here
in
kent
ye
think
forsooth
of
your
brethren
in
essex
or
suffolk
,
and
there
belike
an
end
.
but
from
london
ye
may
have
an
inkling
of
all
the
world
,
and
over
-
burdensome
maybe
shall
that
seem
to
you
,
a
few
and
a
feeble
people
.
"
nevertheless
i
say
to
you
,
remember
the
fellowship
,
in
the
hope
of
which
ye
have
this
day
conquered
;
and
when
ye
come
to
london
be
wise
and
wary
;
and
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
,
be
bold
and
hardy
;
for
in
these
days
are
ye
building
a
house
which
shall
not
be
overthrown
,
and
the
world
shall
not
be
too
great
or
too
little
to
hold
it
:
for
indeed
it
shall
be
the
world
itself
,
set
free
from
evil
-
doers
for
friends
to
dwell
in
.
"
he
ceased
awhile
,
but
they
hearkened
still
,
as
if
something
more
was
coming
.
then
he
said
:
"
to
-
morrow
we
shall
take
the
road
for
rochester
;
and
most
like
it
were
well
to
see
what
sir
john
newton
in
the
castle
may
say
to
us
:
for
the
man
is
no
ill
man
,
and
hath
a
tongue
well
-
shapen
for
words
;
and
it
were
well
that
we
had
him
out
of
the
castle
and
away
with
us
,
and
that
we
put
a
word
in
his
mouth
to
say
to
the
king
.
and
wot
ye
well
,
good
fellows
,
that
by
then
we
come
to
rochester
we
shall
be
a
goodly
company
,

ere
we
come
to
blackheath
a
very
great
company
;
and
at
london
bridge
who
shall
stay
our
host
?
"
therefore
there
is
nought
that
can
undo
us
except
our
own
selves
and
our
hearkening
to
soft
words
from
those
who
would
slay
us
.
they
shall
bid
us
go
home

abide
peacefully
with
our
wives

children
while
they
,
the
lords

counsel
and
remedy
for
us
;

even
so

our
own
folly
bid
us

we
hearken
thereto
we
are
undone

fall
upon
our
peace
with
war

from
us

shall
hang
,

he
ended
amid
loud
shouts
;
but
straight
-
way
answering
shouts
were
heard
,
and
a
great
noise
of
the
winding
of
horns
,
and
i
misdoubted
a
new
onslaught
;
and
some
of
those
in
the
throng
began
to
string
their
bows
and
handle
their
bills
;
but
will
green
pulled
me
by
the
sleeve
and
said
:
"
friends
are
these
by
the
winding
of
their
horns
;
thou
art
quit
for
this
night
,
old
lad
.
"
and
then
jack
straw
cried
out
from
the
cross
:
"
fair
and
softly
,
my
masters
!
these
be
men
of
our
fellowship
,
and
are
for
your
guests
this
night
;
they
are
from
the
bents
this
side
of
medway
,
and
are
with
us
here
because
of
the
pilgrimage
road
,
and
that
is
the
best
in
these
parts
,
and
so
the
shortest
to
rochester
.
and
doubt
ye
nothing
of
our
being
taken
unawares
this
night
;
for
i
have
bidden
and
sent
out
watchers
of
the
ways
,

neither
a
man
'

son
nor
a
mare

son
may
come
in
on
us
without
espial
.
now
make
we
our
friends
welcome
.
forsooth
,
i
looked
for
them
an
hour
later
;
and
had
they
come
an
hour
earlier
yet
,
some
heads
would
now
lie
on
the
cold
grass
which
shall
lie
on
a
feather
bed
to
-
night
.
but
let
be
,
since
all
is
well
!
"
now
get
we
home
to
our
houses
,
and
eat
and
drink
and
slumber
this
night
,
if
never
once
again
,
amid
the
multitude
of
friends
and
fellows
;
and
yet
soberly
and
without
riot
,
since
so
much
work
is
to
hand
.
moreover
the
priest
saith
,
bear
ye
the
dead
men
,
both
friends
and
foes
,
into
the
chancel
of
the
church
,
and
there
this
night
he
will
wake
them
:

after
to

morrow
let
the
dead
abide
to
bury
their
dead
!
"
therewith
he
leapt
down
from
the
cross
,
and
will
and
i
bestirred
ourselves
and
mingled
with
the
new
-
comers
.
they
were
some
three
hundred
strong
,
clad
and
armed
in
all
ways
like
the
people
of
our
township
,
except
some
half
-
dozen
whose
armour
shone
cold
like
ice
under
the
moonbeams
.
will
green
soon
had
a
dozen
of
them
by
the
sleeve
to
come
home
with
him
to
board
and
bed
,
and
then
i
lost
him
for
some
minutes
,
and
turning
about
saw
john
ball
standing
behind
me
,
looking
pensively
on
all
the
stir
and
merry
humours
of
the
joyous
uplanders
.
"

said
he
,

i
see
thee
again
to

i
were
fain
of
speech
with
thee
;
for
thou
seemest
like
one
that
has
seen
more
than
most
.
"
"
yea

"
said
i
,

"
thither

said
he
,
smiling
kindly
,
"

lo
you

green
looking
for

that

me
.
but
in
his
house
will
be
song
and
the
talk
of
many
friends
;
and
forsooth
i
have
words
in
me
that
crave
to
come
out
in
a
quiet
place
where
they
may
have
each
one
his
own
answer
.
if
thou
art
not
afraid
of
dead
men
who
were
alive
and
wicked
this
morning
,
come
thou
to
the
church
when
supper
is
done
,
and
there
we
may
talk
all
we
will
.
"
will
green
was
standing
beside
us
before
he
had
done
,
with
his
hand
laid
on
the
priest
'
s
shoulder
,
waiting
till
he
had
spoken
out
;
and
as
i
nodded
yea
to
john
ball
he
said
:
"
now
,
master
priest
,
thou
hast
spoken
enough
this
two
or
three
hours
,
and
this
my
new
brother
must
tell
and
talk
in
my
house
;
and
there
my
maid
will
hear
his
wisdom
which
lay
still
under
the
hedge
e
'
en
now
when
the
bolts
were
abroad
.
so
come
ye
,
and
ye
good
fellows
,
come
!
"
so
we
turned
away
together
into
the
little
street
.
but
while
john
ball
had
been
speaking
to
me
i
felt
strangely
,
as
though
i
had
more
things
to
say
than
the
words
i
knew
could
make
clear
:
as
if
i
wanted
to
get
from
other
people
a
new
set
of
words
.
moreover
,
as
we
passed
up
the
street
again
i
was
once
again
smitten
with
the
great
beauty
of
the
scene
;
the
houses
,
the
church
with
its
new
chancel
and
tower
,
snow
-
white
in
the
moonbeams
now
;
the
dresses
and
arms
of
the
people
,
men
and
women
(
for
the
latter
were
now
mixed
up
with
the
men
)
;
their
grave
sonorous
language
,
and
the
quaint
and
measured
forms
of
speech
,
were
again
become
a
wonder
to
me
and
affected
me
almost
to
tears
.
i
walked
along
with
the
others
musing
as
if
i
did
not
belong
to
them
,
till
we
came
to
will
green
'
s
house
.
he
was
one
of
the
wealthier
of
the
yeomen
,
and
his
house
was
one
of
those
i
told
you
of
,
the
lower
story
of
which
was
built
of
stone
.
it
had
not
been
built
long
,
and
was
very
trim
and
neat
.
the
fit
of
wonder
had
worn
off
me
again
by
then
i
reached
it
,
or
perhaps
i
should
give
you
a
closer
description
of
it
,
for
it
was
a
handsome
yeoman
'
s
dwelling
of
that
day
,
which
is
as
much
as
saying
it
was
very
beautiful
.
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
it
,
the
last
house
in
the
village
,
was
old
or
even
ancient
;
all
built
of
stone
,
and
except
for
a
newer
piece
built
on
to
it
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
a
hall
,
it
seemed
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
had
round
arches
,
some
of
them
handsomely
carved
.
i
knew
that
this
was
the
parson
'
s
house
;
but
he
was
another
sort
of
priest
than
john
ball
,
and
what
for
fear
,
what
for
hatred
,
had
gone
back
to
his
monastery
with
the
two
other
chantrey
priests
who
dwelt
in
that
house
;
so
that
the
men
of
the
township
,
and
more
especially
the
women
,
were
thinking
gladly
how
john
ball
should
say
mass
in
their
new
chancel
on
the
morrow
.
will
green
'
s
daughter
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
door
and
gave
him
a
close
and
eager
hug
,
and
had
a
kiss
to
spare
for
each
of
us
withal
:
a
strong
girl
she
was
,
as
i
have
said
,
and
sweet
and
wholesome
also
.
she
made
merry
with
her
father
;
yet
it
was
easy
to
see
that
her
heart
was
in
her
mouth
all
along
.
there
was
a
younger
girl
some
twelve
summers
old
,
and
a
lad
of
ten
,
who
were
easily
to
be
known
for
his
children
;
an
old
woman
also
,
who
had
her
livelihood
there
,
and
helped
the
household
;
and
moreover
three
long
young
men
,
who
came
into
the
house
after
we
had
sat
down
,
to
whom
will
nodded
kindly
.
they
were
brisk
lads
and
smart
,
but
had
been
afield
after
the
beasts
that
evening
,
and
had
not
seen
the
fray
.
the
room
we
came
into
was
indeed
the
house
,
for
there
was
nothing
but
it
on
the
ground
floor
,
but
a
stair
in
the
corner
went
up
to
the
chamber
or
loft
above
.
it
was
much
like
the
room
at
the
rose
,
but
bigger
;
the
cupboard
better
wrought
,
and
with
more
vessels
on
it
,
and
handsomer
.
also
the
walls
,
instead
of
being
panelled
,
were
hung
with
a
coarse
loosely
-
woven
stuff
of
green
worsted
with
birds
and
trees
woven
into
it
.
there
were
flowers
in
plenty
stuck
about
the
room
,
mostly
of
the
yellow
blossoming
flag
or
flower
-
de
-
luce
,
of
which
i
had
seen
plenty
in
all
the
ditches
,
but
in
the
window
near
the
door
was
a
pot
full
of
those
same
white
poppies
i
had
seen
when
i
first
woke
up
;
and
the
table
was
all
set
forth
with
meat
and
drink
,
a
big
salt
-
cellar
of
pewter
in
the
middle
,
covered
with
a
white
cloth
.
we
sat
down
,
the
priest
blessed
the
meat
in
the
name
of
the
trinity
,
and
we
crossed
ourselves
and
fell
to
.
the
victual
was
plentiful
of
broth
and
flesh
-
meat
,
and
bread
and
cherries
,
so
we
ate
and
drank
,
and
talked
lightly
together
when
we
were
full
.
yet
was
not
the
feast
so
gay
as
might
have
been
.
will
green
had
me
to
sit
next
to
him
,
and
on
the
other
side
sat
john
ball
;
but
the
priest
had
grown
somewhat
distraught
,
and
sat
as
one
thinking
of
somewhat
that
was
like
to
escape
his
thought
.
will
green
looked
at
his
daughter
from
time
to
time
,
and
whiles
his
eyes
glanced
round
the
fair
chamber
as
one
who
loved
it
,
and
his
kind
face
grew
sad
,
yet
never
sullen
.
when
the
herdsmen
came
into
the
hall
they
fell
straightway
to
asking
questions
concerning
those
of
the
fellowship
who
had
been
slain
in
the
fray
,
and
of
their
wives
and
children
;
so
that
for
a
while
thereafter
no
man
cared
to
jest
,
for
they
were
a
neighbourly
and
kind
folk
,
and
were
sorry
both
for
the
dead
,
and
also
for
the
living
that
should
suffer
from
that
day
'
s
work
.
so
then
we
sat
silent
awhile
.
the
unseen
moon
was
bright
over
the
roof
of
the
house
,
so
that
outside
all
was
gleaming
bright
save
the
black
shadows
,
though
the
moon
came
not
into
the
room
,
and
the
white
wall
of
the
tower
was
the
whitest
and
the
brightest
thing
we
could
see
.
wide
open
were
the
windows
,
and
the
scents
of
the
fragrant
night
floated
in
upon
us
,
and
the
sounds
of
the
men
at
their
meat
or
making
merry
about
the
township
;
and
whiles
we
heard
the
gibber
of
an
owl
from
the
trees
westward
of
the
church
,
and
the
sharp
cry
of
a
blackbird
made
fearful
by
the
prowling
stoat
,
or
the
far
-
off
lowing
of
a
cow
from
the
upland
pastures
;
or
the
hoofs
of
a
horse
trotting
on
the
pilgrimage
road
(
and
one
of
our
watchers
would
that
be
)
.
thus
we
sat
awhile
,
and
once
again
came
that
feeling
over
me
of
wonder
and
pleasure
at
the
strange
and
beautiful
sights
,
mingled
.
with
the
sights
and
sounds
and
scents
beautiful
indeed
,
yet
not
strange
,
but
rather
long
familiar
to
me
.
but
now
will
green
started
in
his
seat
where
he
sat
with
his
daughter
hanging
over
his
chair
,
her
hand
amidst
his
thick
black
curls
,
and
she
weeping
softly
,
i
thought
;
and
his
rough
strong
voice
broke
the
silence
.
"
why
,
lads
and
neighbours
,
what
ails
us
?
if
the
knights
who
fled
from
us
this
eve
were
to
creep
back
hither
and
look
in
at
the
window
,
they
would
deem
that
they
had
slain
us
after
all
,
and
that
we
were
but
the
ghosts
of
the
men
who
fought
them
.
yet
,
forsooth
,
fair
it
is
at
whiles
to
sit
with
friends
and
let
the
summer
night
speak
for
us
and
tell
us
its
tales
.
but
now
,
sweetling
,
fetch
the
mazer
and
the
wine
.
"
"
forsooth
,
"
said
john
ball
,
"

ye

not
over

much

ye
shall
laugh

more

"
"

is

"
said
one
of
the
upland
guests
.
"
so
it
was
seen
in
france
when
we
fought
there
;
and
the
eve
of
fight
was
sober
and
the
morn
was
merry
.
"
"

said
another
,
"
but
there
,

it
was

the

,

"
for
now
will
green
had
a
bowl
of
wine
in
his
hand
.
he
stood
up
and
said
:
"

,

and
our
pruning

around

my
masters
!
"
then
he
drank
,
and
his
daughter
filled
the
bowl
brimming
again
and
he
passed
it
to
me
.
as
i
took
it
i
saw
that
it
was
of
light
polished
wood
curiously
speckled
,
with
a
band
of
silver
round
it
,
on
which
was
cut
the
legend
,
"
in
the
name
of
the
trinity

the
cup
and
drink
to
me
.
"
and
before
i
drank
,
it
came
upon
me
to
say
,
"
to
-
morrow
,
and
the
fair
days
afterwards
!
"
then
i
drank
a
great
draught
of
the
strong
red
wine
,
and
passed
it
on
;
and
every
man
said
something
over
it
,
as
"
the
road
to
london
bridge
!
"
"
hob
carter
and
his
mate
!
"
and
so
on
,
till
last
of
all
john
ball
drank
,
saying
:
"
ten
years
hence
,
and
the
freedom
of
the
fellowship
!
"
then
he
said
to
will
green
:
"

needs
depart
to
go
and
wake
the
dead

friend
and
foe
in
the
church
yonder
;
and
whoso
of
you
will
be
shriven
let
him
come
to
me
thither
in
the
morn
,
nor
spare
for
as
little
after
sunrise
as
it
may
be
.
and
this
our
friend
and
brother
from
over
the
water
of
thames
,
he
hath
will
to
talk
with
me
and
i
with
him
;
so
now
will
i
take
him
by
the
hand
:
and
so
god
keep
you
,
fellows
!
"
i
rose
to
meet
him
as
he
came
round
the
head
of
the
table
,
and
took
his
hand
.
will
green
turned
round
to
me
and
said
:
"
thou
wilt
come
back
again
timely
,
old
lad
;
for
betimes
on
the
morrow
must
we
rise
if
we
shall
dine
at
rochester
.
"
i
stammered
as
i
yea
-
said
him
;
for
john
ball
was
looking
strangely
at
me
with
a
half
-
smile
,
and
my
heart
beat
anxiously
and
fearfully
:
but
we
went
quietly
to
the
door
and
so
out
into
the
bright
moonlight
.
i
lingered
a
little
when
we
had
passed
the
threshold
,
and
looked
back
at
the
yellow
-
lighted
window
and
the
shapes
of
the
men
that
i
saw
therein
with
a
grief
and
longing
that
i
could
not
give
myself
a
reason
for
,
since
i
was
to
come
back
so
soon
.
john
ball
did
not
press
me
to
move
forward
,
but
held
up
his
hand
as
if
to
bid
me
hearken
.
the
folk
and
guests
there
had
already
shaken
themselves
down
since
our
departure
,
and
were
gotten
to
be
reasonably
merry
it
seemed
;
for
one
of
the
guests
,
he
who
had
spoken
of
france
before
,
had
fallen
to
singing
a
ballad
of
the
war
to
a
wild
and
melancholy
tune
.
i
remember
the
first
rhymes
of
it
,
which
i
heard
as
i
turned
away
my
head
and
we
moved
on
toward
the
church
:
"
on
a
fair
field
of
france
we
fought
on
a
morning
so
lovely
as
it
lieth
along
by
the
water
.
there
was
many
a
lord
there
mowed
men
in
the
medley
,
'
midst
the
banners
of
the
barons
and
bold
men
of
the
knighthood
,
and
spearmen
and
sergeants
and
shooters
of
the
shaft
.
"
we
entered
the
church
through
the
south
porch
under
a
round
-
arched
door
carved
very
richly
,
and
with
a
sculpture
over
the
doorway
and
under
the
arch
,
which
,
as
far
as
i
could
see
by
the
moonlight
,
figured
st
.
michael
and
the
dragon
.
as
i
came
into
the
rich
gloom
of
the
nave
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
i
had
one
of
those
white
poppies
in
my
hand
;
i
must
have
taken
it
out
of
the
pot
by
the
window
as
i
passed
out
of
will
green
'
s
house
.
the
nave
was
not
very
large
,
but
it
looked
spacious
too
;
it
was
somewhat
old
,
but
well
-
built
and
handsome
;
the
roof
of
curved
wooden
rafters
with
great
tie
-
beams
going
from
wall
to
wall
.
there
was
no
light
in
it
but
that
of
the
moon
streaming
through
the
windows
,
which
were
by
no
means
large
,
and
were
glazed
with
white
fretwork
,
with
here
and
there
a
little
figure
in
very
deep
rich
colours
.
two
larger
windows
near
the
east
end
of
each
aisle
had
just
been
made
so
that
the
church
grew
lighter
toward
the
east
,
and
i
could
see
all
the
work
on
the
great
screen
between
the
nave
and
chancel
which
glittered
bright
in
new
paint
and
gilding
:
a
candle
glimmered
in
the
loft
above
it
,
before
the
huge
rood
that
filled
up
the
whole
space
between
the
loft
and
the
chancel
arch
.
there
was
an
altar
at
the
east
end
of
each
aisle
,
the
one
on
the
south
side
standing
against
the
outside
wall
,
the
one
on
the
north
against
a
traceried
gaily
-
painted
screen
,
for
that
aisle
ran
on
along
the
chancel
.
there
were
a
few
oak
benches
near
this
second
altar
,
seemingly
just
made
,
and
well
carved
and
moulded
;
otherwise
the
floor
of
the
nave
,
which
was
paved
with
a
quaint
pavement
of
glazed
tiles
like
the
crocks
i
had
seen
outside
as
to
ware
,
was
quite
clear
,
and
the
shafts
of
the
arches
rose
out
of
it
white
and
beautiful
under
the
moon
as
though
out
of
a
sea
,
dark
but
with
gleams
struck
over
it
.
the
priest
let
me
linger
and
look
round
,
when
he
had
crossed
himself
and
given
me
the
holy
water
;
and
then
i
saw
that
the
walls
were
figured
all
over
with
stories
,
a
huge
st
.
christopher
with
his
black
beard
looking
like
will
green
,
being
close
to
the
porch
by
which
we
entered
,
and
above
the
chancel
arch
the
doom
of
the
last
day
,
in
which
the
painter
had
not
spared
either
kings
or
bishops
,
and
in
which
a
lawyer
with
his
blue
coif
was
one
of
the
chief
figures
in
the
group
which
the
devil
was
hauling
off
to
hell
.
"
yea
,
"
said
john
ball
,
"
'
tis
a
goodly
church
and
fair
as
you
may
see
'
twixt
canterbury
and
london
as
for
its
kind
;
and
yet
do
i
misdoubt
me
where
those
who
are
dead
are
housed
,
and
where
those
shall
house
them
after
they
are

who
built
this
house
for
god
to
dwell
in
.
god
grant
they
be
cleansed
at
last
;
forsooth
one
of
them
who
is
now
alive
is
a
foul
swine
and
a
cruel
wolf
.
art
thou
all
so
sure
,
scholar
,
that
all
such
have
souls
?
and
if
it
be
so
,
was
it
well
done
of
god
to
make
them
?
i
speak
to
thee
thus
,
for
i
think
thou
art
no
delator
;
and
if
thou
be
,
why
should
i
heed
it
,
since
i
think
not
to
come
back
from
this
journey
.
"
i
looked
at
him
and
,
as
it
were
,
had
some
ado
to
answer
him
;
but
i
said
at
last
,
"
friend
,
i
never
saw
a
soul
,
save
in
the
body
;
i
cannot
tell
.
"
he
crossed
himself
and
said
,
"
yet
do
i
intend
that
ere
many
days
are
gone
by
my
soul
shall
be
in
bliss
among
the
fellowship
of
the
saints
,
and
merry
shall
it
be
,
even
before
my
body
rises
from
the
dead
;
for
wisely
i
have
wrought
in
the
world
,
and
i
wot
well
of
friends
that
are
long
ago
gone
from
the
world
,
as
st
.
martin
,
and
st
.
francis
,
and
st
.
thomas
of
canterbury
,
who
shall
speak
well
of
me
to
the
heavenly
fellowship
,
and
i
shall
in
no
wise
lose
my
reward
.
"
i
looked
shyly
at
him
as
he
spoke
;
his
face
looked
sweet
and
calm
and
happy
,
and
i
would
have
said
no
word
to
grieve
him
;
and
yet
belike
my
eyes
looked
wonder
on
him
:
he
seemed
to
note
it
and
his
face
grew
puzzled
.
"
how
deemest
thou
of
these
things
?
"
said
he
:
"
why
do
men
die
else
,
if
it
be
otherwise
than
this
?
"
i
smiled
:
"
why
then
do
they
live
?
"
said
i
.
even
in
the
white
moonlight
i
saw
his
face
flush
,
and
he
cried
out
in
a
great
voice
,
"
to
do
great
deeds
or
to
repent
them
that
they
ever
were
born
.
"
"
yea
,
"
said
i
,
"
they
live
to
live
because
the
world
liveth
.
"
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
me
and
grasped
mine
,
but
said
no
more
;
and
went
on
till
we
came
to
the
door
in
the
rood
-
screen
;
then
he
turned
to
me
with
his
hand
on
the
ring
-
latch
,
and
said
,
"
hast
thou
seen
many
dead
men
?
"
"
nay
,
but
few
,
"
said
i
.
"
and
i
a
many
,
"
said
he
;
"
but
come
now
and
look
on
these
,
our
friends
first
and
then
our
foes
,
so
that
ye
may
not
look
to
see
them
while
we
sit
and
talk
of
the
days
that
are
to
be
on
the
earth
before
the
day
of
doom
cometh
.
"
so
he
opened
the
door
,
and
we
went
into
the
chancel
;
a
light
burned
on
the
high
altar
before
the
host
,
and
looked
red
and
strange
in
the
moonlight
that
came
through
the
wide
traceried
windows
unstained
by
the
pictures
and
beflowerings
of
the
glazing
;
there
were
new
stalls
for
the
priests
and
vicars
where
we
entered
,
carved
more
abundantly
and
beautifully
than
any
of
the
woodwork
i
had
yet
seen
,
and
everywhere
was
rich
and
fair
colour
and
delicate
and
dainty
form
.
our
dead
lay
just
before
the
high
altar
on
low
biers
,
their
faces
all
covered
with
linen
cloths
,
for
some
of
them
had
been
sore
smitten
and
hacked
in
the
fray
.
we
went
up
to
them
and
john
ball
took
the
cloth
from
the
face
of
one
;
he
had
been
shot
to
the
heart
with
a
shaft
and
his
face
was
calm
and
smooth
.
he
had
been
a
young
man
fair
and
comely
,
with
hair
flaxen
almost
to
whiteness
;
he
lay
there
in
his
clothes
as
he
had
fallen
,
the
hands
crossed
over
his
breast
and
holding
a
rush
cross
.
his
bow
lay
on
one
side
of
him
,
his
quiver
of
shafts
and
his
sword
on
the
other
.
john
ball
spake
to
me
while
he
held
the
corner
of
the
sheet
:
"
what
sayest
thou
,
scholar
?
feelest
thou
sorrow
of
heart
when
thou
lookest
on
this
,
either
for
the
man
himself
,
or
for
thyself
and
the
time
when
thou
shalt
be
as
he
is
?
"
i
said
,
"
nay
,
i
feel
no
sorrow
for
this
;
for
the
man
is
not
here
:
this
is
an
empty
house
,
and
the
master
has
gone
from
it
.
forsooth
,
this
to
me
is
but
as
a
waxen
image
of
a
man
;
nay
,
not
even
that
,
for
if
it
were
an
image
,
it
would
be
an
image
of
the
man
as
he
was
when
he
was
alive
.
but
here
is
no
life
nor
semblance
of
life
,
and
i
am
not
moved
by
it
;
nay
,
i
am
more
moved
by
the
man
'
s
clothes
and
war
-
gear
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
there
is
more
life
in
them
than
in
him
.
"
"
thou
sayest
sooth
,
"
said
he
;
"
but
sorrowest
thou
not
for
thine
own
death
when
thou
lookest
on
him
?
"
i
said
,
"
and
how
can
i
sorrow
for
that
which
i
cannot
so
much
as
think
of
?
bethink
thee
that
while
i
am
alive
i
cannot
think
that
i
shall
die
,
or
believe
in
death
at
all
,
although
i
know
well
that
i
shall
die
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i
can
but
think
of
myself
as
living
in
some
new
way
.
"
again
he
looked
on
me
as
if
puzzled
;
then
his
face
cleared
as
he
said
,
"
yea
,
forsooth
,
and
that
is
what
the
church
meaneth
by
death
,
and
even
that
i
look
for
;
and
that
hereafter
i
shall
see
all
the
deeds
that
i
have
done
in
the
body
,
and
what
they
really
were
,
and
what
shall
come
of
them
;
and
ever
shall
i
be
a
member
of
the
church
,
and
that
is
the
fellowship
;
then
,
even
as
now
.
"
i
sighed
as
he
spoke
;
then
i
said
,
"
yea
,
somewhat
in
this
fashion
have
most
of
men
thought
,
since
no
man
that
is
can
conceive
of
not
being
;
and
i
mind
me
that
in
those
stories
of
the
old
danes
,
their
common
word
for
a
man
dying
is
to
say
,
`
he
changed
his
life
.
'
"
"
and
so
deemest
thou
?
"
i
shook
my
head
and
said
nothing
.
"
what
hast
thou
to
say
hereon
?
"
said
he
,
"
for
there
seemeth
something
betwixt
us
twain
as
it
were
a
wall
that
parteth
us
.
"
"
this
,
"
said
i
,
"
that
though
i
die
and
end
,
yet
mankind
yet
liveth
,
therefore
i
end
not
,
since
i
am
a
man
;
and
even
so
thou
deemest
,
good
friend
;
or
at
the
least
even
so
thou
doest
,
since
now
thou
art
ready
to
die
in
grief
and
torment
rather
than
be
unfaithful
to
the
fellowship
,
yea
rather
than
fail
to
work
thine
utmost
for
it
;
whereas
,
as
thou
thyself
saidst
at
the
cross
,
with
a
few
words
spoken
and
a
little
huddling
-
up
of
the
truth
,
with
a
few
pennies
paid
,
and
a
few
masses
sung
,
thou
mightest
have
had
a
good
place
on
this
earth
and
in
that
heaven
.
and
as
thou
doest
,
so
now
doth
many
a
poor
man
unnamed
and
unknown
,
and
shall
do
while
the
world
lasteth
:
and
they
that
do
less
than
this
,
fail
because
of
fear
,
and
are
ashamed
of
their
cowardice
,
and
make
many
tales
to
themselves
to
deceive
themselves
,
lest
they
should
grow
too
much
ashamed
to
live
.
and
trust
me
if
this
were
not
so
,
the
world
would
not
live
,
but
would
die
,
smothered
by
its
own
stink
.
is
the
wall
betwixt
us
gone
,
friend
?
"
he
smiled
as
he
looked
at
me
,
kindly
,
but
sadly
and
shamefast
,
and
shook
his
head
.
then
in
a
while
he
said
,
"
now
ye
have
seen
the
images
of
those
who
were
our
friends
,
come
and
see
the
images
of
those
who
were
once
our
foes
.
"
so
he
led
the
way
through
the
side
screen
into
the
chancel
aisle
,
and
there
on
the
pavement
lay
the
bodies
of
the
foemen
,
their
weapons
taken
from
them
and
they
stripped
of
their
armour
,
but
not
otherwise
of
their
clothes
,
and
their
faces
mostly
,
but
not
all
,
covered
.
at
the
east
end
of
the
aisle
was
another
altar
,
covered
with
a
rich
cloth
beautifully
figured
,
and
on
the
wall
over
it
was
a
deal
of
tabernacle
work
,
in
the
midmost
niche
of
it
an
image
painted
and
gilt
of
a
gay
knight
on
horseback
,
cutting
his
own
cloak
in
two
with
his
sword
to
give
a
cantle
of
it
to
a
half
-
naked
beggar
.
"
knowest
thou
any
of
these
men
?
"
said
i
.
he
said
,
"
some
i
should
know
,
could
i
see
their
faces
;
but
let
them
be
.
"
"
were
they
evil
men
?
"
said
i
.
"
yea
,
"
he
said
,
"
some
two
or
three
.
but
i
will
not
tell
thee
of
them
;
let
st
.
martin
,
whose
house
this
is
,
tell
their
story
if
he
will
.
as
for
the
rest
they
were
hapless
fools
,
or
else
men
who
must
earn
their
bread
somehow
,
and
were
driven
to
this
bad
way
of
earning
it
;
god
rest
their
souls
!
i
will
be
no
tale
-
bearer
,
not
even
to
god
.
"
so
we
stood
musing
a
little
while
,
i
gazing
not
on
the
dead
men
,
but
on
the
strange
pictures
on
the
wall
,
which
were
richer
and
deeper
coloured
than
those
in
the
nave
;
till
at
last
john
ball
turned
to
me
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
.
i
started
and
said
,
"
yea
,
brother
;
now
must
i
get
me
back
to
will
green
'
s
house
,
as
i
promised
to
do
so
timely
.
"
"
not
yet
,
brother
,
"
said
he
;
"
i
have
still
much
to
say
to
thee
,
and
the
night
is
yet
young
.
go
we
and
sit
in
the
stalls
of
the
vicars
,
and
let
us
ask
and
answer
on
matters
concerning
the
fashion
of
this
world
of
menfolk
,
and
of
this
land
wherein
we
dwell
;
for
once
more
i
deem
of
thee
that
thou
hast
seen
things
which
i
have
not
seen
,
and
could
not
have
seen
.
"
with
that
word
he
led
me
back
into
the
chancel
,
and
we
sat
down
side
by
side
in
the
stalls
at
the
west
end
of
it
,
facing
the
high
altar
and
the
great
east
window
.
by
this
time
the
chancel
was
getting
dimmer
as
the
moon
wound
round
the
heavens
;
but
yet
was
there
a
twilight
of
the
moon
,
so
that
i
could
still
see
the
things
about
me
for
all
the
brightness
of
the
window
that
faced
us
;
and
this
moon
twilight
would
last
,
i
knew
,
until
the
short
summer
night
should
wane
,
and
the
twilight
of
the
dawn
begin
to
show
us
the
colours
of
all
things
about
us
.
so
we
sat
,
and
i
gathered
my
thoughts
to
hear
what
he
would
say
,
and
i
myself
was
trying
to
think
what
i
should
ask
of
him
;
for
i
thought
of
him
as
he
of
me
,
that
he
had
seen
things

with

i
have
played

been
merry
in
the
autumn
tide
about
the
edges
of
the
stubble
-
fields
;
and
we
gathered
the
nuts
and
bramble
-
berries
there
,
and
started
thence
the
missel
-
thrush
,
and
wondered
at
his
voice
and
thought
him
big
;
and
the
sparrow
-
hawk
wheeled
and
turned
over
the
hedges

the
weasel
ran
across
the
path
,

the
sound
of
the
sheep

bells
came
to
us
from
the
downs
as
we
sat
happy
on
the
grass
;
and
she
is
dead
and
gone
from
the
earth
,
for
she
pined
from
famine
after
the
years
of
the
great
sickness
;
and
my
brother
was
slain
in
the
french
wars
,
and
none
thanked
him
for
dying
save
he
that
stripped
him
of
his
gear
;

my
unwedded
wife

i
dwelt
in
love
after
i
had
taken
the
tonsure

all
men

she

good

fair

true
she
was

lovely

the
flesh

must
be
done

truly
,

this
is

an
old
tale
that
men
must
die

i

tell
thee
another

they
live

i
could
not
heed
him
as
a
living
man
as
much
as
i
had
done
,
and
the
voice
that
came
from
me
seemed
less
of
me
as
i
answered
:
"
these

valiant
as
any
that

been

shall
be

good
fellows
also

kindly
;

they
are
simple
,

see
no
great
way
before
their
own
noses

the
victory
shall
they
have
and
shall
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
;
they
shall
fight

overcome
,
because
of
their
lack
of
knowledge
,

because
of
their
lack
of
knowledge
shall
they
be
cozened
and
betrayed
when
their
captains
are
slain
,

all
shall
come
to
nought
by
seeming
;

the
king

shall
prevail
,

both
they

sadly

i
sat
for
long
without
speaking

the
church
grew
darker
as
the
moon
waned
yet
more
.

i
said

you

i

it
so

their

thine

if
the

be
enthralled

what
remedy
save
that
they
be
set
free
?
and
if
they
have
tried
many
roads
towards
freedom
,

found
that
they
led
no

whither
,
then
shall
they
try
yet
another
.
yet
in
the
days
to
come
they
shall
be
slothful
to
try
it
,
because
their
masters
shall
be
so
much
mightier
than
thine
,
that
they
shall
not
need
to
show
the
high
hand
,

until
the
days
get
to
their
evilest
,
men
shall
be
cozened
into
thinking
that
it
is
of
their
own
free
will
that
they
must
needs
buy
leave
to
labour
by
pawning
their
labour
that
is
to
be
.
moreover
,
your
lords

masters
seem
very
mighty
to
you
,
each
one
of

they
shall
be
very
many
,

they
shall
be
of
one
intent
in
these
matters
without
knowing
it

we
both
sat

a
little

the

was
gaining
on

slowly

i
looked
at

sweet
it
is
to
sleep
in
shadow
by
the
sun
in
the
full
morning

half

the

left
me

i
sat
down
again

heard
the
voice
of
john

at
first
as
one
speaking
from
far
away
,

little
by
little
growing
nearer

more
familiar
to

once
more
it

coming
from
the
man
himself

i

change
be
at
whiles

the
change

the
change

so
much

thee
questions

i
ask
thee

i
must
hasten
,

in
very
sooth
the

worn
old

grey

whereas
thou

that
in

there
shall
be
no
labouring
men
who
are
not
thralls
after
their
new
fashion
,
that
their
lords
shall
be
many

very
many

it
seemeth
to
me
that
these

lords
,
if
they
be
many
,
shall
hardly
be
rich
,

but
very
few
of
them
,
since
they
must
verily
feed
and
clothe

house
their
thralls
,
so
that
that
which
they
take
from
them
,
since
it
will
have
to
be
dealt
out
amongst
many

will
not
be
enough
to
make
many

out
of
one

ye
may

still
as

ye
may

him
so
sorely
as
not
to

him

therefore
,
though
the
eyes
of
my
mind
may
see
a
few
lords
and
many
slaves
,
yet
can
they
not
see
many
lords
as
well
as
many

if
the

be
many

the

few
,
then
some
day
shall
the
slaves

an
end

that
mastery
by
the
